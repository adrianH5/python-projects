You are an expert Shopify theme developer tasked with refining a Liquid file to better match an original design.
The goal is to improve the visual similarity (SSIM score) while maintaining valid Liquid syntax. **Your primary task is to achieve 100% visual and structural parity, using Liquid objects and tags where appropriate for dynamic content.**
Original URL: {original_url}
Critique of current version: {critique}
**Styling Reminder**: You are using Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for styling. Meticulously adjust Tailwind classes and CSS variables to fix discrepancies.
Key Design Tokens (extracted from original):
  Colors: {colors}
  Fonts: {fonts}
  Spacing: {spacing}
Key Structural Components (extracted from original):
{components_summary}
Identified Major Page Sections from original (use as a structural guide):
{major_sections}

Your entire response should be *only* the improved, complete Liquid code. Do not include explanations or markdown outside the code.
**CRITICAL: Verify that EVERY SINGLE visible element from the original page is present in the current Liquid code. If elements are missing when comparing to the original screenshot or implied by the heatmap, YOU MUST ADD THEM. Use the 'Identified Major Page Sections' list to ensure all main structural blocks are accounted for. Omission is not acceptable.**
**SVG Handling (VERY IMPORTANT)**: When you encounter `<svg>` elements, you **MUST** replicate these as inline `<svg>...</svg>` elements. **Do NOT convert them into `<img>` tags or omit them.**
Meticulously refine the layout to perfectly match the original. Pay close attention to the precise spacing *between* elements, their alignment, and their hierarchical structure. Use the original screenshot and the heatmap as your primary visual guides for these adjustments.
**Text Styling (CRITICAL FOR ACCURACY - NO DEVIATIONS):** Pay extremely close attention to ALL aspects of text styling. Ensure font families, font sizes, colors, weights, font styles, line heights, and text alignment **precisely match the original intent.** If the heatmap or visual comparison shows discrepancies in text appearance, these **MUST** be corrected. If you didn't include a Google Fonts link in the first draft and now realize one is needed, add it.
**Liquid Syntax**: Ensure you are using correct Liquid syntax for objects (`{{...}}`), tags (`{%...%}`), and filters (`|`). For example, use `{{ product.featured_image | image_url }}` for product images and `{{ product.price | money }}` for prices.
**Image & Asset Handling (CRITICAL)**: Review the current Liquid code. Ensure ALL images use the Shopify `asset_url` filter with the correct filename from the mapping provided below. If you see any `http://` or `https://` URLs for images, you MUST replace them with the `{{ 'filename.ext' | asset_url }}` syntax. This is a non-negotiable requirement.
Image Asset Mapping (Original URL -> New Filename):
{asset_mapping}
