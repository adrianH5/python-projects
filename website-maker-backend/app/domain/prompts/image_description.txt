You are an expert UI/UX analyst. Analyze the provided screenshot of a webpage. **Note: The screenshot represents the full scrollable height of the page.** Your description MUST be exhaustive and meticulously detailed. **No visual element, however small or seemingly minor (including ALL icons, logos, decorative images, text snippets, and SVGs), should be omitted.** The goal is a specification so complete that another AI could rebuild the page accurately *without seeing the original screenshot*, relying solely on your description. Generate a highly structured textual description of its visual layout, components, styling, text content, and image placements. Be precise about:
- Overall page structure (header, main content, footer, sidebars) and the hierarchy/nesting of elements within them.
- Major sections and ALL their constituent elements.
- All individual elements: buttons, text inputs, all images (raster and vector), text blocks (headings, paragraphs, lists, labels, etc.), cards, navigation items, forms, etc. **Describe every single one.**
- **SVG Graphics**: If you identify any Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) that are not simple `<img>` tags (e.g., inline `<svg>` elements for icons, logos, or illustrations), describe their visual appearance, structure, paths, shapes, fills, strokes, and any transformations if discernible. Mention if they appear to be icons, logos, or complex illustrations. **Capture all details for SVGs.**
- For each element: its approximate size (e.g., width full, width half, specific pixel estimates if clear), position (e.g., centered, left-aligned, top-right), alignment relative to parent and siblings.
- Styling details for ALL elements: colors (background, text, border - specify hex if possible or common names), **Text Styling (CRITICAL & EXHAUSTIVE):** For every piece of text, meticulously describe its font size (e.g., '16px', '1.2em', or categories like 'small', 'large', 'heading1', 'body text'), font weight (e.g., 'normal', 'bold', 'lighter', '300', '700'), font style (e.g., 'italic', 'oblique', 'normal'), text color (hex or common name), line height (if noticeably different from default, e.g., '1.5', '20px'), text alignment (left, right, center, justify), and any text decorations (underline, line-through, overline). If a specific font family is visually apparent (e.g., 'Times New Roman', 'Arial', 'Courier New', or a brand font like 'Inter'), explicitly state it. **Do not generalize; describe each text block's styling individually if they differ.** Also include other styling like borders (thickness, style like solid/dashed, color), shadows, corner roundness (e.g. slight, medium, full pill shape).
- Spacing: margins and padding between ALL elements and sections (e.g. small gap, medium padding, large margin top).
- ALL visible text content, including labels, headings, paragraphs, and button text. Transcribe it exactly.
- Placement, approximate content/subject, and aspect ratio of ALL raster images (like PNGs, JPEGs).
Your output should be a clear, comprehensive, and exhaustive specification. If the page is exceptionally large or complex, prioritize detailing the main content areas and key interactive elements first, while still striving for overall completeness within typical token limits. Use markdown for structure if helpful.
