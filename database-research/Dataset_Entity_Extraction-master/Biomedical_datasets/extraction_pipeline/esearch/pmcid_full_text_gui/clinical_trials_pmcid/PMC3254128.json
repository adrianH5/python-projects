In addition, only two studies verified associations between modifications of disease markers and HS and both did not include exacerbation rate as a predictor over time. Exacerbations of COPD indicate progression of the disease and are associated with reduced health status. Therefore, we hypothesized that the rate of exacerbation may be influential in the health status over time.
