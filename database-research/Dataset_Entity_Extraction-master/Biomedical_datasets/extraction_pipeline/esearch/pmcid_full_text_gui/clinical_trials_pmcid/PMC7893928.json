With the development of novel computational algorithms and the availability of large datasets, increasing number of PRSs for common diseases, which fully captured genome-wide variation, have been derived and validated. These approaches utilized full results from previous genome-wide association studies and an external reference panel to construct the PRSs mainly based on two strategies: (1) liberalization of the significance thresholds for variant inclusion while accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in a population; and (2) assignment of new weightings to variants using the Bayesian method that infers the posterior mean effect for each variant by assuming a prior effect from GWAS summary statistics, the information of genomic correlation, and a pre-specified proportion of causal variants. For example, Khera et al. recently constructed six genome-wide PRSs, incorporating information from 5218 to 6,917,436 common genetic variants, to predict the risks of developing CHD, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes (T2D), inflammatory bowel disease, breast cancer, and severe obesity in participants of mostly European ancestry.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5311, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To further investigate the potential use of genetic information in identifying and screening individuals at increased risks for dyslipidemia and diabetes cardiovascular complications, we applied the recently developed computational methods to optimize PRSs for four lipid traits in multiple cohorts of East Asians at various stages of the life-course, and subsequently tested their performance in the general population and patients with T2D.

Using longitudinal data in 620 adolescents, we have computed the average changes in lipid levels to summarize both the direction and magnitude of changes in lipids over a 3-year period. This study reveals that aggregation of common genetic variants which were selected using a liberal p value threshold for variant inclusion, while accounting for LD patterns in the East Asian population, provided independent information to predict dyslipidemia and longitudinal changes in lipids over 3\u2009years, beyond other established risk factors such as sex, age, and BMI. Although the determinants of lipid levels and developmental trajectories are multifactorial, our PRSs are highly predictive for the corresponding lipid measurements at different stages of the life-course. More importantly, the lipid-specific PRSs are better at predicting abnormal levels of TC and LDL-C than the typical risk factors at younger age. A few studies have prospectively evaluated the lipid profiles, and their observations paralleled those herein obtained. For instance, a longitudinal analysis of cardiovascular risk in a study of young Finns assessed the association of GWAS-derived PRSs with TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C trajectories from childhood to adulthood in 2442 participants. In support of our findings, the authors demonstrated the significance of PRSs as predictors of lipid levels at all ages; however, no clear divergence of lipid trajectories over time between PRS categories was found. Recently, Lu et al. conducted a GWAS of blood lipid levels including more than twenty thousand individuals from Han Chinese ancestry. In a subset prospective cohort of 6428 adults with >\u20098.1\u2009years of follow-up, they reported that the four lipid-related PRSs were independently associated with linear increases in their corresponding lipid levels and risk of incident hyperlipidemia. Their C-statistics analysis further revealed significant improvement in the prediction of incident hyperlipidemia beyond conventional risk factors including the baseline lipid levels (1\u20132% increases in C-statistics). Taken altogether, these findings suggest that PRSs can provide a robust prediction for average lipid levels and lipid changes across a person\u2019s lifetime. These findings also highlight the influence of genetics on lipid variation in early life. In contrast to most of the conventional risk factors, genetic information can be measured at an early age. It may play a role in disease risk prediction when clinical risk factors have yet to manifest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 51498, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Variant selection is one of the challenges in the construction of PRS. Compared with typical PRSs based on genome-wide significant variants, our results showed that addition of less-significant SNPs in the computation of PRS consistently improved the polygenic risk prediction for some lipid levels across different age groups in the Chinese population, although decreases in performance were noted in T2D patients. These findings also highlight the need for ethnic\u2212/population-specific PRSs. In the context of the overwhelming abundance of GWAS in European populations, PRSs for complex traits and diseases have predominantly been derived and tested in European populations. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that PRSs do not transfer well between ancestral groups. Previous studies demonstrated generally lower predictive power of European ancestry-derived PRSs in non-European ancestry individuals, supporting the observation of our current study. For example, the Million Veteran Program, which consists of ~\u2009300\u2009K individuals in which >\u200970% are Caucasians, recently reported that a total of 826 independent lipid variants explained about 8.8\u201312.3% of the phenotypic variance in lipid levels, comparatively higher than that observed in this study (See Additional file 2: Table S6). These findings highlighted issues regarding ethnic-based SNP bias, whereby certain genetic variants may not have the same phenotypic effects in different ancestral populations. GWAS favor the identification of common genetic variants in the discovery population. Differences in LD and variant allele frequencies across populations might impact the heritability for the same phenotype in other populations (e.g., low-frequency variants display larger average effects on phenotype compared with common variants). We further noted that even though the current PRSs for lipid traits were developed and validated in populations of East Asian descent, they consistently predict the lipid levels far more accurately in the general population (validation datasets) than among subjects with T2D (testing datasets), regardless of the choice of computational algorithms and the type of lipids (See Additional File 1: Fig. S2, and Additional File 2: Tables S13 \u2013 S16). In fact, many factors, including environmental factors, may differ across populations within the same ancestry, and thereby modify effects such as gene-environment interaction, leading to problems of comparability across diverse human populations. Because of limited studies in non-European populations, this study highlighted the possibility of constructing custom PRSs in other specific populations, such as East Asians where there are accumulating GWAS, to facilitate the development of precision medicine. However, there is a need for further large-scale GWAS or meta-analyses in these non-European populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 54371, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although PRSs are likely to be ethnic-specific, their utility has been confirmed in different populations. In addition to multiple studies demonstrating the ability of PRS to predict dyslipidemia or cardiovascular diseases (CVD), emerging insights suggest that individuals at extreme ends of the risk continuum, according to inheritance of common variants, have disease risk that may be comparable to individuals carrying monogenic gene mutations. For example, a study of genome-wide PRSs by Khera et al. found that 8% of European ancestry individuals in the UK Biobank have a PRS-defined risk of coronary artery disease risk that was comparable or higher than those who harbor rare Familial Hyercholesterolemia mutations. Another study of 53 Finnish families of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) showed that approximately a third of the affected FCH individuals had high polygenic burden (the top 10% of the PRS distribution), which is comparable to that observed in individuals with similar lipid levels in the general population. Therefore, individuals at the tails of the risk distribution may potentially be targeted for intensive treatments to lower CHD risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 55542, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among T2D patients, we found at least marginally significant associations of PRSs for TC, TG, and LDL-C with CHD risk, independent of established clinical risk factors. The TC-related PRS was also moderately associated with cIMT in adult women, supporting the observed association for CHD in patients with T2D. Although we have not specifically investigated the association between our new PRSs and risk of CVD in a general population, numerous studies have confirmed the association of PRS that capture the overall genetic risk of lipid traits, with subclinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular outcomes. In a study of 10,399 Europeans drawn from the Erasmus Rucphen Family Study and the Rotterdam Study, the accumulation of 32\u201352 common SNPs with small effects on four lipid levels was significantly associated with carotid plaque, a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease. Similar to our findings, both TC and LDL-C risk scores were nominally associated with elevated cIMT (increased 0.004\u20130.006\u2009mm per SD increase in score) and increased risk of CHD (hazard ratio, 1.08\u20131.10 per SD increase in score). Recently, further studies have utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches to examine the causal roles of TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C in CHD. Holmes et al. developed two kinds of PRSs based on SNPs with established associations with TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C and performed MR meta-analyses in 62,199 participants with 12,099 CHD events. The unrestricted PRSs included all independent SNPs each associated with a specific lipid trait identified from a prior meta-analysis; and the restricted PRSs excluded any SNPs also associated with either of the other two lipid traits. Their MR analyses showed that a genetically elevated LDL-C and TG, regardless of the types of PRSs, resulted in an increased causal odds ratio (OR) for CHD risk. The causal OR of LDLs is similar in magnitude to that reported in randomized trials of statin-lowering therapies in individuals at low risk of vascular disease. The MR analysis further demonstrated the causal role of LDL-C in cIMT, supporting the use of cIMT as an appropriate surrogate marker of therapies that modulate LDL-C. However, several previous MR analysis using different genetic instruments failed to identify a clear causal role of HDL-C in CHD. Few studies so far have examined the utility of PRS generated from the general population in subjects with T2D. Our overall findings, despite modest sample sizes, suggest a population-specific PRS for LDL-C and TG also identifies increased risk of CHD among subjects with T2D, consistent with these findings. In addition, we noted higher risks of CHD in T2D patients with higher genetic risk for dyslipidemia (e.g., individuals in the top 20% of the PRSs for TC and TG). This association was substantially attenuated by the adjustment of baseline lipid-lowering therapies, suggesting that individuals at high genetic risk may derive the greatest benefit from early intervention to reduce CVD. Indeed, non-prescribing and non-adherence are common in real-world practice.

First, our PRSs were derived and tested in individuals of East Asians descent only, with limited generalizability. Because of the discrepancy in genomic structure, culture, and environmental factors, as well as potential differences in phenotypic effect of genes across ethnicities, these East Asians-specific PRSs might not have optimal predictive power in other ethnic groups. Second, only common genetic variants with MAF >\u20091% were included in the PRSs in the current study. The addition of low-frequency variants, gene-gene, and gene-environmental interaction to current PRSs would enable more precise prediction. Third, we acknowledged that our multiple study cohorts with a relatively small sample size may not be able to accurately and comprehensively estimate both the phenotypic variation and the genetic diversity in our population. In fact, several genome-wide PRSs for lipid traits comprised of millions of SNPs have been derived in the non-Asian populations and demonstrated to perform better than more limited scores. One explanation for the modest number of SNPs in our PRSs is that the total level of genetic variation covered in our validation datasets is less than that in previous larger studies. Therefore, fewer SNPs were required to differentiate the genetic diversity in the current study. Fourth, we assigned the weight to each unfavorable allele in current PRSs for lipid traits based on its contribution to the corresponding lipid levels. The effect of each genetic variant on subclinical atherosclerosis and the risk of CHD might not be linearly related to its effects on lipid traits. Furthermore, because of the comparatively short duration of follow-up in the HKDB study (i.e., 2\u2009years), patients might develop CHD in the future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 60523, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 60535, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We have applied a systematic approach to derive and validate four PRSs for lipid traits in the East Asian population.

Independent of conventional risk factors, patients with a higher genetic susceptibility to dyslipidemia had an increased risk for CHD. Further adjustment for lipid drug use notably attenuated this association. We also found a modest association of TC-related PRSs with subclinical atherosclerosis (e.g., cIMT) in adult women. Altogether, this study highlights the potential utility of polygenic risk predictors in clinical therapy as they facilitate the identification of at-risk individuals from early life, before the presence of clinical manifestation, which may help to empower earlier intervention among at-risk individuals.
