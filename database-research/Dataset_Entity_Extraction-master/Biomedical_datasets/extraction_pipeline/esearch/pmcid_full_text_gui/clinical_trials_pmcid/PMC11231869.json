Specifically, IL-12 acts directly on T cells via the IL-12 receptor, and induces differentiation of CD4+ T cells toward a Th1 program, promoting production of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) which supports cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 has also been demonstrated to support effector memory T cell development and oppose angiogenesis. In a B16 melanoma tumor model, IL-12 expressed within tumor nodules mediated recruitment of leukocytes inclusive of CD8+ T cells into the tumor. The subsequent use of recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) across multiple pre-clinical models replicated the anti-tumor properties of IL-12, including liver tumors.

Additionally, sunitinib or gemcitabine also exhibited increased efficacy in combination with NHS-muIL12 compared to either drug alone in a Lewis lung carcinoma model. HAIP chemotherapy presents a unique combinational approach alongside NHS-IL12 for the treatment of liver tumors, such as metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). HAIP therapy exploits the hepatic artery derived blood supply of liver tumors, allowing direct infusion of floxuridine (FUDR) to the local tumor environment. Hepatic artery infusion of FUDR has been shown to promote tumor cell death and has a 94\u201399% first pass-metabolism by the liver, facilitating high dose delivery of drug directly to the liver while limiting systemic side effects.
