T-cell activation requires at least two signals: the presentation of an antigen to the T-cell receptor by a major histocompatibility complex molecule on an antigen presenting cell, and interaction of the T-cell with other receptors that either enhance or inhibit the T-cell response. CD28 and CTLA-4 competitively interact with the B7-1 and B7-2 ligands located on the antigen presenting cell, with antagonistic effects. CD28 enhances T-cell activation and IL-2 production and CTLA-4 antagonizes T-cell activation by interfering with IL-2 secretion and IL-2 receptor expression. IL-2 stimulates T-cell growth, but has also been implicated in the expansion of regulatory T-cells that express CTLA-4. CTLA-4 binds to B7-1 and B7-2 ligands with greater affinity than CD28. Although CD28 is constitutively expressed on naive T-cells, CTLA-4 becomes functional only after T-cell activation. This temporal delay in CTLA-4 upregulation allows for initial T-cell activation by CD28, followed by a regulatory feedback loop mediated by CTLA-4.

Studies using flow cytometry to compare cell surface marker expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after treatment with ipilimumab, in combination with interleukin-2 therapy, showed that HLA-DR, a marker of T-cell activation, increased after treatment on CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD4\u2212 (likely CD8+) cells. The second mechanism is via depletion of tumor-induced CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cell (Tregs), which inhibit immune response to tumor-associated antigens. Tregs are a suppressive CD4 T-cell population that expresses CD25 (the high affinity IL-2\u03b1 receptor subunit). Tregs also produce immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10. Additionally, an increase in T helper 17 (Th17) cells, a distinct lineage of CD4+ T-cells producing specific cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22), was associated with fewer relapses in a Phase II study of 75 patients treated with ipilimumab (3 or 10 mg/kg) alone or in combination with melanoma-specific peptides.

These NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients are more responsive to ipilimumab than NY-ESO-1-seronegative patients. Furthermore, NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients with associated CD8(+) T-cells experienced greater clinical benefit (77%) than those with undetectable CD8(+) T-cell response (14%). Inducible costimulator (ICOS), a member of the immunoglobulin gene family, is expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells following activation. ICOS functions as a costimulatory molecule on activated T-cells and increases effector T-cell survival. An increase in the frequency of CD4+ ICOS-high cells is seen in patients treated with ipilimumab, compared to untreated melanoma patients or healthy volunteers. This increase may be associated with a clinical benefit at week 24 and an increased survival. Another antigens associated to melanocyte differentiation, the melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP or livin) is overexpressed in melanoma and contributes to disease progression and to treatment resistance.

Novel criteria for the evaluation of antitumor responses with immunotherapeutic agents have been proposed after a detailed analysis of the Phase II clinical trial program with ipilimumab. Ipilimumab monotherapy results in four distinct response patterns: (1) shrinkage in baseline lesions, without new lesions; (2) durable stable disease (in some patients followed by a slow, steady decline in total tumor burden over a period of months); (3) response after an increase in total tumor burden; and (4) response in the presence of new lesions.

Consequently, antitumor response has been associated with a higher incidence of autoimmunity reactions, which can be severe but are commonly manageable with steroids. There is currently no evidence that the use of steroids reduces the response mechanism fueled by ipilimumab. Ipilimumab yields prolonged antitumor effects in 20%\u201330% of patients with melanoma; however, the effect of this immunotherapy takes many weeks to peak.

The current 12-week benchmark may not be long enough to determine response to ipilimumab and patients should be observed longer. The immune response generated in the first few weeks of therapy, may be wrongly interpreted as progressive disease on radiological imaging.

The appearance of new lesions may also be related to immune-mediated inflammation in previous areas of subclinical micro-metastases.
