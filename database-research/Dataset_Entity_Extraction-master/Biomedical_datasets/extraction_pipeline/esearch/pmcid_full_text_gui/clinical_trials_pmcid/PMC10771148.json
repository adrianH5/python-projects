Previously, patients with advanced ovarian cancer were treated with cytoreductive surgery in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. This regimen showed a good initial response, but most of the patients receiving the treatment usually relapsed which led to the trials of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, in the treatment of primary or relapsed ovarian tumor.

The findings are summarized in the PRISMA flow chart. Three authors (MM, MZ, and ET) performed a systematic literature search using databases such as MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane Library using the medical search terms and their respective entry words with the following search strategy: \u201cbevacizumab, platinum-based, chemotherapy, primary, relapsed, ovarian cancer and literature\u201d. Additionally, unpublished trials were identified from the clinicaltrials.gov website and references of all pertinent articles were also scrutinized to ensure the inclusion of all relevant studies. The search was completed on November 1, 2021, and we only included studies available in English. Four authors (MM, MZ, ET, and PM) independently screened the search results in a two-step process based on predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. First 756 articles were evaluated for relevance on the title and abstract level, followed by a full-text screening of the final list of 200 articles. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third-party review, and a total of five articles were included in the study. The following eligibility criteria were used: original articles reporting the efficacy of bevacizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of primary and relapsed ovarian cancer as compared to control groups receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. All articles emphasizing the importance of bevacizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of primary or relapsed ovarian cancer were included in the study. Only five articles met the selection criteria for eligibility. All qualifying studies were nationwide inpatient or pooled clinical trial data. The reasons for the exclusion of the other 55 articles were irrelevant (n = 25), duplicate (n = 16), reviews (n = 7), and poor data reporting (n = 7). Out of the five included studies, all five studies showed improvement in progression-free survival with combination therapy when compared with control. Three studies supported improvement in overall survival with combination therapy, while two studied favored overall survival with only platinum-based control therapy. Four studies showed a correlation between adverse effects including hypertension, proteinuria, arterial and venous thromboembolism, wound healing complications, posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and Gastrointestinal (GI) events, while three studies showed a correlation between adverse effects including neutropenia, bleeding, and congestive heart failure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4818, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 12 months, while secondary endpoints include overall survival and adverse effects including hypertension, proteinuria, arterial and venous thromboembolism, wound healing complications, PRES, congestive heart failure, neutropenia, bleeding, and GI events.

Summary estimates of the clinical endpoints were then calculated with risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity between studies was examined with the Cochran's Q-based I2 statistic, which can be defined as low (25% to 50%), moderate (50% to 75%), or high (>75%).
