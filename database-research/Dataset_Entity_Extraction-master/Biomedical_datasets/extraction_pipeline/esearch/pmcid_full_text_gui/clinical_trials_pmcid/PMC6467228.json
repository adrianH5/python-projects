By contrast, there is no intermediate conversion of x rays to visible light in a direct-conversion detector such as amorphous-selenium (a-Se). In these detectors, selenium atoms are ionized by x rays, creating electron-hole pairs. Based on an applied electric field, the electrons and holes migrate to opposite surfaces of the detector, and an image is formed.

Rather than calculate a single PSF that models all possible sources of blurring, Que and Rowlands identified multiple x-ray interactions that could introduce blurring, and modeled the PSF for each interaction separately.
