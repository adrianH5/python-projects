Male infertility, which is mainly associated with disorders in sperm such as low sperm count, poor sperm quality, or both, accounts for up to 50% of all infertility cases. Among them, decreased motility (asthenozoospermia, AZS) which is characterized by reduced spermatozoa forward motility (progressive motility <\u200a32%), is one of the most frequent types of male infertility, and affects approximately 40% of all cases. Idiopathic asthenozoospermia was defined when the etiology was unknown. For decades, despite greater understanding of male infertility in recent years, idiopathic sperm abnormalities still account for about 30 percent of male infertility. Male infertility has a seriously negative impact on a man's physical, psychological, emotional well-being, especially family harmony, or even social relationships.

Asthenozoospermia can be a consequence of genital tract infection, abnormal hormone levels, varicocele, systemic diseases, environmental factors, or be the result of changes that have not yet been recognized at the molecular level. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction reported in AZS men came to attention, several studies reported this dysfunction is related to idiopathic asthenozoospermia, since sperm motility is regulated by intrinsic factors, and requires an appropriate supply of adenosine triphosphate. For adenosine triphosphate synthesis, these gradients are generated by electron transfer maintained by the inner mitochondrial layer. Then energy storage in mitochondria is related to proton concentration and electric potential gradient in cell membrane. The energy state of mitochondria is described by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which regulates intact functional mitochondria and is significantly correlated with the motility of sperm. Thus, we said the functional competence of the sperm can be evaluated by measuring the inner MMP in spermatozoa. It has been observed that highly progressive motility sperms do have higher MMP as compared to infertile males with impaired motility, and they are usually morphologically normal and can undergo acrosome reaction invariably at the same time. Therefore, analyse the function of mitochondria may provide a way to distinguish sperm motility and MMP can be considered as a potential regulator and indicator of sperm motility.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4959, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Due to unknown etiology and complex pathogenesis, there are no specific therapies to effectively treat the idiopathic asthenozoospermia infertility, and a number of drugs are empirically managed using in the clinic. Some studies of antioxidants have tended to show that semen parameters may benefit from supplements of carnitine, vitamin E, Selenium, or N-acetylcysteine. However, the therapeutic potential of antioxidant remains debated, since limited by sample size. In recent years, L-Carnitine (LC) has attracted extensive attention in treating male infertility. LC which is mainly of exogenous origin not synthesized is an essential substance in the process of fatty acid oxidation, and plays an important role in the production and transport of energy in cells. In the study of Lenzi and collaborators, an interesting aspect has been found: there is a high concentration of carnitine in the male reproductive tract, particularly in the epididymis, representing its key role in energy metabolism and sperm maturation. Given this finding, it is now known that the accumulation of LC in ejaculation may be a marker of epididymal function. LC has been used as a treatment approach in patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia, just mainly based on the crucial role of it in energetic metabolism and its concentration in epididymis. Some controlled and uncontrolled studies suggest the potentially positive effects of LC and its acyl derivatives in the treatment of some forms of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.

In the theory of TCM, the kidney is the place to store kidney essence, which plays an important role in reproduction. Most experts believe that idiopathic AZS is closely associated with the dysfunction of the viscera, especially the disorder of the kidney. Several studies have revealed the active components of herbal medicine that nourish kidney-essence, support blood circulation in the reproductive system, and control testosterone secretion. They have been shown to significantly improve sperm motility in animal studies. And also shown positive effects in the enhancement of the parameters of sperm in men with infertility. Some small-sample clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of Yishentongluo decoction (YSTL) as complementary therapy for idiopathic asthenospermia. Our previous study suggested that YSTL significantly improved sperm quality and sperm deoxyribonucleic acid integrity in patients with varicocele-associated asthenospermia combined with minimally invasive surgery.

Since lack of a cause for the worsened semen quality, idiopathic AZS is the most often and most troublesome one among the types of male infertility. AZS can not just be considered as a simple condition in isolated diseases, on the contrary, it is always associated with a comprehensive symptom. Hence, patients with AZS represent a very diverse group actually, and treating this particular patient group is not an easy task. Some scholars found that food supplements may improve seminal fluid conditions by providing energy to male germ cells and protecting these cells from oxidative stress. However, many drugs be used to treating idiopathic male infertility is empirically managed, and the data of drug efficacy are highly heterogeneous.

Several research data illustrate that the pathogenesis of male infertility is mainly related to dysfunctional mechanisms in the kidney, liver, and spleen, with the involvement of phlegm and blood stasis. The goal of therapy is to balance the reproductive energy (qi), blood, and the yin and yang of internal organs. Treatment based on syndrome differentiation is the most representative character of TCM in recognizing and treating diseases. Therefore, we regard syndrome differentiation as one of the inclusion criteria of participants, namely kidney deficiency and blood stasis. YSTL has been proved as an effective prescription for treating male infertility diagnosed for kidney deficiency and blood stasis. Some studies have reported that the TCM components of Cuscuta chinensis Lam., Epimedium brevicornum Maxim., and Rehmannia glutinosa can reduce reactive oxygen species, improve sperm motility, and effectively increase pregnancy rate.

According to existing studies, sperm motility depends on mitochondrial function and could be better evaluated by the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). We use the PR sperm rate (%) as the main efficacy indicator of this trial. The PR+NP sperm rate (%), total effective sperm count, spouse pregnancy rate (%), and inner MMP in spermatozoa are the secondary efficacy indicators, to provide more reference for efficacy evaluation. Besides, electrocardiogram, blood tests (including blood routine test, hepatic function, and renal function), urine routine test, and stool routine test are safety indicators.
