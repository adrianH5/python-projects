Our gene unification method employs an algorithm (fjoin\u2014feature join) for efficient detection of genome coordinate overlaps among features represented in two annotation data sets. Following the analysis with fjoin, genome features are binned into six possible categories (1:1, 1:0, 0:1, 1:n, n:1, n:m) based on coordinate overlaps. These categories are subsequently prioritized for assessment of annotation equivalencies and differences. The version of the unified catalog reported here contains more than 59,000 entries, including 22,599 protein-coding coding genes, 12,455 pseudogenes, and 24,007 other feature types (e.g., microRNAs, lincRNAs, etc.). More than 23,000 of the entries in the MGI gene catalog have equivalent gene models in the annotation files obtained from NCBI, Vega, and Ensembl. 12,719 of the features are unique to NCBI relative to Ensembl/Vega; 11,957 are unique to Ensembl/Vega relative to NCBI, and 3095 are unique to MGI. More than 4000 genome features fall into categories that require manual inspection to resolve structural differences in the gene models from different annotation sources.

Although conceptually simple, generating a complete and non-redundant list of genome features can be challenging because there are multiple major independent genome annotation providers that use different methods for predicting genes. Each of these genome annotation processes generates a set of gene models in which some predictions are unique to a particular pipeline. Even when genes are predicted in common, there are often differences in exon structure and inconsistencies in nomenclature. The accession identifiers associated with the predictions also differ among the various providers. As a consequence, a list of genes downloaded from one source does not always match a gene list obtained from a different source. Further, there are a number of annotation projects that specialize in specific types of genome features such as regulatory regions (Yue et al.) and functional RNAs (Chan and Lowe; Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones).

While a trivial-nested loop can find all pairs of overlapping features in two inputs files, the running time grows geometrically with the file sizes. Fjoin performs the same computation far more efficiently; comparison of two genome annotation files with hundreds of thousands of annotated features takes only minutes to perform. Genome features with overlapping coordinates form bipartite graphs, which are separated and categorized according to the number of participating top-level features. The categories are labeled by cardinality: 1:1, 1:0, 0:1, 1:n, n:1, and n:m (Fig.\u00a01). These groupings make it easier to target gene sets that require manual inspection to resolve annotation discrepancies. The 1:1 category includes instances where a feature in one annotation file overlaps one, and only one, genome feature in the second annotation file, and vice versa. The 1:0 and 0:1 categories include features that are unique to one of the annotation files.
