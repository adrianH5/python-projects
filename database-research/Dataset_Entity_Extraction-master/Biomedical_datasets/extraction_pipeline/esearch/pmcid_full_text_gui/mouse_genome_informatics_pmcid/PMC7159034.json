Our classifier attains the highest precision (0.698), recall (0.784), f-measure (0.738) and MCC (0.711) when we used features selected from the titles, abstracts and image captions (right solid black column in Figure 2). Such performance statistically significantly exceeds that attained based on the title-and-abstracts alone (, two-sample t-test for all measures). Furthermore, the precision, f-measure and MCC attained using image captions alone (0.696, 0.721 and 0.690, respectively) are statistically significantly higher than those attained using the title and abstract (, two-sample t-test). Such improvement strongly indicates that image captions indeed provide significant information for supporting biocuration triage. As described in the Experiments section, the average length of each title-and-abstract in our dataset is about 200 words per document, while the total image captions per document amount to about 1000 words on average. In the experiments where we use only the title and the abstract for training/testing the base-classifier, the number of features selected is ~5000, while the number of features identified when we use image captions alone is ~15\u2009000. That is, as image captions comprise more words in total than titles and abstracts, captions provide a larger number of informative features for supporting classification.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23731, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": " Figure 2 also shows that combining title-and-abstracts with image captions attained significantly higher recall, f-measure and MCC (, two-sample t-test) compared to that of our classifier based only on image captions, while slightly improving the level of precision.

In contrast, due to the inherent \u2018black-box\u2019 nature of neural networks, it is difficult to trace the decision-making process in the CNN classifiers. Moreover, timewise, each of the five cross validation runs of our classifier (see Experiments), has taken <40\u00a0min (wall clock), while each cross validation run of the CNN classifier has taken over 4\u00a0h (wall clock).

The approach presented by Burns et\u00a0al. adopts a pre-trained CNN configuration that uses available software packages and as such appears less complex. However, training such a neural network configuration requires setting over 10 parameters (e.g. the dimensionality of the word embedding vectors, the batch size and the number of epochs in the network training process, dropout rate). In contrast, our scheme requires setting only four parameters, namely the threshold defining rare terms, the threshold for defining overly frequent terms, the width of sub-intervals (w) for feature binning and the number of base-classifiers (k).
