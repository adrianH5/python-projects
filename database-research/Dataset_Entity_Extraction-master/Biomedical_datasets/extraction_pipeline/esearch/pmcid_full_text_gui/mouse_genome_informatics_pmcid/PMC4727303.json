Comparisons with three previously reported CNV studies using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip Array showed that CNVRs detected in this study overlapped 65.7\u00a0% of the CNVR calls reported by Hou et al., 13.4\u00a0% of the CNVR calls reported by Jiang et al., and 10.5\u00a0% of the CNVR calls reported by Zhang et al. (Table\u00a02 and Additional file 1: Table S2). The results were likely due to the different criteria used for the determination of CNV and the number of samples and breeds used in each study. CNV was defined as containing three or more consecutive SNPs in Hou et al., in Zhang et al., and in this study, whereas it was defined to contain 10 or more consecutive SNPs in Jiang et al. (Additional file 1: Table S1). In the initial CNV discovery, we used three SNP windows, which is a less strict criterion than that in the study by Jiang et al. (Additional file 1: Table S1).

The increased number of consecutive SNPs may infer reliable CNV detection compared to a smaller number of SNPs, although the increased number of consecutive SNPs cannot capture small CNVRs.

The Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology in Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) is the most comprehensive phenotypic database that enables the annotation of phenotypes in a genetic context.

Several different bovine Ensembl gene IDs were connected with a single MGI ID, such as T cell receptor family and olfactory receptor family (Additional file 1: Table S7), and several bovine Ensembl gene IDs did not connect with a MGI ID (Additional file 1: Table S7); therefore, the number of converted mouse orthologous genes was reduced.

In particular, knockout mice for bovine orthologous genes in loss-type CNVRs may provide important information on phenotypic expression of CNV events in cattle.
