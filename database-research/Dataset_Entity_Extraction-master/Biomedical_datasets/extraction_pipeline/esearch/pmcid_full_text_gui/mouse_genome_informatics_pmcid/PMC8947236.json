So far, little is known about the biological mechanism(s) underlying these associations. In an initial step, we now aimed to identify allele-specific target genes of hsa-miR-4513. We performed RNA sequencing in a miRNA overexpression model in human umbilical vein endothelial cells transfected with separated hsa-miR-4513 alleles at rs2168518, namely hsa-miR-4513-G and hsa-miR-4513-A. Genes specifically regulated by the rs2168518 alleles were independently verified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot analysis and allele-specific miRNA binding via a luciferase reporter assay. By a text-based search publicly available databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and Mouse Genome Informatics were utilized to link target genes of hsa-miR-4513 to previously described phenotypes. Overall, we identified 23 allele-specific hsa-miR-4513 target genes and replicated 19 of those independently via qRT-PCR. Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assays conducted for an exemplary subsample further confirmed the allele-specific regulation of these genes by hsa-miR-4513. Remarkably, multiple allele-specific target genes identified are linked via text retrieval to several phenotypes previously reported to be associated with hsa-miR-4513.

Against this background, we aimed to identify allele-specific target genes of hsa-miR-4513 by applying an undirected RNA-Seq approach. Primary endothelial cells transfected with the allelic seed sequence variants of hsa-miR-4513 were considered an adequate model. Overall, we identified 15 specific target genes of the hsa-miR-4513-G allele and eight specific target genes of the hsa-miR-4513-A allele. An independent validation of the findings confirmed 11 targets of hsa-miR-4513-G and the eight target genes of hsa-miR-4513-A. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assays of the 3\u2032-UTRs of selected allele-specific hsa-miR-4513 target genes further confirmed the strict binding specificity.

In fact, a consistent and statistically significant allele-specificity was observed for three target genes, namely CDKN2A, CD2BP2 and KLF6. Difficulties in the replication of allele-specificity may be attributable to differences in the cell lines used, namely HUVECs for target gene identification and validation and HEK293T cells for investigation of allele-specific miRNA binding, alternatively to the timing between transfection and cell harvest for the various tests. Of note, the high exogenous expression of hsa-miR-4513 is likely not comparable with physiological expression of this miRNA, which is usually expressed at much lower levels. In case both alleles allow binding to the target transcript, although with a varying degree of binding specificity, the high expression in our experiments might obscure allele-specific effects. To investigate the impact of the hsa-miR-4513 seed polymorphism in a physiological context, a dataset with a large sample size will be needed in which both endogenous miRNA and mRNA expression data are provided simultaneously. Such data are currently not available. Unfortunately, also not in a large dataset like the one provided by the genotype-tissue expression project as mature miRNAs are not covered in the respective expression sequence data.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26883, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An interesting allele-specific target gene of hsa-miR-4513 identified in this study is CDKN2A. Proteins encoded by CDKN2A include p14 and p16 and exhibit crucial functions in cell cycle regulation as well as tumor suppression. Consistent with its role in cancer, Cdkn2a knockout mice reveal a systemic phenotype affecting a variety of tissues and cellular processes. A complete loss of a gene, as described in the MGI database, as well as pathogenic mutations, which in the case of CDKN2A can lead to hereditary cancer in human, are expected to display much stronger effects than regulatory influences such as those exerted by hsa-miR-4513. Overall, the systemic effect of CDKN2A expression can be reconciled with the highly pleiotropic associations found for hsa-miR-4513 and its seed polymorphism rs2168518. In our study, CDKN2A was downregulated in an allele-specific way by hsa-miR-4513-A. Interestingly, Ghanbari and colleagues reported a lower expression of hsa-miR-4513-A in comparison with hsa-miR-4513-G in a transient transfection model using HEK293 cells. Based on such findings, we suggest that the allele-specific downregulation of CDKN2A is diminished due to a lower expression of the hsa-miR-4513-A allele. Furthermore, studies have shown that p14 and p16 expression increases with increasing age and that the presence of p16 in senescent cells is associated with age-related pathologies. As a consequence, small allele-specific regulatory effects may only become apparent with an increase in target gene expression or by effects accumulating with age. This would also fit with the associations found for hsa-miR-4513 and its seed polymorphism rs2168518 with age-related phenotypes such as cancer, cardiovascular conditions and age-related macular degeneration. In summary, allele-specific regulation of CDKN2A by hsa-miR-4513-A is a promising mechanism that could explain the association of the miRNA locus with seemingly unrelated age-related pathologies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28856, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It should be noted that the approach chosen in this study aimed to identify allele-specific target genes of hsa-miR-4513.

The latter effects still could influence genes in proximity and may be causative for the association signals reported in previous studies. Another explanation for the associations detected at this locus could be an expression quantitative trait locus, where a polymorphism has a regulating effect on the expression of nearby genes, eventually by altering a transcription factor binding site. To this end, several studies have reported regulatory effects of rs2168518, or of highly linked variants, on several genes located within the same locus as hsa-miR-4513, including the miRNA host gene CSK. Due to the exogenously increased miRNA expression following our study design, it is difficult to speculate about a possible co-expression of hsa-miR-4513 and its host gene CSK and its consequences.
