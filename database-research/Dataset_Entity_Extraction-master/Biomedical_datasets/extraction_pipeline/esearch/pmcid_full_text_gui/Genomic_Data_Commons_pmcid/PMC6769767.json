PanDrugs is an in silico drug prescription method which prioritizes anticancer drugs combining both biological and clinical evidence.

Patients labelled as responders according to PanDrugs predictions showed a significantly increased overall survival (OS) compared to non-responders. PanDrugs was also able to suggest alternative tailored treatments for non-responder patients. Additionally, PanDrugs usefulness was assessed considering spatial and temporal ITH in cancer patients and showed that ITH can be approached therapeutically proposing drugs or combinations potentially capable of targeting the clonal diversity.

ITH arises as a result of the evolving process tumoural cells suffer during their growth and propagation. ITH can be spatial (variability in different locations) and temporal (variability over the temporal evolution of the tumour). Nevertheless, current common clinical practice does not take into account ITH, using exclusively a therapy administration strategy based on bulk analysis results and limiting the effectiveness of the treatments. What can happen in these cases is that the tumoural cells underlying sequenced clones could be favoured by the administration of the treatment and settle, perpetuating the tumour. Incorporating ITH assessment to other molecular profiling approaches would add more resolution on the study of tumour biology and evolution. Moreover, understanding ITH would be valuable for designing successful therapeutic strategies in the context of precision oncology paradigm.

To do so, we applied PanDrugs on cancer patients\u2019 molecular profiles allowing us to stratify them based on sensitivity/resistant predictions relating them to the survival outcome available in the GDC repository. In particular, patients who received molecular-targeted therapy based on EGFRi were chosen since its prescription is mostly guided by molecular evidence following current clinical guidelines. PanDrugs results in EGFRi-treated patients showed significant Kaplan\u2013Meier plots for OS (p = 0.013) exhibiting the consistency amongst PanDrugs predictions and patients\u2019 outcome. Remarkably, PanDrugs was able to a priori identify those potential non-responder patients who showed a worse outcome. Moreover, for these non-responder patients (48.5%) PanDrugs was able to propose alternative therapeutic options. This underlines the usefulness of PanDrugs as a complement tool in clinical decision making.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28715, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Nevertheless, our approach is clearly limited in several aspects. In spite of the GDC initiative representing a great effort to make genomic and clinical data accessible and standardised, current clinicopathological annotations are still incomplete. Clinical studies usually incorporate clinicopathological annotation data like age, gender, tumour stage and survival information, however, this is not sufficient. A more complete and curated annotation of patients\u2019 treatment must be systematically collected and improved including full therapeutic regimens, measure of response, drug efficacy, relapse time and overall response. Such annotations are essential to develop computational models for predicting drug response and, consequently, to identify drug response biomarkers and novel drug targets amongst others.

Thus, using an AML patient\u2019s genome, we were able to propose approved drugs to hit minority clones (VAF < 0.1%) detected at early stages which were positively selected after chemotherapy causing relapse. Next, subclonal populations detected by multiregion sequencing of NSCLC patients were targeted with different treatments to hit both clonal (trunk) and subclonal alterations suggesting potential drug combinations and personalized therapeutic regimens.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30959, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, our findings highlight the need that in silico drug prescription tools should consider: i) the tumour clonal heterogeneity, ii) the allelic frequency of druggable genes, iii) the pre-existence of drug resistance clones and iv) the clonal dynamics of a tumour under selective pressure.

Clonotherapy would cover the concept of targeting clonal alterations (trunk) and subclone populations with different drugs.

Firstly, only ~4000 out of >11,000 GDC patients are matched with genomic and clinicopathological data (including drug-response information). When we aim to apply an a priori stratification focused on specific targeted therapy (e.g., EGFRi) the number of patients is drastically reduced to few clinical cases (n = 147). This constraint our statistical power, limiting the robustness of our conclusions; for this reason, the present study should be considered as a proof of concept. In addition, we did not perform a comprehensive comparison amongst ITH analysis and standard bulk analysis; instead, we assumed the predominant clone population as an approximation to what would be detected by standard bulk sequencing. Finally, our results suggest that the impact of the clonotherapy approach is variable since in certain cases, the therapeutic options proposed do not differ from bulk standard prescription. This also limits our conclusions and, therefore, a more systematic analysis is needed in future studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32915, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study is focused on how in silico drug prescription methods could be improved. To this end, it will be crucial to employ large, standardised and well-annotated patient datasets with genomic and complete clinicopathological data associated. This is mandatory to provide validation datasets for the assessment of novel drug response predictive methods and to identify novel predictive biomarkers based on retrospective studies. In addition, knowing that the current catalogue of known gene\u2013drugs relationships is mostly based on genomic alterations (e.g., single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), CNVs and gene fusions), other information layers must be incorporated. For instance, advances in single-cell technologies also represent a promising alternative to bulk sequencing since they offer a comprehensive profiling of tumour genetics, transcriptomics and epigenomics to study clonal architecture and tumour evolution and progression. In the present study, we have highlighted the utility of the ITH information layer to propose therapies considering spatial and temporal tumour progression. We believe that this strategy will identify more potential drug targets while covering as much tumour clonality as possible in cancer patients.
