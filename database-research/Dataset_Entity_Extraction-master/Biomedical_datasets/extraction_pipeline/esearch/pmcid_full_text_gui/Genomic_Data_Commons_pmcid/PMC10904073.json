Being able to predict such nonresponders would hence permit the undelayed administration of more promising treatments while sparing gemcitabine life-threatening side effects for those patients. Unfortunately, the few predictors of PAAD patient response to this drug are weak, none of them exploiting yet the power of machine learning (ML). Methods: Here, we applied ML to predict the response of PAAD patients to gemcitabine from the molecular profiles of their tumors. More concretely, we collected diverse molecular profiles of PAAD patient tumors along with the corresponding clinical data (gemcitabine responses and clinical features) from the Genomic Data Commons resource. From systematically combining 8 tumor profiles with 16 classification algorithms, each of the resulting 128 ML models was evaluated by multiple 10-fold cross-validations. Results: Only 7 of these 128 models were predictive, which underlines the importance of carrying out such a large-scale analysis to avoid missing the most predictive models. These were here random forest using 4 selected mRNAs [0.44 Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), 0.785 receiver operating characteristic\u2013area under the curve (ROC-AUC)] and XGBoost combining 12 DNA methylation probes (0.32 MCC, 0.697 ROC-AUC). By contrast, the hENT1 marker obtained much worse random-level performance (practically 0 MCC, 0.5 ROC-AUC). Despite not being trained to predict prognosis (overall and progression-free survival), these ML models were also able to anticipate this patient outcome. Conclusions: We release these promising ML models so that they can be evaluated prospectively on other gemcitabine-treated PAAD patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1985, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1998, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the seventh leading cause of death among all cancers (495,773 new cases and 466,003 deaths worldwide in 2020).

Such gemcitabine-containing treatments generally offer enhanced patient survival and clinical benefit. The anti-proliferative properties of gemcitabine come from inhibiting DNA synthesis. Gemcitabine requires intracellular phosphorylation to be converted into its active form, difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP), which competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into DNA during DNA elongation, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. However, 54% of gemcitabine-treated PC patients can exhibit primary resistance. It is therefore important to find an effective way to anticipate which patients will benefit from gemcitabine.

In addition, we also investigated the differential expression of gemcitabine response predictors and found that increased 4 mRNA expressions and DNA methylation of 11 CpG sites in pretreatment biopsies from gemcitabine-treated PAAD patients are correlated with better response to therapy, while increased DNA methylation of cg03208198 predicts resistance to therapy (Fig. 4). In fact, dysregulation of DNA methylation (hypo- or hypermethylation) is related to affected gene activation or associated with gene silencing including known tumor suppressor genes and loss of gene functions in cancer. Some of the genes corresponding to the predictive CpG probes have been previously reported to be associated with the prognosis and clinical outcomes in various cancers. The high expression of COL18A1 in PC, gastric cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma showed poor clinical outcomes. Down-regulation of CRIP1 has also been identified in invasive PC. ZNF703 is an oncogenic transcriptional regulator involved in cell adhesion, movement, and proliferation. Overexpression of ZNF703 is linked to tamoxifen resistance. From this subset of predictive genes, we carried out PPI and pathway analyses to further support follow-up mechanistic studies.

Second, an independent validation cohort would further test the generalizability of the best model, i.e., whether this is able to stratify patients with different characteristics or technical validations (e.g., sample preparation, sequencing procedure, and bioinformatics pipeline). With that said, this is not critical here as it is when using clinical trial data, as TCGA data come from clinical practice in different hospitals.
