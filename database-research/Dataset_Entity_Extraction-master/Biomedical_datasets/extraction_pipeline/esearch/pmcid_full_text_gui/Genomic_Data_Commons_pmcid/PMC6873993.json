Although gene expression\u2013based patient stratification strategies have been published for numerous cancer studies, the reproduction and validation of the derived gene signatures across different laboratories or profiling platforms have proven to be a complex and difficult informatics problem. In classification, the main goal is to derive a probabilistic model for predicting the class membership of a new observation (patient with ovarian cancer) on the basis of a training set of data (tumor samples) that contains observations (eg, gene expression measures) for which class membership is already known. A considerable overlap of the molecular subtypes exists among various HGSOC publications, but these studies were solely based on gene-level expression estimates and ignored the variability associated with splice/transcript variants. Although aberrant expression of splice variants in ovarian cancer has been reported, the current study is the first to our knowledge that has explored the use of isoform-level transcriptome in the molecular subtyping of ovarian cancer. Our isoform-level subtypes provide more prognostic information than the gene-level subtypes that were previously reported. Similar overall prognostic significance among the four molecular subtypes have been reported, but we noticed some inconsistencies between independent data sets. For example, we observed similar overall prognostic significance and pairwise (D v M, I v M) survival differences in both TCGA (Fig 1D) and independent data sets (Fig 3). However, the survival difference between the I and M subtypes was inconsistent between the TCGA and the other two cohorts, which could be due to differences in the patient population and errors in the subtype calls on data from different platforms. Although the univariable Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed both D and I isoform-based subtypes as significantly different in their OS from the M subtype, multivariable Cox PH regression analysis showed only the I subtype as significantly different from the M subtype after adjusting for the clinical variables.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 23752, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Having established improved association of the refined subgroups with the OS, we translated the exon array\u2013based classification system to independent platforms. The testing of the derived models on data from two independent platforms showed a high level of cross-platform (exon array to RNA-seq) consistency and accuracy (> 90%) without loss of analytic precision. In addition, the classification system simplified the interplatform translation with the selection of a small subset of genes and/or transcript variants as feature variables. The small set of genes/transcript variants for molecular classification will be clinically useful and cost effective for patient subgroupings and a key resource to develop precision medicine strategies further. For example, molecular subtypes with poor prognoses (P and M subgroups) have been reported to benefit from treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab. Furthermore, patients in the P subgroup are sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition (veliparib). These data provide a rational basis for selecting specific treatments for histologic and molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer. A major limitation of the classification system is the requirement of the tumor transcriptome profile from either a microarray or a next-generation sequencing platform. To translate the assay to a low-dimensional platform, such as quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or NanoString (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA), additional experiments are required on an independent patient cohort. In addition, the combining of the molecular subtype information with pathologic subtypes, advanced imaging analytics, and radiomics approaches would enable improved precision diagnostics and treatment planning.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 25563, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, we developed a new platform-independent isoform-level classification system for efficient and accurate stratification of patients with HGSOC with prognostic significance.
