This study aimed to identify gene copy number alterations (CNAs) with prognostic values and to determine if any combination of gene CNAs could have risk stratification potentials. Clinical and genomic data of 500 PCa cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas stable were retrieved from the Genomic Data Commons and cBioPortal databases. The CNA statuses of a total of 52 genetic markers, including 21 novel markers and 31 previously identified potential prognostic markers, were tested for prognostic significance. The CNA statuses of a total of 51/52 genetic markers were significantly associated with advanced disease at an odds ratio threshold of \u22651.5 or \u22640.667. Moreover, a Kaplan\u2013Meier test identified 27/52 marker CNAs which correlated with disease progression. A Cox Regression analysis showed that the amplification of MIR602 and deletions of MIR602, ZNF267, MROH1,\u00a0PARP8, and HCN1 correlated with a progression-free survival independent of the disease stage and Gleason prognostic group grade. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression analysis identified twenty-two panels of markers with risk stratification potentials. The best model of 7/52 genetic CNAs, which included the SPOP alteration, SPP1 alteration, CCND1 amplification, PTEN deletion, CDKN1B deletion, PARP8 deletion, and NKX3.1 deletion, stratified the PCa cases into a localised and advanced disease with an accuracy of 70.0%, sensitivity of 85.4%, specificity of 44.9%, positive predictive value of 71.67%, and negative predictive value of 65.35%.

Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1971, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "According to the GLOBOCAN 2020 Cancer Statistics, prostate cancer (PCa) is the 4th most common type of cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2020 after female breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. It is also the most common cancer diagnosed in men, the 8th most common cause of cancer deaths in 2020, and the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths in men. Currently, risk prediction for individual cases is highly prioritised in PCa management. While most cases behave indolently and most patients die with their tumours, a substantial fraction of patients develops an aggressive disease, which requires radical therapy. However, because it is difficult for urologists to adequately predict the disease progression for individual cases, many PCa patients may receive aggressive management strategies, which are associated with reduced quality of life post-procedure. It is currently difficult to differentiate indolent from aggressive cancers based on clinicopathological parameters alone. The current best prognostic index\u2014the Gleason grading of histopathological samples\u2014has limitations in predicting the clinical behaviour of individual tumours: interobserver variation is high, grading scores for small diagnostic needle biopsies differ significantly from that of a prostatectomy specimen for each individual due to sampling problems, and morphologically identical samples may exhibit different clinical behaviours. Over the years, many studies have investigated the molecular pathology of PCa. However, the relationship between molecular alterations and clinicopathological indices of PCa is not yet fully understood. Many studies have shown that gene CNAs are more important than somatic mutations. However, no single molecular marker has been validated for risk stratification in this disease. The molecular alterations that can predict clinical aggressiveness and metastatic potentials of individual cancers are not fully established. An understanding of the molecular alterations that drive cancer progression and aggressiveness is essential to formulating the most appropriate management strategies. In this study, we explored the TCGA PCa cohort to (i) identify genes with CNA statuses that can potentially predict the clinical progression of PCa and (ii) determine whether any combination of genetic markers can stratify PCa cases into early- and late-stage diseases with any degree of accuracy.

For example, the CNAs of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, such as PIK3CA, CHD1, MYC, PTEN, CCND1, CDKN1B, TP53, CCNE1, NKX3.1, and RB1, have previously been shown to impact prognosis, tumour progression, and disease stage of PCa and other cancers. Furthermore, molecular alterations of androgen receptor pathway genes, including AR, MED12, FOXA1, NCOR1, NCOR2, SPOP, NCOA2, and ZBTB16, have similarly been associated with different disease stages. Besides AR, NCOA2, and ZBTB16, whose copy number changes were previously associated with late-stage diseases, the molecular alterations found in other members of the pathway were mainly somatic point mutations and altered expressions. However, this study found that MED12, FOXA1, NCOR1, NCOR2, and SPOP exhibited copy number changes that were associated with disease stages. In addition, the gene expression patterns of FGFR1, CLU, CLIC4, and PMP22 were used to stratify PCa with low Gleason scores into aggressive and indolent groups in the Irshad et al. study. This study included the CNA status of FGFR1, CLU, CLIC4, and PMP22 in the study since gene CNA generally correlates with gene expression levels and found that the CNA status of FGFR1, CLU, CLIC4, and PMP22 individually showed significant associations with PCa stage. In addition, CLU CNAs robustly fit into the logistic regression models 9, 10, 19, and 21 (Supplementary Data\u2014Logistic Regression Models). CDKN2A deletion has been associated with prognosis in other cancers, such as gliomas, but not in PCa. This present study showed a CDKN2A deletion, an alternative mechanism of CDKN2A loss in PCa apart from the CDKN2A methylation revealed by the Ameri et al. study. This study also showed that CDKN2A deletion, like CDKN2A methylation, is associated with prognosis. A CDKN2A deletion also robustly fit into the regression models 6, 16, and 18 (see Supplementary Data\u2014Logistic Regression Models), evidence that the CDKN2A deletion can be combined in a panel of CNAs for PCa risk stratification. Somatic point mutation and upregulation of BCL2 expression was associated with PCa progression by Catz and Johnson and Renner et al.. In this study BCL2 alterations were predominantly deletion events (27.52% of cases had deletion versus 1.44% with amplification, see Supplementary Data\u2014PCa Stage Odds Ratios). However, both BCL2 amplification and deletion were positively associated with disease stage in this study. Although BCL2 deletion and reduced expression may appear counterintuitive for tumour cell survival and carcinogenesis, it should be noted that BCL2-deleted tumour cells may alternatively upregulate one or more members of the BCL2 family of anti-apoptotic genes, such as MCL-1 and BCL2L1, to increase cell survival.

In their models, which are supported by our data, ETV6 acts as a tumour suppressor gene that negatively regulates the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and disease progression in PCa cells. The ETV6 deletion also fit into our predictive regression models 3, 7, 13, and 17 (Supplementary Data\u2014Logistic Regression Models). The activities of ETV4 in cell lines and xenograft models, on the other hand, are those of an oncogene, and the ETV4 overexpression has been associated with metastasis. This study found PCa stage associations for both the ETV4 deletion and amplification. The amplification statuses of TMPRSS2 and ERG were associated with the PCa stage in this present study, which is in concordance with previous studies. However, TMPRSS2 fusion, ERG fusion, and the specific TMPRSS2\u2013ERG fusion were not associated with a disease stage in this study. These findings are in congruence with the Toubaji et al. study, which found that an increased copy number of ERG, but not TMPRSS2\u2013ERG fusion, predicted the outcome in PCa, and with the Albadine et al. study, which did not find any significant difference in rate of TMPRSS\u2013ERG fusion between minute and non-minute PCa. The failure of the TMPRSS2\u2013ERG fusion to stratify PCa cases into early and late stages may be because the fusion is an early clonal event in prostate carcinogenesis. In addition, the expression levels of SPP1 have been associated with clinical stages, lymph node metastasis, and disease-free survival in PCa. CNAs of SPP1 were found to associate with disease stage, but not with survival, in this study. Furthermore, the SPP1 alteration fit into all but one of our regression models.

A search of the literature revealed that the CNAs of these genes have not previously been documented to be related to PCa prognosis or risk stratification. We showed that MIR602 amplification, MIR602 deletion, ZNF267 deletion, PARP8 deletion, MROH1 deletion, and HCN1 deletion were associated with progression-free survival independent of the disease stage and prognostic group grade. ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24250, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "MIR602 maps to chromosome 9q34.3; encodes miR-602, a microRNA that promotes cell proliferation and metastases; and regulates the cell cycle in an oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line model, in which it targets FOXK2. MIR602 is also involved in Hedgehog signalling in chondrocytes and has anti-apoptotic activities in hepatocellular carcinoma. It is upregulated in gliomas and colon cancers. MIR602 overexpression has been associated with a poor prognosis in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and in glioblastoma multiforme and a favourable outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The expression of MIR602 is epigenetically regulated. The present study showed that whilst both forms of MIR602 alterations (i.e., amplification and deletion) were associated with disease progression, only MIR602 amplification was significantly associated with disease stage and the regression models. Whilst ZNF267 behaves as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma, in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in which its expression also predicts poor survival, this study found that ZNF267 amplification is associated with the disease stage but not with progression-free survival. The ZNF267 deletion, on the other hand, showed the reverse profile. Jiang et al., in a genome-wide association study of 5222 PCa patients, found that an inherited MROH1 variant (or single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) was one of the genetic factors that would warrant conversion of management strategies from active surveillance to treatment. Zhang et al. found that MROH1 was frequently altered as part of a chromosome 8q alteration in various cancers, including PCa. Furthermore, Sharbatoghli et al. found that MROH1 amplification is a predictive marker of drug response in ovarian cancer management. Moreover, Harada et al. found that somatic mutations of MROH1, among other genes, were associated with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma relative to the primary tumour. In comparison, the present study found that an MROH1 amplification was significantly more common in advanced disease than in localised tumours and can potentially stratify PCa into stages (regression model 17). In addition, the MROH1 deletion was associated with a progressed disease in the TCGA PCa cohort. PARP8 encodes PARP8, a member of the family of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase with DNA repair, genome stability maintenance, and cellular homeostasis functions. A specific function is yet to be described for PARP8 per se, but PARP8 localises to the nuclear envelope for the majority of the cell cycle, except during mitosis when it localises to the centrosome and spindle poles; hence, it may function in the maintenance of the mitotic spindle apparatus. It also functions in the cellular apoptotic pathway. This present study found that PARP8 deletion showed risk stratification potentials and robustly fit into 8 of our 22 regression models (see Supplementary Data\u2014Logistic Regression Models). It was also inversely associated with progression-free survival. HCN1 maps to chromosome 5p12 and encodes HCN1, a member of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN1-HCN4) protein family whose expression was normally localised to the heart and nervous system. HCN1 SNPs have been associated with both risk and prognosis. Phan et al. found that HCN1 mRNA was overexpressed in prostate and other cancers, and this expression pattern was associated with an adverse overall survival in breast and colorectal cancers. Two other members of the HCN family, HCN2 and HCN3, were shown to be overexpressed in clinical breast cancer and to have adverse prognostic significance; they were also predictive markers for ivabradine response in in vitro breast cancer models. No survival significance was stated for prostate cancer in that study. On the other hand, we found associations between HCN1 amplification/deletion and disease stage in this PCa study. HCN1 deletion also fit into 7 of our 22 regression models that stratified the PCa cohort into early- and late-stage diseases (see Supplementary Data\u2014Logistic Regression Models) and independently predicted disease progression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28435, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study has explored the TCGA PCa cohort and identified new gene CNAs with risk-stratification potentials.
