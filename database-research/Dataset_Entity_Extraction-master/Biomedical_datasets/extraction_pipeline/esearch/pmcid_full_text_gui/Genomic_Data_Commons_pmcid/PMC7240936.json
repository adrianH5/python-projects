Frequent SMGs were taken as potential therapeutic targets, however, only specific patients are suitable for certain forms of therapeutic strategies. Meanwhile, many SMGs were un-druggable. A comprehensive understanding about the down-stream processes of the SMGs can help improve the efficiency of precision medicine and provide alternative therapeutic targets. According to our analysis, we identified 18 SMGs with significant mutations in LUSC. These SMGs, especially NFE2L2, TP53 and RASA1 were related with the expressional alterations of large number of genes. The activity of NFE2L2 is known to be mainly regulated via its interaction with KEAP1 (Bryan et al.). Here, we observed that mutations of NFE2L2 and KEAP1 were highly co-exclusive, suggesting the convergent down-stream effects. A SMG down-stream gene analysis showed that the down-stream functions of all SMGs where both NFE2L2 and KEAP1 exhibited significant influences on the pathways of mTOR signaling and inflammation responses (Fig.\u00a03) which have been reported (Bendavit et al.; Kobayashi et al.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27162, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Nearly half of the potential down-stream regulated genes can generate significant prognostic impacts. However, the expressional alterations underlying the same SMG can also lead to opposite prognostic effects. The complex molecular features of LUSC make it impossible to predict the prognosis with respect to single SMG or its relevant down-stream pathways. Here, to obtain a more comprehensive perspective, we recognized two LUSC subtypes (termed C1 and C2) by clustering the TCGA-LUSC patients according to the expression profiles of all SMGs and their relevant pathways. The two subtypes showed distinctively mutational patterns in NFE2L2, KEAP1, RASA1, CUL3 and COL11A1, and remarkably differential expressions of genes involved in multiple pathways like EMT, inflammatory response, and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways. These molecularly differential subtypes also showed significantly prognosis differences. Interestingly, the better survival subtype (C2) was observed to be with higher mutation frequencies considering NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 which may be onco-driver of LUSC (P\u00f6l\u00f6nen and Levonen; Kandoth et al.). This indicates although mutations of certain genes may contribute to the development of cancer, their mutations are not indicators of poor prognosis. This may also be related with the dual roles of NRF2 (Lau et al.; Gonzalez-Donquiles et al.). In any case, the prognostic differences between subtypes are determined by a series of factors but not only one simple condition like a SMG or over-expressed gene. Accordingly, a subtype predictor was trained and tested based on the expressional profiles of LUSC patients. Similar subtypes were also recognized in the other independent LUSC cohorts where patients with C1-like expressional profiles were also with worse survival rates.
