One example is the RCT and the observational study conducted by the Alcoholic Hepatitis Network (AlcHepNet) consortium sponsored by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and aiming to improve the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Briefly, participants are recruited into clinical studies at a clinical site, with clinical and behavioral information, treatment, responses, laboratory results, and clinical events collected at baseline and follow-up visits into REDCap and hosted at IU Clinical DCC. Meanwhile, biospecimens are collected at baseline and during follow-up visits as planned and distributed to translational labs to perform molecular tests or to generate multiomics data. Information about biospecimens as well as the generated data are sent to UMass Bioinformatics DCC. The data from the two DCCs are then merged into the AlcHepNet Data Warehouse for downstream data analysis. The REDCap-based AlcHepNet Data Model, which is specialized for the operation of clinical studies, is used for data capture and management. The ARDaC ETL and Harmonization tool is developed to bridge the gap between the AlcHepNet Data Model and the ARDaC CDM. Similarly, other NIAAA-funded clinical studies such as TREAT are ETL\u2019ed to the ARDaC CMD. The harmonized data are then stored in the ARDaC Data Warehouse and disseminated through the ARDaC research data commons. Table 1 summarizes the current data size of both the AlcHepNet Data Warehouse and the ARDaC Data Warehouse. As both the AlcHepNet clinical studies and the incorporation of previous clinical study data are ongoing, the ARDaC Data Warehouse is quickly growing.
