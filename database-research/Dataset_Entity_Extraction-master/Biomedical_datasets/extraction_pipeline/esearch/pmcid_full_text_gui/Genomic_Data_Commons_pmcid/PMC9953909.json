First, their strategy was based on the use of autologous DCs pulsed with tumor lysates, and we used allogenic DCs electrofused with living autologous tumor cells; second, in Liau et al.\u2019s study, patients were enrolled during first-line treatment, just after surgery and radiotherapy, and 64 patients crossed over to DC vaccination after recurrence (as opposed to our study, which included only recurrent cases); third, Liau et al.\u2019s patients were stratified according to MGMT status, and no IDH-status was presented. Since the most recent WHO classification from 2021, IDH-1 status gained relative importance over MGMT, and cases previously considered to be glioblastoma are now categorized as either glioblastoma (IDH-1 wild type) or astrocytoma grade 4 (IDH-1 mutated), two groups with very different survival rates. In our study, we stratified patients according to IDH-1 status and presented the survival curves from both subgroups separately. Due to these differences, we decided to directly compare the recurrent cases in Liau et al.\u2019s report with all high grade gliomas in our study: while their group had a survival of 13.2 months from relapse (CI95% 9.7 to 16.8), with a hazard ratio of 0.58 (0.00 to 0.76, p < 0.01), survival in our series was 16.6 months after relapse (95%CI 1.5 to 54.8, hazard ratio 0.45, 95%CI 0.32 to 0.64, p < 0.0001). These different results may be explained by demographic differences between study populations, different proportions of IDH-1 mutated cases in the two series, and differences between vaccines (allogenic vs. autologous DCs). Regardless of these differences, the low significant hazard ratios reported in the two prospective trials highlight the positive effect of DC vaccination in the natural course of high-grade gliomas.

To further our understanding of our patients\u2019 disease and recovery process, we are currently analyzing immune cell infiltrates within the tumors at the time of surgical resection and changes in circulating lymphocytes throughout the vaccination period. Initial observations suggest that PD1+-lymphocyte counts, or low B7-H4 expression levels, for instance, might represent a good prognostic factor for patients treated with DCs.

The first column of MRI scans (top panel, left) represents the patient\u2019s first MRI scan (top: flair sequence; bottom: T1 with gadolinium). The images seen in the second column were acquired following a first surgical resection in which roughly 50% of the tumor mass was removed. The first pathology exam revealed glioblastoma, IDH-1 wild type (according to the WHO classification from 2021). The patient then began chemotherapy with temozolomide, concomitant with 60 Gy radiotherapy fractioned into 30 sessions. Three months after the first surgery, the tumor had progressed, which led to a second surgical resection (indicated by scalpels in the figure). This resection was limited anteriorly when electrophysiological monitoring detected deteriorating motor evoked potentials on the right side of the body. The post-operative MRI showed remaining tumor tissue. At that time, the patient was already enrolled in the trial and received the first vaccination dose 3 months after the second surgery. In total, he received 7 doses at monthly intervals, as illustrated above, concomitant with 12 maintenance cycles of temozolomide, which finished 11 months after vaccination had begun (see bottom timeline). The patient underwent an MRI scan every two months to monitor tumor growth. The tumor remained stable throughout the vaccination period and thereafter. In functional terms, the patient is performing 100% according to the Karnofsky performance scale (completely asymptomatic) and 0 (zero) on the Ecog performance score. He has a mini-mental status score of 30, without any impairment in his daily living activities. He regularly takes two anticonvulsant agents, which are enough to control his epileptic seizures. To date, regular MRI scans have shown no tumor progression. He has not received any other chemotherapy treatment since discontinuation of temozolomide one year ago at the time of this report.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35823, "infons": {"file": "cancers-15-01239-g002.jpg", "id": "cancers-15-01239-f002", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves and respective 95% confidence intervals for vaccinated (blue) versus unvaccinated GDC bank (red) patients with glioblastoma (A) and those with grade 4 astrocytoma (B).
