Mitochondrial disorders may present with any symptom, in any organ, at any age and with any mode of inheritance. These often devastating disorders are clinically characterized by multi-system involvement with primarily progressive neurologic disease and myopathy, including both skeletal and cardiac muscle. The variability in clinical presentation and underlying causative mutations make the diagnosis very challenging, involving extensive clinical and specialized laboratory evaluation. However, no reliable diagnostic screening or biomarker is available that is both sensitive and specific in all cases of mitochondrial disorders. In current clinical practice, the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease relies heavily on identifying deficient activity of one or more of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, but in many cases the enzyme activity is found to be only moderately decreased or even normal, which makes the interpretation very difficult. Additionally, there are intrinsic problems in the biochemical characterization of mitochondrial disorders, such as variability in tissue manifestation, difficulty in establishing realistic normal reference ranges, inability of enzyme assays to detect some functional defects, variations in assay protocols, no uniform or standardized guidelines, and lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria and a quality assurance scheme. For these reasons, some patients may remain undiagnosed and even die of untreated disease. Early and definitive diagnosis is crucial for permitting appropriate management and accurate counseling. Thus, a new simplified and reliable approach for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders with better accuracy and precision has been strongly advocated.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4284, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Mitochondria are cellular organelles with numerous essential functions, such as production of energy, metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, and cofactors, and cell signaling. Their biogenesis and function is under the genetic control of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA. The number of mitochondrial proteins encoded by nuclear genes is estimated to be around 1,500, constituting 99% of mitochondrial proteins. mtDNA contains 37 genes encoding 13 respiratory chain subunits, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. Because of this dual genetic control, mitochondrial disorders can originate from mutations in either mtDNA or nuclear genes that encode the organelle proteins.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4951, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Mutations have been found in approximately 170 nuclear genes in patients with mitochondrial disorders. However, many nuclear genes causing disease are still unknown. It is expected that most mitochondrial disorders are caused by mutations in nuclear genes. The nuclear genes encode the subunits of the complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and relative assembly factors, proteins controlling the synthesis and stability of mtDNA, mitochondria transcription and translation, biogenesis, metabolism, and signaling. While substantial progress has been made in recent years in identifying nuclear genes that are mutated in mitochondrial disorders, the key clinical challenge lies in determining which one of hundreds of genes is responsible for the disease in any given patient. Comprehensive sequencing of all nuclear genes known to be involved in mitochondrial disease would be cost-prohibitive and time consuming using traditional DNA sequencing technology. Not surprisingly, clinical tests are available for only a limited number of nuclear genes for a few conditions in which the causative genes can be predicted by the clinical phenotypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6103, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Pathogenic mutations in mtDNA are found in at least one in 5,000 affected individuals and appear to be very common in the general population (>1 in 200 live births) even though these mutations show different penetrance during the lifetime of the carriers. Many of these mutations are primarily responsible for adult-onset mitochondrial disorders. Mutations in nuclear genes are likely the major cause of mitochondrial disease particularly in pediatric cases. Nevertheless, the pediatric prevalence of mtDNA mutations may have been underestimated because mtDNA testing is typically performed by targeted mutation analysis. This strategy cannot identify mutations beyond those targeted. While mtDNA (16,569 bp) could easily be sequenced by traditional Sanger methods, this technology is inadequate to detect some mtDNA mutations that occur in a small fraction of the total mtDNA molecules.

A limited number of novel variants were non-synonymous and all in the heterozygote state. Many of the same variants were also identified in unrelated samples from a human exome study that included 12 subjects (Table 3). The new variants were analyzed with PolyPhen, searched in Cardiff's Human Gene Mutation Database, aligned in search of homologous regions by BLAST and compared to orthologues with the Conserved Domain Database (Table 3). Only one variant was predicted as probably damaging. This was a cysteine to glycine substitution in the protein encoded by MTG1, a conserved protein required for assembly of the large ribosomal subunit. However, an alignment to orthologues showed that non-polar neutral residues can be substituted at this position. In particular, a glycine occupies this position, within a conserved region, in a ribosomal biogenesis GTPase from Mycoplasma pneumoniae [GenBank:NP_110345.1], indicating that the observed substitution may be tolerated. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to test the ability of the variant protein to rescue the respiratory deficient yeast mtg1 mutant, as this may be one of the as yet unidentified causative genes that are present in the population. A novel non-conservative substitution from asparagine to glycine was observed in the penultimate amino acid of Frataxin, a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial iron content mutated in one form of Frederich Ataxia (OMIM 229300). This was predicted as a possibly damaging variant. However, this position is not conserved between orthologues and is glycine in mouse, indicating that this terminal amino acid may not be functionally important. Two samples shared a conservative substitution from arginine to serine in Prolyl endopeptidase-like (PREPL), a novel oligopeptidase involved in hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome. This was predicted to be possibly damaging; however, in a search of orthologue proteins, a protease from Rickettsia conorii [GenBank:NP_360014] was shown to contain serine at the same position within a shared conserved motif. An arginine to glutamine substitution in the protein encoded by MRPS5, a member of the small mitochondrial ribosome subunit, was predicted to be possibly damaging. This position is conserved but not invariant in MRPS5 orthologues. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) presented a substitution at the donor splice site of intron 9 from the consensus GT to the non-canonical GC. Since GC is observed in some intron donor sites, it is hard to predict if this variant may affect splicing. A missense variant of the first codon of the beta subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADHB) could not be confirmed with traditional Sanger sequencing. This is an homozygote duplication of CTA in the first exon of the HADHB gene that we saw previously in normal samples ([GenBank:NM_000183.2] c.8_10dupCTA) and was also detected in. We then visually inspected the reads and were able to recognize that the variant was actually sequenced properly, while the artifactual variant had been called by MAQ. We believe these artifacts can be reduced with an improved recognition of indel variants using 76-bp reads and utilizing other analysis tools, such as 'cross-match', as exemplified in.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26382, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, both the HapMap individual and patient 2 are carriers for two identical mutations in recessive genes.

This specific variant was observed in one case with benign persistent hyperphenylananinemia, although not conclusively identified as pathogenic. This variant was also identified in normal samples in a human exome study that included 12 subjects, indicating that it is likely a polymorphism. While phenylketonuria is not a mitochondrial disorder, PAH was included in the list of candidate genes relying on an approach that uses shared evolutionary history to identify functionally related components of complex I. Additional variants were predicted to be benign.

Our criteria for identifying sites of potential heteroplasmy in the mitochondrial genome included >200\u00d7 coverage of the position with high-quality bases, and the observation of more than one allele at >5% frequency (that is, at least ten high-quality observations of the alternative allele). Six candidate heteroplasmic polymorphisms were identified in the three samples. However, after manual curation, variants in low complexity regions or regions with genome homology could not be confidently called. For example, one variant, m.4716C>A (AC_000021, Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence for mtDNA), was observed in all samples and accounted for 6%, 15% and 21% of the reads in the HapMap and patient 1 and 2 samples, respectively. This is a non-synonymous variant in the gene ND2, which encodes the NADH dehydrogenase 2 subunit of complex I. This C>A transversion would cause the missense mutation Gln83Lys in ND2, predicted to be probably damaging by PolyPhen. While it has been shown that heteroplasmic pathogenic mtDNA mutations are common in the general population, this is likely not a significant variation given the patient's clinical diagnosis. A likely explanation is that a highly homologous pseudogene on chromosome 1 ([GenBank:LOC100131754]; similar to NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) is also being captured to some extent, and incorrect mapping of some percentage of reads results in the observation of apparent heteroplasmy in all samples. By contrast, a heteroplasmic variant in which we had more confidence, m.16175A>G, was observed in the patient 2 sample, with approximately 50% of reads corresponding to each variant.

The current list of targeted genes includes 104 nuclear genes for which the causative mutations were previously found in various symptomatic patients, the entire mtDNA genome, and 258 additional nuclear genes potentially involved in mitochondrial disorders but that were never reported in patients due to either no attempts to sequence them or lack of clinically available testing (Table 1). The known/candidate genes include all of the structural components of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, as well as other mitochondrial proteins of the following functional groups: respiratory complex assembly factors, transcription and translation factors, enzymes, and carrier proteins. Some of the genes causing secondary inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are also included in this panel. One criterion for inclusion in the list of candidate genes was that members of each group had already been implicated in mitochondrial disease. Some candidate genes were recently reported as components of mitochondrial respiratory complexes by proteomics or identified as candidate genes by integrative genomics. Since we first compiled the list of putative genes, three were identified as causing mitochondrial disease in patients (C20orf7, CoQ9 and NDUFAF3 ).

Considering that the majority of pathogenic mutations are in coding regions or at intron-exon boundaries, we restricted capture and sequencing to these subsequences in genes of interest. The total target size is approximately 0.6 Mb for the exons of the 362 nuclear genes and 16.6 Kb for the entire mtDNA genome. This strategy allows circumventing the high costs of PCR and conventional sequencing for a large number of targets, while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity for detection of potentially pathogenic variants. Coverage of \u22658\u00d7 and a consensus quality score \u226520, which in our experience allows reliable variant calling, was observed for 96%, 94% and 94% of target bases in the nuclear genome in the HapMap, patient 1 and 2 samples, respectively. Normal and patient DNA samples with known pathogenic mutations were tested blindly. All known mutations in two different genes in the patients' DNA samples were identified correctly. The common mutation R263G in the X-linked gene PDHA1, which encodes a subunit of the Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, was identified in the patient 1 sample. The observed mutation in PDHA1 has been described in patients with Leigh syndrome, a condition characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity, since it can be due to mutations in several genes (OMIM 256000) and is thus a paradigm for the utility of the proposed assay. The mutations in the patient 2 sample affect HADHA, also called long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD). Patient 2 is a compound heterozygote of a novel mutation affecting the G nucleotide of the conserved splicing acceptor site at the 5' end of exon 5 and the common mutation E510Q. Several polymorphisms in mtDNA were identified and the depth of sequencing coverage was extremely high, indicating that it will be feasible to detect pathogenic mtDNA mutations in the presence of low level heteroplasmy undetectable with Sanger sequencing. While validation with a larger panel of positive controls for nuclear and mtDNA mutations is needed, this approach appears highly promising since approximately 95% of the targeted regions of 362 nuclear genes were sequenced and the results for known mutations were 100% concordant.
