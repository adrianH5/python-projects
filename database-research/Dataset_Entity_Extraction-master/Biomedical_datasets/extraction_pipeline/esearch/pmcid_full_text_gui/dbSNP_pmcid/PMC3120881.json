As the number of sequenced genomes continues to grow, a key question is: how does the quality of the assembled sequence affect the annotations? We compared the gene and SNP annotations for two different Bos taurus genome assemblies built from the same data but with significant improvements in the later assembly. The same annotation software was used for annotating both sequences. While some annotation differences are expected even between high-quality assemblies such as these, we found that a staggering 40% of the genes (>9,500) varied significantly between assemblies, due in part to the availability of new gene evidence but primarily to genome mis-assembly events and local sequence variations. For instance, although the later assembly is generally superior, 660 protein coding genes in the earlier assembly are entirely missing from the later genome's annotation, and approximately 3,600 (15%) of the genes have complex structural differences between the two assemblies. In addition, 12\u201320% of the predicted proteins in both assemblies have relatively large sequence differences when compared to their RefSeq models, and 6\u201315% of bovine dbSNP records are unrecoverable in the two assemblies. Our findings highlight the consequences of genome assembly quality on gene and SNP annotation and argue for continued improvements in any draft genome sequence. We also found that tracking a gene between different assemblies of the same genome is surprisingly difficult, due to the numerous changes, both small and large, that occur in some genes.

More than 350 eukaryotes have been sequenced and 400 more are planned (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/leuks.cgi). Most model organisms so far have been sequenced under the umbrella of large genome projects undertaken by large international consortia. A typical genome project produces a first draft of the genome, together with annotations and analyses. Subsequent releases then correct or alleviate assembly problems and update the auxiliary information. Thus, a genome project traditionally sets up a continuous effort to update these resources. New sequencing technologies have dramatically accelerated the pace at which new genomic sequences are being produced; they can now produce in less than one week the amount of data originally generated to sequence the human genome. The short reads produced by new sequencers, although a major challenge to assembly algorithms, have already become the standard due to their dramatically lower cost. Several large genomes have already been assembled from short reads or from a combination of short and traditional Sanger reads. Low cost, large sequencing capacity along with increasingly better assembly algorithms will soon make it possible for smaller groups, even individual investigators, to sequence and assemble their organisms of interest. Virtually all of these projects will produce \u201cdraft\u201d genomes, in which the chromosomes are assembled into a relatively large number of contiguous fragments (contigs) separated by gaps, and annotation software will then use these contigs, typically within groups of contigs with known order and gap sizes (scaffolds) or full chromosomes, as the substrate on which to identify protein-coding genes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3682, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Once a draft genome sequence is produced, the first and most crucial step in its analysis is finding the genes.

A significant complication arises when errors in the assembly interfere with the correct annotation, such as by deleting or scrambling the order of exons, or by altering a gene's sequence. (Note that unless otherwise specified, we use \u201cgenes\u201d to refer only to protein-coding genes.)

These freely available data allow scientists to search for common patterns of variation or for patterns associated with specific conditions. This collaborative model has since been adopted, albeit at a smaller scale, by many other genome sequencing projects. For instance, more than two million cattle SNPs have been collected in the dbSNP repository in GenBank, and the Bovine HapMap has recently reported a genome-wide characterization of >37,000 SNPs, which in turn has revealed patterns of variation associated with cattle domestication, selection and breed formation. Regardless of the species analyzed, collecting such information requires a tremendous effort that cannot be easily replicated.

UMD2 contains 2.61 billion bases (Gbp) in 30 chromosomes (1\u201329 and X) and 240 Mbp of unplaced sequence. UMD3, which was built using an improved algorithm and the identical input data, contains 2.64 Gbp in 30 chromosomes and 9 Mbp of unplaced sequence. Both assemblies underwent extensive post-processing to maximize the amount of sequence that was mapped to the chromosomes. Additional assembly steps improved the order and orientation of contigs using paired-end sequence information, marker mapping, and synteny with the human genome. By all measures, UMD3 is a higher quality assembly than UMD2, with fewer gaps, smaller gaps, longer contigs and scaffolds, and more chromosomal sequence ( Table 1 ). A major factor contributing to the improvements in UMD3 was more thorough filtering of contaminated reads and trimming of vector sequences, which allowed more overlapping reads to be assembled into contigs and more contigs into scaffolds, and which eliminated false joins that introduced errors in the assembly's order and orientation. The two genomes were deposited in GenBank upon release, and were annotated de novo using the NCBI eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline.

Local sequence errors can alter proximal sequence signals used by gene finders to predict genes, or can introduce frameshifting mutations, while contig inversions and translocations can lead to segmented and incomplete gene models.

To produce the annotations, cow mRNAs, ESTs and proteins as well as other known eukaryotic protein sequences available at the time (April 2009 for UMD2 and February 2010 for UMD3) in the RefSeq database were mapped to each of the two assemblies, and their partial alignments were merged to form basic gene models. These partial gene models were later used as restraints to the ab initio gene finding algorithm, which extended them without modifying the homology-supported portion of the gene. RefSeq mRNA alignments were chosen over the predicted models wherever available. Therefore, each transcript in the final annotation was at least partially supported by experimental evidence. Additionally, known human non-coding RNAs were mapped to each genome to produce non-coding gene models. While the two snapshots of RefSeq, taken almost a year apart, may themselves cause differences between the annotations and thus complicate the comparisons, the availability of two production-quality annotations generated with the same method is uniquely valuable as a comparison tool.
