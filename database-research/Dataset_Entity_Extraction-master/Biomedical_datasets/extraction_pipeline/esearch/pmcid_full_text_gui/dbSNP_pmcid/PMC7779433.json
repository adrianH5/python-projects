Mechanism of cancer dissemination, in general, is mediated by complex effects of promoting genes and suppressor genes (Iiizumi et al., 2007). KAI1 (CD82) is a well-known metastasis suppressor trans-membrane glycoprotein. KAI1 prevents metastasis by inhibiting cancer cells mobility and infiltration (Liu and Zhang, 2006). To achieve its function, KAI1 protein interacts with other cell membrane proteins such as adhesion proteins, growth factor receptor (GFR), and signaling pathways (Bienstock and Barrett, 2001; Bari et al., 2009). Different types of cancers showed KAI1 loss of expression especially those in advanced stages (Christgen et al., 2009; Malik et al., 2009a; Malik et al., 2009b; Malik et al., 2009c; Mooez et al., 2011; Shiwu et al., 2012; Scarpino et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). The mechanism behind down-regulation of KAI1 expression during cancer development is complex, mediated by transcription control, alternative splicing, and even post-translational remodeling (Tonoli and Barrett, 2005; Tsai et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2011). Only a few studies investigated gene mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or promoter hypermethylation as a cause of KAI1 down-regulation (Gao et al., 2003; Marreiros et al., 2003). One of the early studies revealed that neither mutation (on 10 prostatic cancer samples) nor allelic loss (on 34 prostatic cancer samples and 12 metastatic lymph nodes) is the cause of KAI1 gene down-regulation (Dong et al., 1995). A similar observation was made in another study (Miyazaki et al. 2000). Further studies also revealed that epigenetic changes such as methylation of promoter region is not essential to KAI1 loss of expression (Jackson et al., 2000; Sekita et al., 2001). A later report also showed that loss of KAI1 expression is not related to mutation, LOH, epigenetic regulation of the promoter, or p53 mutation (Uzawa et al., 2002). On the other hand, a study on 52 ovarian carcinomas found a missense alteration at codon 241 (ATC to GTC), which causes valine to isoleucine substitution in the peptide sequence but it occurs in normal tissues in addition to tumor cells (Liu et al., 2001). One more study discovered a significant correlation between a SNP on exons 3 (-29166 C>T) and the development of colorectal cancer of high grade and advanced stage (Ma et al., 2013).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4365, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To our knowledge, after a thorough literature review, no previous study was done on the relationship between the SNPs (selected in our study) and the expression level of KAI1.
