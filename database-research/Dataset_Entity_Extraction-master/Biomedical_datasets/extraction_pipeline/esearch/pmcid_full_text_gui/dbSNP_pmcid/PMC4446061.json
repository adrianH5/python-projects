Biological candidate genes in the region that have been previously studied include members of the guanylate binding protein (GBP) family. The five members of the GBP family that are located in the QTL region all represent potential candidate genes for the QTL effect. The GBP proteins work together in an interferon (IFN)-inducible complex to mediate a proinflammatory immune response to stimuli such as the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The GBPs can stimulate caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis, a specific form of apoptosis triggered by pathological stimuli such as contact with microbes, toxins or viruses. Both GBP2 and GBP3 have been associated with the ability to control pathogen replication but GBP3 is not assigned to the SSC4 QTL region.

PRRS virus is also a cofactor in other disease syndromes, such as porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) and porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD). Vaccination for protection against PRRSV infection has generally been unsuccessful, primarily due to the high degree of antigenic and genetic drift in viral structural and non-structural proteins and the capacity of the virus to subvert early innate immune responses. Genetics of the host has been well documented as another factor associated with susceptibility and response of the pig to PRRS.

The three SNPs that were not ASE appeared to be uninformative based on the lack of expression of an alternate allele in half of the AB animals in the PHGC5 dataset, which is supported by the multiple B QTL haplotypes identified in this population. There are many potential reasons for statistical evidence of ASE, including differences in regulatory factor binding, imprinting, DNA methylation, RNA splicing, RNA stability, RNA editing, and miRNA mediated silencing.

Concurrently, we identified the rs340943904 SNP in GBP5, for which the allele that was in perfect LD with the unfavorable A allele at the SSC4 QTL inserted five nucleotides into the GBP5 transcript upstream of exon 10. This insertion is expected to result in an early stop codon and thus a non-functional GBP5 protein. Since this SNP was predicted to change the splicing of GBP5, we used RNA-seq reads spanning the specific splice junctions to quantify the three alternatively spliced GBP5 transcripts across all time points. The wild-type splicing transcript was expressed more in individuals with the AB QTL genotype (p\u2009<\u20090.001), while the five nucleotide insertion transcript was more highly expressed in AA individuals (p\u2009<\u20090.001). No difference in expression was observed for the retained intron transcript between genotypes. Splicing consistent with these results was observed in a second population (Fig.\u00a02c). We validated the differential splicing results using quantitative capillary electrophoresis (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Interestingly, we could not detect the wild-type splicing transcript in AA individuals using this method. These results indicate that individuals with the AA QTL genotype produce almost no wild-type GBP5 transcript and an excess of the transcript that is expected to produce a non-functional protein. Thus, we predict that individuals with the AA QTL genotype produce very little functional GBP5 protein. None of the other 63 SNPs in LD identified in the QTL region (Additional files 12 and 13). The facts that AB QTL genotyped individuals produce significantly more wild-type splicing transcript than AA individuals, and that AA individuals produce almost no wild-type splicing GBP5, while producing large amounts of a non-functional transcript, are consistent with the observed dominance of the B QTL allele. It is unclear whether the differential expression of GBP5 completely depends on differential splicing, since the rs340943904 SNP is in perfect LD with the PRRS host response QTL.

Recent studies of the GBP5 knockout mouse indicate that GBP5 functions in host defense, inflammasome assembly, and inflammatory response. GBP5 serves as an important adaptor and mediator protein in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, deletion of the 67 C-terminal amino acids of GBP5 abolished the NLRP3 mediated inflammasome assembly and downstream immune response. Protein modeling was used to confirm that the structure of the C-terminus of GBP5 appears to be conserved across the human, mouse and pig (Additional file 16). The splice mutation described in this study results in severely reduced expression of wild-type GBP5 and a frameshift that leads to an early stop codon and truncation of the 88 C-terminal amino acids. These results indicate that pigs with the AA QTL genotype likely have very little to no GBP5 mediated NLRP3 inflammasome response to infection. Relatively little is known about the role of GBP5 in human or animal immune responses to viruses. One study indicates that GBP5 expression is upregulated during Epstien-Barr viral infection; however, the role of GBP5 in viral immune response is unknown.

First, RNA-seq analyses in two independent populations confirm that GBP5 was DE as a function of SSC4 QTL genotype. Second, all GBP5 SNPs in perfect LD with the SSC4 QTL exhibited ASE, with a shift towards higher expression of alleles that were in phase with the favorable B QTL allele.

Fourth, the rs340943904 SNP was validated to be in perfect LD with the SSC4 QTL in an independent genetic background. Fifth, the rs340943904 SNP introduced five nucleotides into exon 10 of the GBP5 transcript, which is predicted to shift the reading frame and result in an early stop codon that truncates the 88 C-terminal amino acids. Finally, almost no wild-type GBP5 transcript was produced in individuals with the AA QTL genotype.

LG, PS, JKL, IC and GSP conceived the globin reduction protocol and RNA-seq work and experimental design in the independent population. IC and SMA performed RNA isolation and globin reduction treatment. JEK, EF-W and JMR conducted the RNA-seq bioinformatics, CJE, NVLS, PL, and JCMD performed the RNA-seq statistical analysis. CJE, NVLS, JEK, EF-W, PL, and JCMD conducted the ASE processing and statistical analysis. JEK, EF-W and JMR identified the putative causal variant and determined the splicing mechanism in GBP5. JMR, JKL and IC conceived the AATI experiment, IC designed the primer set, IC and SMA prepared samples for AATI, and JEK and NVLS analyzed the data. SC identified the incorrect annotation of GBP5 and SC and HL provided sequence data used to correct the annotation of GBP5 and refine the differential splicing between exon 9 and 10. JEK performed the cross species analysis of GBP5 protein sequences. NJB, CJE, EF-W and JEK identified concordant variants with the QTL and managed the progress of experiments with NVLS, CKT, JMR, IC, JKL, SC, PL and JCMD. MS validated sample genotypes for AATI and tested the concordance of the GBP5 rs340943904 SNP with the rs80800372 SNP tracking the PRRS host response QTL in an independent population.
