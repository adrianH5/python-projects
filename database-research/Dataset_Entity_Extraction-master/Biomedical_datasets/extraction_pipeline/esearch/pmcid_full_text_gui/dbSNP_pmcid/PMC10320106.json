Its current version, DIANA-microT 2023 (www.microrna.gr/microt_webserver/), brings forward a significantly updated set of interactions. DIANA-microT-CDS has been executed utilizing annotation information from Ensembl v102, miRBase 22.1 and, for the first time, MirGeneDB 2.1, yielding more than 83 million interactions in human, mouse, rat, chicken, fly and worm species. Additionally, this version delivers predicted interactions of miRNAs encoded from 20 viruses against host transcripts from human, mouse and chicken species. Numerous resources have been interconnected into DIANA-microT, including DIANA-TarBase, plasmiR, HMDD, UCSC, dbSNP, ClinVar, as well as miRNA/gene abundance values for 369 distinct cell-lines/tissues.
