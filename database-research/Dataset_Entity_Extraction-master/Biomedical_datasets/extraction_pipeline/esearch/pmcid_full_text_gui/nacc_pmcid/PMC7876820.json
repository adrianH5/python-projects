In addition to being a major contributor to cardiovascular disease risk and mortality, hypertension has recently been established as a significant independent risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) dementia. Individuals with hypertension have been shown to exhibit poorer performance in multiple cognitive domains, including memory, psychomotor processing speed, attention, and executive function. Consequently, the relationships between the use of antihypertensive medications with dementia incidence and cognitive decline have become an important area of research. Some evidence has shown that reductions in cerebral blood flow associated with hypertension can be reversed through antihypertensive treatment, potentially mitigating cognitive and functional decline associated with AD. However, the results have been variable; while the SPRINT-MIND randomized clinical trial recently associated intensive blood pressure (BP) control with a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia, and several observational studies have associated the use of any antihypertensive agent with a reduced risk of incident dementia or cognitive decline, others have identified no significant benefits on one or both outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4339, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are first-line treatment options for hypertension which have similar indications and safety profiles. Mechanistically, they both act upon targets within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to elicit their blood pressure-lowering effects, with ARBs acting at the angiotensin II type-1 receptors (AT1Rs), and ACE-Is acting upstream at the angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1). Despite these similarities, a growing body of literature suggests that these antihypertensive classes may differ in their neuroprotective effects. Observational studies have found both ARBs and ACE-Is to be independently associated with reduced cognitive decline and incident dementia; in contrast, the literature in toto has been met with mixed conclusions, which may be due in part to heterogeneity in the study populations. Direct head-to-head comparisons of ARBs vs. ACE-Is have been limited, but studies have associated ARB use with less brain atrophy, lower dementia incidence, and slower cognitive decline relative to ACE-I use. In a previous pathology study, ARB use was associated with fewer plaques and tangles than ACE-I use, suggesting that these agents may act differently on AD pathological development and that therefore their effects might be examined specifically in the context of AD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5726, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This longitudinal study aimed to compare users of ACE-Is vs. ARBs with a diagnosis of AD dementia on memory and other cognitive outcomes over time.

These results in people with AD dementia agree with a recent analysis by Tully et al., who examined associations between antihypertensive drug use and cognitive decline in non-demented older adults. In that study, RAAS-targeting agents were associated with improved cognition relative to other antihypertensive drugs. Furthermore, those authors found that exposure to an ARB, but not to an ACE-I, was associated with better performance on a test of semantic verbal fluency and speed among APOE \u03b54 non-carriers. They found the opposite association among APOE \u03b54 carriers, whereby exposure to an ACE-I, but not to an ARB, was associated with better performance. Those findings are consistent with the present findings in AD patients that ARBs were associated with significantly better cognitive\u00a0performance over time\u00a0specifically in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31348, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present study identified associations between ARB use and performance on tests of memory, attention, verbal fluency\u00a0and psychomotor processing speed in people with AD dementia. In contrast, Tully et al. found no significant differences between ARBs and ACE-Is in memory or attention in older adults without dementia. Therefore, it is possible that these differences are specific to people with clinical symptoms of AD pathology. The magnitude of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative benefits associated with ARBs through inverse agonism at the AT1R and upregulation of AT2R and AT4R activity might be amplified in AD. Furthermore, studies\u00a0in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that ARBs can increase degradation and clearance of A\u03b2 peptides, though others in mouse models\u00a0have observed no differences. Moreover, a neuropathology study found that ARBs were associated with reduced A\u03b2 plaque load, and a cross-sectional PET study yielded similar results with PiB binding. It has been suggested that preservation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) function by ARBs, but not ACE-Is, may explain this difference, as ACE-1 has demonstrated a role in the prevention of A\u03b2 aggregation and fibril formation in vitro, although results from animal models have been highly variable.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32641, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The mechanistic reasons for the findings among \u03b54 non-carriers, but not among carriers, have yet to be explored. A recent study by Burnham et al. showed that APOE \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers did not differ in their rates of A\u03b2 accumulation once a certain threshold had been reached, but that APOE \u03b54 carriers arrived at that threshold, on average, 15\u2009years earlier than non-carriers. In the current analysis, the mean age of APOE \u03b54 non-carriers was significantly greater than APOE \u03b54 carriers (78.4\u2009years vs. 75.8\u2009years). Thus, the \u03b54 carriers in our analysis were likely at a more advanced stage of amyloid, tau, or AD progression in general, at which point the preservation of ACE-1 function, upregulation of ACE-2 function, or other purported anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms related to ARB use may lack benefit. Previous evidence has associated treatment of hypertension, regardless of antihypertensive agent, with an exponential decrease in incident AD dementia risk and cognitive decline particularly among hypertensive APOE \u03b54 carriers, but not non-carriers which might suggest that the magnitude of cognitive benefit among \u03b54 carriers afforded by general blood pressure-lowering effects is larger and that the importance of other mechanistic differences between ARBs and ACE-Is may be reduced relative to those observed in \u03b54 non-carriers. Notably, however, systolic BP was included as a time-varying covariate in all models, so the effects reported are independent of blood pressure-lowering effectiveness, which itself (i.e., systolic blood pressure over time) was not found to be a significant predictor of cognitive decline. Genetics may also play a role in explaining the heterogeneity of observed effects, as one study found that APOE \u03b54 carriers with specific ACE genotypes benefitted more from ACE-Is in reducing cognitive decline than did non-carriers; another study suggested that APOE and ACE genotypes may interact to confer risk of AD. As APOE \u03b54 carriers are likely to have more severe AD pathology, our results might suggest that the benefits of ARBs in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers could relate to effects on the cerebrovasculature that are less important in carriers. Recently, ARB use was associated with a reduced rate of amyloid accumulation in the cortex relative to ACE-I use, and this effect was also smaller in APOE \u03b54 carriers, which would be consistent, for example, with the possibility of a more profound and relevant deficit in vascular amyloid clearance with vascular brain aging\u00a0as a contributing cause of amyloidosis among APOE \u03b54 non-carriers who were older in this sample. Further work to understand disease heterogeneity is warranted. Future studies should explore ACE polymorphisms as additional heterogeneity factors, particularly to determine if ACE polymorphisms might interact with drug exposures among APOE \u03b54 carriers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35633, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Generally, BBB penetration was associated with preserved cognitive performance; however, this effect was more prominent for ACE-Is than ARBs. In most cognitive domains assessed, use of a non-crossing ACE-I was associated with the poorest performance. Previous findings around BBB penetrance have been equivocal. Consistent with our findings, Ho et al. reported better memory performance in users of BBB-crossing RAAS medications, and specifically among users of BBB-crossing ARBs relative to users of non-BBB-crossing RAAS medications. Tully et al. identified no significant associations between cognition and BBB penetration for either ACE-Is or ARBs, although marginally better scores were observed among users of centrally acting ARBs, consistent with the present study. For ACE-Is, previous work has associated the use of BBB-penetrating ACE-Is with reduced cognitive decline and dementia incidence relative to the use of non-BBB-crossing ACE-Is and to other antihypertensive drugs, both in an AD and in a\u00a0non-demented population. Our observations provide a context for those findings. The importance of BBB penetration in determining ACE-I effects on cognition is further supported by previous work in animal models which showed that administration of perindopril, a BBB-crossing ACE-I, increased acetylcholine levels in the brain, while non-BBB-crossing ACE-Is did not. The loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain is a defining characteristic of AD, and thus, this mechanism could underlie some of the cognitive benefits observed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37182, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our observation that there was no significant difference between BBB-crossing and non-crossing ARBs on memory and other cognitive domains might be explained by several factors. In a large epidemiological analysis of 819,941 older adults by Li et al., the\u00a0BBB-crossing ARBs candesartan and telmisartan were associated with significant dose-dependent reductions in dementia incidence; however, valsartan was not. An important limitation of our work is that a binary classification of ARBs and ACE-Is as BBB-crossing was made although these properties likely exist on a spectrum. Additionally, we acknowledge that there were some inconsistencies between the studies used to inform our classifications, and furthermore that data from animal models might not directly translate to the Alzheimer\u2019s disease population considered in the present analysis. For example, one study found that losartan crosses the BBB, while another did not. Although an absolute classification can be difficult to make, relative lipophilicity can be determined with greater certainty, for example, telmisartan was found at 10-fold higher concentrations than losartan in a rodent study. Although telmisartan, candesartan, and valsartan are all considered to be BBB-crossing, many studies have suggested that telmisartan and candesartan specifically may offer disproportionate neuroprotective benefits via several potential mechanisms. Sequential studies of ARBs administered peripherally in rats to counter centrally administered angiotensin II identified these two agents as being the most brain-penetrating of all ARBs, and evidence from humans and non-human\u00a0primates reinforces the BBB-crossing properties of telmisartan. Valsartan is more commonly prescribed and constituted the majority of the BBB-crossing ARBs in our analyses; therefore, sample size precluded subgroup analyses of more highly lipophilic ARBs (i.e., telmisartan and candesartan). The present findings generally support the idea that BBB penetration, coupled with other drug-specific properties, might predict neuroprotective properties of ARBs, in addition to ACE-Is. Notably, there were no differences between crossing and non-crossing agents among \u03b54 carriers, although trends in the same direction remained. While there are multiple possible reasons for this, APOE \u03b54 has been associated with breakdown and increased permeability of the BBB, so it is possible that any additional\u00a0benefits conferred by ARBs or ACE-Is that depend on their brain-penetrating properties are nullified in this group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39737, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39749, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Strengths of the present work include a relatively large sample size, adjustment for confounding by indication through inverse probability of treatment weighting, and the selection of a homogeneous group of participants with AD dementia. We also acknowledge several limitations. Diagnoses were based primarily upon clinical criteria rather than biomarker and imaging data. Analyses could not be adjusted for drug dosage and drug adherence, because this information was not available in the NACC database. This might be important given evidence from Li et al. which suggested a dose-dependent effect of ARBs whereby higher doses were associated with lower dementia incidence. Duration of drug exposure prior to entry into the NACC cohort was not available. Similarly, duration of hypertension and other vascular comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypercholesterolemia) were not available. Partially due to phasing out of the WMS-R LM IIA between UDS 2.0 and UDS 3.0, there was a high rate of loss to follow-up, such that fewer than half of all participants included in the analyses had more than one observation for the outcome of delayed recall; however, loss to follow-up was similar between exposure groups. It should be acknowledged that sampling bias might limit generalizability as participants enrolling into ADC cohorts typically have a higher level of education and socioeconomic status than the general population. Although we implemented inverse probability of treatment weighting to address potential confounding by indication, chronic kidney disease is a factor that may influence the prescription of ACE-Is vs. ARBs, but data on this diagnosis were not available. The findings do not provide mechanistic insight; further studies might examine biomarker data, including A\u03b2 and tau, in addition to expression of RAAS components, such as ACE-1, ACE-2, and Mas, AT2R, AT4R, and other receptors in the regulatory arm of the pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41688, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41699, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This longitudinal analysis of participants with a diagnosis of AD dementia revealed that ARB exposure was associated with favorable cognitive outcomes relative to ACE-I exposure.

BBB penetration was identified as a significant moderator of the effects of ACE-Is, but not ARBs. The results consolidate previous findings. Further prospective studies should investigate the mechanisms by which ARBs may exert neuroprotective properties that may be beneficial against AD, in addition to how patient-level (e.g. genomic) factors might contribute to heterogeneity in drug response.
