A typical subgroup (n = 926) was defined as having a difference in language and memory performance of <1 SD. Compared with the memory subgroup, the language subgroup was 3.7 years older and more frequently self-identified as African American (OR = 3.69). Under a dominant genetic model, the language subgroup had smaller odds of carrying at least one APOE\u03b54 allele relative to the memory subgroup. While this difference was present for all ages, it was more striking at a younger age (OR = 0.19 for youngest tertile; OR = 0.52 for oldest tertile).

After adjusting for covariates, the OR for being an APOE\u03b54 carrier in the language subgroup relative to the memory subgroup for age <74.1 (youngest tertile) was nearly a third the OR for age >80.7 (oldest tertile). Similarly, the OR for being an APOE\u03b54 carrier in the typical subgroup relative to the memory subgroup for age <74.1 (youngest tertile) was less than half the OR for age >80.7 (oldest tertile). These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that the effect of APOE\u03b54 on memory and language function was more pronounced in early-onset AD compared with late-onset AD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25351, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "After controlling for covariates, the language subgroup was less cognitively impaired on the MMSE at baseline compared with the memory subgroup, though with a small effect size (0.7 MMSE points). While this might suggest that the memory subgroup was later in their disease course, this is unlikely the case. When we compared a global cognition composite score based on all UDS neuropsychological tests, the language subgroup was no longer less impaired than the memory subgroup (data not shown). Further, there was no baseline difference between the subgroups on CDR sum of boxes or on the FAQ after controlling for covariates. More likely, the difference between the language and memory subgroups on the MMSE at baseline is due to intrinsic properties of the MMSE. Specifically, the MMSE language items are less sensitive for early dementia and have lower correlation with performance on neuropsychological testing compared with the MMSE memory item.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26303, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "After controlling for covariates, compared with the memory subgroup, the language subgroup demonstrated a faster rise in functional impairment on both the FAQ and the CDR. On average, members of the language subgroup would take about 5 years to undergo a similar amount of cognitive decline as members of the memory subgroup would undergo in 7 years. The rate of rise for the typical subgroup fell between that of the memory and language subgroups. If the slope for the typical subgroup represents the typical rate of functional decline in AD, then our data suggests that an atypical memory variant will have slower than typical decline while an atypical language variant will have faster than typical decline. An analysis of rate of functional decline in a language subgroup of AD has not been performed previously. Age, APOE\u03b54 status, race, and years of education have all been implicated in the rate of decline in AD. Differences in rate of decline between the language and memory subgroups persisted despite including these covariates, suggesting that these two groups differ not only in the cognitive phenotype, but in aspects of disease course as well.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27468, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A possible weakness of the study was that participant demographics and clinical criteria may have lacked uniformity given the heterogeneity of the 34 ADCs contributing to the NACC database.
