Herein, we refer to the standard covariate\u2010adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and the MSC model with IPW as the standard Cox model and IP\u2010weighted MSC model, respectively. IPW is a technique commonly used in survey sampling to adjust for sample selection bias and the potential confounding effects of both time\u2010varying and baseline covariates. As such, the method creates a so\u2010called pseudo\u2010population in which (1) the exposure is independent of the measured covariates and (2) drop\u2010out is not related to the measured exposure and covariates and thus, potential selection bias due to loss to follow\u2010up is accounted for. As a result, unlike the standard Cox model, the IP\u2010weighted MSC model allows for the estimation of the hazard ratio that can be interpreted, under certain assumptions (i.e., well\u2010defined exposures, the absence of unmeasured confounding, correct model specification, and positivity), in the same way as the hazard ratio is obtained in a RCT, in which no confounding and no loss to follow\u2010up are observed.

The results suggested no meaningful departure from proportional hazards (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05). To account for events that occurred on the same date, we used Efron's approximation, which was previously shown to perform well in the presence of ties. The standard Cox model was adjusted for the baseline values of covariates including age, sex, years of education, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, years smoked, alcohol dependence, stroke, heart attack/cardiac arrest, body mass index (BMI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score, and hearing aid status (Scenario 1). BMI was categorized as underweight\u00a0(<20.0\u00a0kg/m2), normal (\u226520.0\u00a0 and\u00a0<27.5\u00a0kg/m2), or overweight (\u226527.5\u00a0kg/m2), based on the suggestion that higher cut\u2010off points may be more appropriate for older adults. GDS scores were categorized as no depression\u00a0(<5) and depression (\u22655). For the IP\u2010weighted MSC model, we first calculated the exposure weights, based on the inverse of each participant's probability of the exposure, given the values of baseline (age at baseline, sex, years of education, and years smoked) and time\u2010varying covariates (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol dependence, stroke, heart attack/cardiac arrest, BMI, GDS score, and hearing aid status in Scenario 1). To test for potential non\u2010linear dependence in the data, we compared the model with only a linear term against the model with linear and cubic spline terms using a likelihood ratio test. The linearity assumption was satisfied for all continuous variables. Because some participants were lost to follow\u2010up throughout the study period, we also included censoring weights in the estimation process to account for selection bias due to loss to follow\u2010up. To increase statistical efficiency, the weights were stabilized. Next, the IP\u2010weighted MSC model was fitted by weighting participants according to their estimated exposure and censoring weights, with outcome time to incident MCI, and the hearing impairment or hearing aid status as the sole covariate.

Given that use of hearing aids may help mitigate cognitive decline, hearing aid usage should be incorporated as a confounding factor when analyzing changes in cognitive function. Alternatively, the impact of hearing loss on cognition should be assessed by comparing participants with normal hearing and participants with hearing loss not using hearing aids. As such, Amieva et\u00a0al. found a significant difference in the rate of change in cognitive scores between hearing\u2010impaired individuals not using hearing aids and controls while indicating no difference in cognitive decline between subjects with hearing loss using hearing aids and controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38130, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The potential beneficial treatment effect of hearing aids on cognitive decline observed in our study is consistent with conclusions of previous work. In a prospective interventional study involving 34 elderly participants with hearing loss, cognitive function was significantly improved after 3 months of hearing aid use. Sarant et\u00a0al. showed that treatment of hearing loss led to improvements in cognition and self\u2010reported listening disability after 18 months of hearing aid use, with >97% of participants reporting significant improvements in executive function. Hearing aid use was also associated with lower risk of incident dementia in individuals with MCI. The percentage of participants who had not developed dementia 5 years after the baseline MCI diagnosis was shown to be significantly higher for users (33%) than non\u2010users of hearing aids (19%).

Although this may not be a limitation, as indicated in Oosterloo et\u00a0al., discrepancies between self\u2010reported hearing and audiometric assessment have been observed in other previous work. Further reported difficulties with using self\u2010report to estimate prevalence of hearing loss include people with similar hearing deficits reporting less disability and handicap as their age increases. Due to unavailability of data, we were unable to examine the impact of the degree of hearing impairment and measurement of how often hearing aids were used, or whether they were appropriately fitted, on the observed associations. In addition, given that hearing aid users wait an average of 7 to 10 years to seek help for hearing loss, some of the study participants that reported functionally normal hearing when using hearing aids might have had limited awareness of what functionally normal hearing is by the time they began to use hearing aids.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40148, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although ADRC staff were trained and instructed to report on whether they felt participants\u2019 ability to answer the CDR\u2010SB questions was impacted by their hearing loss, there is a risk that hearing loss may have confounded cognition results for some participants.

Participants who chose to use hearing aids may have differed from those who did not by factors including higher socioeconomic status and education. Therefore, compared to an RCT in which exposure is randomly assigned, the characteristics of participants in our study were unbalanced between exposed and unexposed groups. To address the bias, due to non\u2010randomized exposure allocation, potential confounding effects of both time\u2010varying and baseline covariates and selection bias due to drop out, we implemented the IPW approach to fit the MSC model. The IP weighting allowed us to assign exposure/treatment independently of the counterfactual responses and conditional on observed covariates and calculate statistics standardized to a pseudo\u2010population in which the exposure was independent of the measured confounders. Although the implementation of the IPW\u2010adjusted MSC models accounted for a large set of measured covariates, selected based on evidence from previous work, there is still a chance that our study may include unmeasured confounding factors that were unintentionally omitted from the analysis. These unmeasured confounders could possibly bias causal inferences in our analysis. To account for the impact of potential unmeasured confounding bias on the associations, we performed the sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding.
