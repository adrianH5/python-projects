Differences in the proportion of patients in the earlier and more advanced stages of dementia with no or sparse plaques could be related to subsequent plaque deposition in the advanced stages of AD, slower clinical progression (such that fewer individuals reached the advanced dementia stages in their lifetime), or other factors. Regardless, current clinical trials using either soluble or fibrillar A\u03b2-modifying treatments seem unlikely to benefit participants in this situation, even if they are shown to be effective in A\u03b2 positive individuals. Development of new treatment strategies will be required to accommodate this pathologic heterogeneity within the clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD dementia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21375, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, APOE4 carriers with higher plaque densities were statistically significantly younger than APOE4 carriers with lower plaque densities at the time of death.

There are also limitations to our study. First, there are potential differences in staining protocols across the ADCs. Some of the autopsies were performed using silver staining methods, thioflavin T, or Congo red, which may be less sensitive methods for detecting diffuse A\u03b2 plaques than immunohistochemistry. Unfortunately, the staining method or methods used are not available in the NACC neuropathology database, so we were unable to account for this protocol variation. We did, however, re-examine tissue from multiple sites with standardized immunohistochemical methods for A\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau and found considerably good agreement in identifying the presence of amyloid.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23552, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, there was some missing data. 162 MMSE scores were indicated as missing due to a cause other than cognitive impairment; however, it is possible that this group of participants did, in some way, affect the study sample.

These findings suggest that a non-amyloidogenic variant resembling the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s disease may be more common than previously expected among research participants with mild-to-moderate AD dementia, particularly in APOE4 non-carriers, and they provide additional evidence to suggest that these individuals may not respond to treatments that target either fibrillar or soluble A\u03b2.
