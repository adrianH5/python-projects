They typically assign a common set of weights to the individual energy terms that contribute to the overall energy score, however, these weights should be gene family-dependent. In addition, they incorrectly assume that individual interactions contribute towards the total binding affinity in an additive manner. In reality, noncovalent interactions often depend on one another in a nonlinear manner. In this paper we show how the use of support vector machines (SVMs), trained by associating sets of individual energy terms retrieved from molecular docking with the known binding affinity of each compound from high-throughput screening experiments, can be used to improve the correlation between known binding affinities and those predicted by the docking program eHiTS. We construct two prediction models; a regression model trained using IC50 values from BindingDB, and a classification model trained using active and decoy compounds from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). Moreover, to address the issue of overrepresentation of negative data in high-throughput screening data sets, we have designed a multiple-planar SVM training procedure for the classification model. The increased performance that both SVMs give when compared with the original eHiTS scoring function highlights the potential for using nonlinear methods when deriving overall energy scores from their individual components. We apply the above methodology to train a new scoring function for direct inhibitors of M.tuberculosis (M.tb) InhA. By combining ligand binding site comparison with the new scoring function, we propose that phosphodiesterase inhibitors can potentially be repurposed to target M.tb InhA.

Typically, docking algorithms consist of both a search algorithm for the exploration of different ligand (and sometimes protein) conformations, and a scoring function for the calculation of ligand binding affinities. Ideally, the scoring function should be able to identify a solution with the correct ligand binding mode from alternative solutions, and ultimately be able to rank a set of ligands according to experimental binding affinity. In principle, the binding affinity should be calculated based on the first principle of thermodynamics. The most powerful approach is the absolute binding free energy (ABFE) approach, which uses extensive conformational sampling from molecular dynamics simulation, fully detailed atomic force fields, and a separate simulation of the solvation of the ligand, protein and associated complex. However, ABFE is too computationally expensive to be applied to screen millions of compounds. Furthermore, in spite of its cost, the prediction from ABFE is not always accurate. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop physical-based or knowledge-based docking scoring functions to efficiently predict binding affinity. However, docking scoring functions remain notoriously weak predictors of binding affinity. Indeed, following an evaluation of 10 docking programs and 37 scoring functions, Warren et al. concluded that scoring functions are in need of significant improvements for predicting binding affinity. The principal reason for failure is the inability of the scoring function to reliably rank optimal \u2018native-like\u2019 ligand conformations above \u2018non-native\u2019 orientations. Thus, although in most cases the correct binding mode can be retrieved during the conformational search, assigning the lowest energy score to the correct binding pose has proved to be more challenging. This inevitably leads to poor correlation with experimentally determined binding affinities. In general, the prediction of binding affinity is a challenging task since it is not only the result of collective weak noncovalent interactions, but it also includes the ability of the ligand to access the binding site, the desolvation free energy of the ligand and the binding site, and entropy and enthalpy changes in the ligand, protein, and solvent.

In order to achieve more accurate results, the docking score must be trained to derive a unique set of weights for each individual family. Furthermore, many docking algorithms incorrectly assume that individual interactions contribute towards the total binding affinity in an additive manner, and therefore derive their predictions of binding affinity from a linear combination of individual energy terms. However, this method is not theoretically sound, since it fails to consider the cooperative effects of noncovalent interactions. Such cooperativity has only been considered recently.

While Deng et al. trained Kernel a PLS (partial least squares) to predict protein-ligand binding affinity, Ballester and Mitchell trained a random forest classifier for the same purpose. The algorithm by Ballester and Mitchell (\u2018RF-Score\u2019) was shown to outperform 16 existing scoring functions when using a benchmark consisting of 195 diverse protein-ligand complexes. In 2005, Springer et al. presented PostDOCK, a post-processing filter to distinguish true binding protein-ligand complexes from docking artefacts generated by the popular docking program DOCK 4.0.1. PostDOCK uses biochemical descriptors to characterize the protein-ligand interaction, including nonbonded van der Waals and electrostatic interaction force field terms from the DOCK score, terms for hydrogen bonding, metal bonding, lipophilicity, and a series of buried solvent accessible surface area descriptors. The authors used a random forest classifier to separate the binding and the nonbinding ligands from a test set of 44 structurally diverse protein targets, and showed that PostDOCK was able to outperform both the DOCK and ChemScore scoring functions. More recently, Sato et al. developed Pharm-IF, a novel atom-based, pharmacophore-based interaction fingerprint.

Hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions and hydrophobic interactions are considered. Four machine learning algorithms (na\u00efve Bayesian classifier, random forest, support vector machine and artificial neural network) were used to build prediction models based on Pharm-IF, and each was shown to outperform the GLIDE docking algorithm across all five targets investigated. Durrant and McCammon also recently demonstrated that neural networks can be used to successfully characterize the binding affinities of protein-ligand complexes. Their neural networks, which were trained by characterizing 4,141 protein-ligand complexes across 194 dimensions, were used to rescore the docked poses of a selected set of ligands.

It occurs when one of the classes in the dataset, commonly the class of interest, is represented by a significantly smaller number of samples than the other class(es). For instance, of the tens of thousands of compounds typically investigated in HTS, it is likely that only a small fraction will show activity against the target of interest. As a result, HTS data are commonly imbalanced, with the vast majority of compounds belonging to the negative class.

Indeed, since only SVs are important for SVM model classification, the removal of non-SV samples has no significant effect on model performance. In this way, the granular sampling method identifies samples that are adjacent to the border between the two classes, and uses them to draw the separating hyperplane. Those samples that are far away from the hyperplane are discarded during model building.

The prediction is based on the combined score of the n SVM models (Figure 1). Compared to the granular sampling method, the multiple planar method is more computationally efficient. Indeed, the main drawback of the granular sampling method is that it is not possible to extract all informative negative samples using a single SVM. For instance, in the aforementioned work of Li et al., 67 sampling rounds, each involving the modelling of a new SVM, were required before the results converged and the sampling process was considered complete.

Unfortunately, docking scoring functions, which are primarily designed for high throughput analyses, tend to ignore this fundamental concept of cooperativity in favour of the simpler and more convenient additivity approach. A number of recent studies have highlighted the need for docking scoring functions that incorporate descriptors that model cooperative effects. In particular, Muley et al. suggested that the potential error in binding affinity predictions resulting from ignoring the cooperativity between a hydrogen bond and a hydrophobic side chain of 100 \u00c52 contact surface could be in the region of one order of magnitude. It is noted that cooperativity in protein-ligand interactions appears at the atomic level.

The two models gave a good consensus. Our results based on y-randomization indicate that the improved ranking performance is not due to over-fitting, and that our model may capture new information that is missed by the eHiTs docking scoring function, which is considered to be the state-of-the-art, but incorrectly assumes that individual interactions contribute towards the total binding affinity in an additive manner. The purpose of our new model is to capture the non-linear cooperative features of noncovalent interactions. Although there is still room for improvement as far as our methodology is concerned, i.e., the fact that the features in our model do not explicitly capture the atomic details of protein-ligand interactions, we hope that our work may inspire future endeavors in developing new scoring functions that correctly model the cooperative effects of protein-ligand interactions.
