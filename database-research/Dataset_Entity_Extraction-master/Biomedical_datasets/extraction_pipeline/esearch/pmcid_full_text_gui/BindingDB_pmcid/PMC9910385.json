Although a potential beneficial effect in the retina might be attributed to hypoglycemic effects of glyburide, our study suggests a favorable effect of glyburide in the pathogenesis of DR. This favorable localized effect was also suggested by Berdugo et al., who explored the effects of oral and intravitreal glyburide at a non-hypoglycemic dose in animal models of DR and reported reduced DR in treatment groups.

To properly function as transcription factors, RUNX factors require the formation of a heterodimer with core binding factor \u03b2 (CBF\u03b2) (Table 3), which is ubiquitously expressed in RUNX-expressing cells. In our study, proteins that were upregulated in DR converge in the RUNX2 pathway activation, which is supported by a recent study that reported RUNX2 upregulation in DR and its role in the breakdown of the blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB). It is noteworthy to mention that previous studies looking at the RUNX2 pathway have reported a downregulation of the RUNX2 pathway in diabetes; however these studies primarily focused on bone formation, osteogenesis, and regulation of bone development, whereas our study identified upregulation of RUNX2 in myeloid cell differentiation. Myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages) are an important component in the pathology of DR, where changes in the myeloid cell compartment have been reported to be altered in diabetes.

Despite its heterogeneous function as an angiogenic factor, LGALS3 requires cleavage by MMP to promote angiogenesis. Our bioinformatics approach identified the upregulation of MMP-13 (LGALS3 is a substrate for MMP-13) and the metallothioneins pathway (important in the expression of metalloproteinases), providing not only upregulation of an angiogenic factor (LGALS3) but also a means for activating its angiogenic properties (Tables 2,\u00a03).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35083, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Furthermore, capillary nonperfusion and ischemic events underlie the progression of DR into PDR which is driven by hypoxia and the production of factors that promote neovascularization.

Disruption to the BRB has been associated with MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14, and neovascularization has been associated with MMP-2 and MMP-9. A study looking into changes in the vasculature microenvironment found that, after 3 days of ischemia, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 levels were elevated in diabetic mice compared to non-diabetics. However, elevated levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 did not increase collagenolysis and vascular remodeling, pointing toward MMP-13 contributing to DR through other means. A different study demonstrated that elevated levels of MMP-13 and inflammatory markers in human monocytes were associated with hyperglycemic conditions, suggesting that MMP-13 might contribute to DR through its action in myeloid cells. This notion is supported by the known association of activated monocytes with progression of DR into PDR, the degradation of the BRB, and our findings of upregulation of RUNX2 in myeloid cells. In addition, LGALS3 has been associated with O-glycosylation in corneal epithelial cells and in the maturation of cancers, including vascularization and metastasis.

Finally, despite the fact that our proteomics and genomics data are from populations with limited ethnic diversity, the association of ethnic genetic constructs with DR development and progression is unclear.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39756, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study is a theoretical venture and the candidate drugs identified by its approach must be validated in experimental studies. The outcomes of the pipeline we suggest depend on when the search is run. The REACTOME and other pathway databases such as PANTHER and KEGG are a consortium of various public academic institutions that gradually and manually review, curate, and include newly found pathways in the database. As new pathways are being discovered they will be included in the database with a lag. Thus, the pathways observed in our study are reflective of the status of the REACTOME database at the time of our analysis, which is expected to be updated in future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40430, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We analyzed proteomics and genomics information from two diverse population with extended analyses to include a drug discovery arm. Each step of the pipeline provided input for the subsequent dataset, eventually converging at a shared target that can in theory be potentially modified with available drugs. Doing so, our approach can accelerate drug discovery and significantly reduce the costs of finding new therapeutics. In particular, identifying already FDA-approved drugs largely expedites their application for bedside treatment. Previous studies (mostly in the field of cancer medicine) have applied this tool in isolation or missed the connection between genomics and proteomics data and drug discovery search engines. It is clear that the application of our bioinformatics pipeline extends beyond DR and ocular diseases and can be implemented in a wide range of medical fields. In short, the approach used in this pipeline is robust, and the method of finding approved drugs to be repurposed for new indications is sound and efficient. Our approach stands to bridge the bench-to-bedside gap that is often a rate-limiting step in developing novel treatments for the management of DR after their efficacy has been further validated in preclinical and clinical studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41707, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material",
