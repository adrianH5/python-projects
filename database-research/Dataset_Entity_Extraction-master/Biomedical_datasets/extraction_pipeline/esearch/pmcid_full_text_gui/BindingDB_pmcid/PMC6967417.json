Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) can significantly facilitate the drug discovery process. Compared to the costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming experimental methods, machine learning (ML) plays an ever-increasingly important role in effective, efficient and high-throughput identification of DTIs. However, upstream feature extraction methods require tremendous human resources and expert insights, which limits the application of ML approaches. Inspired by the unsupervised representation learning methods like Word2vec, we here proposed SPVec, a novel way to automatically represent raw data such as SMILES strings and protein sequences into continuous, information-rich and lower-dimensional vectors, so as to avoid the sparseness and bit collisions from the cumbersomely manually extracted features. Visualization of SPVec nicely illustrated that the similar compounds or proteins occupy similar vector space, which indicated that SPVec not only encodes compound substructures or protein sequences efficiently, but also implicitly reveals some important biophysical and biochemical patterns. Compared with manually-designed features like MACCS fingerprints and amino acid composition (AAC), SPVec showed better performance with several state-of-art machine learning classifiers such as Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Random Forest and Deep Neural Network on BindingDB. The performance and robustness of SPVec were also confirmed on independent test sets obtained from DrugBank database. Also, based on the whole DrugBank dataset, we predicted the possibilities of all unlabeled DTIs, where two of the top five predicted novel DTIs were supported by external evidences.

Generally, drugs have interactions with specific molecular targets, which are known as drug-target interactions (DTIs). Accurate identification of DTIs can significantly facilitate the processes of drug discovery. Thus, modern drug development calls for more effective and efficient techniques to identify true DTIs from the vast libraries of chemical compounds and protein targets. Numerous efforts have been poured into predictions of DTIs. However, it is still challenging to identify new drugs and their corresponding targets because of the limited knowledge about complex relationships between chemical space and proteomics space. Since in vivo and in vitro testings are rather costly and time-consuming (Kuruvilla et al.,; Haggarty et al.,; Valentin et al.,), scientists' focus moves more than ever to in silico techniques predict potential drug-target associations on a large scale, in which machine learning (ML) is one of the most attractive approaches.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3093, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Various machine learning methods have been developed in the last decades, in which the most widely used models are binary classifiers like Random Forest (RF) (Ho,), Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik,), Deep Neural Network (DNN) (Liu et al.,), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) (Friedman,), and so on. The performance of machine learning methods relies heavily on data representation (or features). Therefore, the design of data preprocessing and data transformation is of great concern to ensure that the data representation can support efficient machine learning algorithms. Numeric methods have been proposed to excavate drug and target features from their chemical structures and genomic sequences, respectively, such as fingerprints (Morgan,; Ewing et al.,) and other molecular descriptors (Van Aalten et al.,; Hong et al.,) for drugs, amino acid composition (AAC) (Nakashima and Nishikawa,) and physico-chemical properties (Cai et al.,) of target proteins, and so on. For example, Nascimento et al. used \u201cnormalized Smith-Waterman, mismatch and spectrum kernels\u201d for the target protein sequences and \u201cthe spectrum, Lambda-k, Marginalized, MinMax, and Tanimoto kernels\u201d for the drug's chemical structure to predict DTIs. In the work by Nanni et al., the drugs were represented by FP2 fingerprints and the representations on the targets were based on autocovariance, entropy, discrete wavelet, and substitution, and so on. The representation of the drug-target pairs was done by concatenating the target descriptors with the FP2 fingerprints of the drug. In the works by He et al., multiple chemical functional groups for drug-related features and pseudo AAC for protein-related features were extracted to describe drug-target pairs. Chen et al. integrated protein-protein similarity network, drug-drug similarity network, and known drug-target interaction networks into a heterogeneous network, and then implemented the random walk algorithm on this heterogeneous network for the prediction of DTIs. Rayhan et al. exploited their algorithms using both structural and evolutionary information to generate informative features. Based on these traditional features, the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictions of DTIs have been gradually improved to a quite high level. However, these feature extraction methods require tremendous manpower and expert insights, and the effectiveness of these features also requires tremendous computations to be proved. Tedious processes of \u201cfeature engineering\u201d have to be done before these features can be fed into downstream ML models.

An RL algorithm attempts to discover the latent features that describe the structure of a dataset under certain (either explicit or implicit) assumptions. Nowadays, RL has shown an influential role in effectively extracting features and solving the problem in computer vision, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) (Mikolov et al.,; Sharif Razavian et al.,). RL aims to automatically learn the representations (or features) from raw data that can be effectively utilized by downstream machine learning models to improve the performance of the model. Word2vec (Mikolov et al.,) is one of the most popular RL methods, making NLP problems easier to tackle. Inspired by the distributed hypotheses that words found in similar environments usually have similar meanings, the Word2vec model predicts the center word based on its neighbor words in the window of a given size. This method simultaneously learn several language concepts such as Collobert and Weston: (1) the meaning of the word; (2) how words are combined to form a concept (i.e., grammar); (3) how a concept relates to the task. Word2vec effectively removes word-meaning extraction subtasks by providing pre-trained word embeddings for learning algorithms. The word representations computed using Word2vec are very interesting because the learned vectors explicitly encode many linguistic regularities and patterns. Somewhat surprisingly, many of these patterns can be represented as linear translations. For example, the vector of \u201cParis\u201d minus the vector of \u201cFrance\u201d plus the vector of \u201cItaly\u201d is very close to \u201cRome.\u201d In addition to its original utility as a word-embedding method, some of its ideas are effective in sequential data of non-language tasks (Jaeger et al.,; Zhang et al.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7906, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, RL brought several breakthroughs in compound space and protein space. Convolutional neural networks were successfully applied on molecular graphs (Kearnes et al.,; Coley et al.,) and depictions of molecules (Goh et al.,). Latent semantic structure indexing (LaSSI) (Schneider et al.,) techniques were adopted to compute chemical similarity from molecular descriptors. Word2vec (Asgari and Mofrad,) has been adapted to protein sequences (ProtVec) for classification of protein families and predication of disordered proteins. Wan and Zeng used term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to learn compound representations from Morgan fingerprints. While substructures of a molecule are hashed to a binary fingerprint (possibly sparse) in the case of the fingerprints, the Mol2vec approach, proposed by Jaeger et al., forms a vector with continuous and dense values. The SMILES2Vec (Goh et al.,) a model introduces a direct conversion of chemical structures from SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) strings into vectors. These works show that RL technologies represented by Word2vec can automatic learn low-dimensional features from compound and protein feature space and achieve excellent performances, suggesting its advantages in both efficiency and effectiveness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9207, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, new SPVec vectors were constructed via the combination of SMILES2Vec and ProtVec to represent specific DTIs, where the drug representation was simplified by using SMILES directly. The whole pipeline of DTI prediction in this article is shown in Figure 1, in comparison with a tradition pipeline. Not like RL who can atomically learn lower-dimensional features without human resources and expert insights, traditional feature engineering usually contains a lot of steps, including feature extraction, feature selection and dimensionality reduction, while every step need professional knowledge and extra time. For example, Fingerprint-based features are sparse and high-dimensional, thus dimensional reduction is necessary. Feature importance analysis and feature selection might be indispensable for mixed features, such as physicochemical properties, structural and evolutionary information and interaction information. It only takes several hours for feature presentation by SPVec training on a modern quad-core CPU, while dozens of days are required for traditional feature engineering. To evaluate the performance of SPVec, the constructed vectors was fed into several state-of-art machine learning classifiers such as GBDT, RF and DNN on BindingDB (Gilson et al.,).

We used dataset_1 as the training set to learn features and construct the ML models and then tested their performances on the datasets with new data. The classification performances on dataset_1 via 10 \u00d7 5-fold cross-validation and performances on independent test sets like dataset_1, dataset_2, and dataset_3 using GBDT, RF and DNN are summarized in Table 4 with their ROC curves shown in Figure 4. As in Table 4, the ML approaches equipped with the SPVec features got quite high AUC on the training set, which is similar to the results on BindingDB. Although DNN architecture was outperformed by the tree-based methods GBDT and RF in both cases, we would like to note the possibility that further fine-tuning might a little bit improve the prediction performance of the SPVec-DNN combination. Table 4 shows that SPVec performed satisfactorily on the test sets, suggesting acceptable generalization capacity and competitive performance of SPVec for the prediction of novel DTIs in drug repositioning or drug rediscovery, which is also suggested by the ROC curves in Figure 4. Among the four test sets, all three classifiers achieve highest AUC on dataset_2 to predict new interactions between old drugs and old targets, while the prediction results on the interactions with new drugs or new targets are much worse, which is extraordinary obvious in the ROC curves of dataset_5 in Figure 4. A possible explanation is that the newly found drugs or targets are not studied adequately and many potential DTIs between them have not been identified yet. Thus, the reduced accuracy of the data impairs the accuracy of the models. It is also worth noting that the negative sample was constructed by randomly selection from the unlabeled data, where the portion of unidentified potential positive DTI pairs may be even higher in smaller datasets. At last, the distributions of the new DTIs in the vector space of the test sets may be deviated from that of the training set, and impair the robustness of the models.", "sentences": [],

For example, the newly found interactions in Drugbank might be thought negative in dataset_1. To further evaluate the validity of SPVec predictions on DTIs, the possibilities of all unlabeled DTIs in DrugBank dataset were evaluated using SPVec-GBDT and the top five ranked interactions were tested by external supporting evidences from several reference databases like PubChem (Wang et al.,), KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto,), ChEMBL (Gaulton et al.,) and biomedical literatures. As a result, two of the top five predicted DTIs were confirmed by existing evidences (Table 5). The tyrosine-protein kinase Yes (Target ID: P07947, also known as Yes1) has been implicated as a potential therapeutic target in lots of cancers including breast cancers, melanomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas. Saracatinib (Drug ID: DB11805) was identified by Patel et al. as a potent Yes1 kinase inhibitor with the IC50 as low as 6.2nM. Our results also predicted the interaction between Pelitinib (Drug ID: DB05524) and membrane-associated tyrosine and threonine-specific cdc2-inhibitory kinase (Target ID: P42262) which was confirmed by PubChem database. Pelitinib (EKB-569) is a potent, low molecular weight, selective, and irreversible inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in development as an anticancer agent, while membrane-associated tyrosine and threonine-specific cdc2-inhibitory kinase is the kinase domain of human myt1.

Visualization of SPVec vectors nicely illustrates that the derived vectors from similar structures locate closely in the vector space, suggesting that they may implicitly reveals some important biophysical and biochemical patterns. Based on BindingDB and DrugBank database, SPVec vectors were fed into several state-of-art machine learning methods like GBDT, RF and DNN to train DTIs prediction models. The results using BindingDB have shown that the proposed models can achieve better prediction performance than manually extracted features like the combination of MACCS and AAC. Also, the results tested on DrugBank datasets indicated that our approach, especially SPVec-GBDT, can discover reliable DTIs in newly found drugs and targets, which might be beneficial for drug re-profiling. At last, all the unlabeled DTIs in DrugBank database was repredicted by the SPVec-GBDT model, and two of the top five predicted novel DTIs were confirmed by external evidences from other databases or biomedical literatures.
