The receptor REarranged during Transfection (RET) plays an important role by ligand independent activation of kinase domain resulting in carcinogenesis. Presently, the treatment for RET driven NSCLC is limited to multiple kinase inhibitors. This situation necessitates the discovery of novel and potent RET specific inhibitors. Thus, we employed high throughput screening strategy to repurpose FDA approved compounds from DrugBank comprising of 2509 molecules. It is worth noting that the initial screening is accomplished with the aid of in-house machine learning model built using IC50 values corresponding to 2854 compounds obtained from BindingDB repository. A total of 497 compounds (19%) were predicted as actives by our generated model. Subsequent in silico validation process such as molecular docking, MMGBSA and density function theory analysis resulted in identification of two lead compounds named DB09313 and DB00471. The simulation study highlights the potency of DB00471 (Montelukast) as potential RET inhibitor among the investigated compounds. In the end, the half-minimal inhibitory activity of montelukast was also predicted against RET protein expressing LC-2/ad cell lines demonstrated significant anticancer activity.

The alterations to RET enhance constitutive and ligand-independent activation of kinase domain, which in turn triggers carcinogenesis. Till date, two primary mechanism of RET alterations have been reported: (i) point mutations and (ii) chromosomal rearrangements. RET point mutations occur in cysteine residues resulting in aberrant dimerization and persistent activation of the kinase domain (e.g., C634R/W, C620R). Notably, on sequencing more than 10,000 distinct metastatic tumours, RET mutations have been discovered in 2.4% of all cases, especially in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer. Alternatively, RET rearrangement causes constitutive activation of the receptor by forming a fusion protein that encompasses of RET kinase domain and dimerized domain of the other fusion partners. Remarkably, RET fusions are observed in NSCLC (1\u20132%), papillary thyroid cancer (10\u201320%) and in other cancer subtypes such as breast and colorectal cancer.

LR maps the dependent and independent variables to estimate the probability threshold using the sigmoid function. RF model is developed based on large number of trees created during the random seed split. This approach creates trees at random to avoid data overfitting, which is then combined by the RF classifier to produce a single, more accurate model. The key attributes are identified and categorized into binary outcomes using the Gini score and mean decrease accuracy. DT involves mapping of interactions between nodes and leaves. The objects are depicted as nodes whereas the object value is represented as leaf. Due to its widespread application in data prediction, data analysis, and datamining, DT has become beneficial. The NB technique is a quick and easy classifier that relies on the Bayes theorem. By removing the marginal probabilities calculated based on the particular criteria, the aforementioned technique is applied to learn the likelihood of fitting to each subgroup. GB machine, a collective and non-parametric method, combines the predictions of unreliable learners to provide more reliable results than a single learner. GBM employs additive expansion for model improvements, which gives researchers more latitude than other parametric ML models. The most popular approach for tackling classification and regression issues is the SVM. By employing a structural risk reduction method during model development, SVM reduces overfitting. Instead of reducing a model's mean square error, this approach lowers the generalization error. Additionally, it sorts the input data into categories using both linear and non-linear hyperplanes.

The hydrogen bonds formed between: (i) polar SER811 residue and O of tri-ionated benzoate scaffold, (ii) NH functional group and hydrophobic LEU730 residue, (iii) NH functional group and positively charged LYS808 residue and (iv) H-bond between OH group and polar ASN879 residue of RET protein.

The literature evidences highlight that the formation of halogen bond between the ligand and the aromatic protein residue will significantly increase the residence time of the inhibitor in the human body. Thus, the increased half-life period of DB09313 reported in Table 4 might be due to the halogen bond formation during the interaction.

Finally, the stability analysis using molecular dynamic simulation of these two active molecules resulted in identification of montelukast as a prominent inhibitor against RET protein. It is to be noted that montelukast demonstrated cytotoxic activity against various lung cancer cell lines including A549 and CL1-5 together with adequate pharmacokinetic and ADMET profiles. Based on these collective evidences and findings, we hypothesize that montelukast could be utilised in treating RET positive NSCLC patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 48346, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Information", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 48372, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 48432, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Publisher's Note", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 48449, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 48568, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title"}, "text": "Author contributions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 48589, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
