Specifically, for example, as indicated by the anonymous reviewer of the first version of this publication: LE, whether derived from deltaG, K d , K i , or IC 50 , has an arbitrary 1\u00a0M concentration unit built into it. Changing this unit will, in general, result in a change in the perception of efficiency. Therefore, the dependence of LE, e.g. derived from deltaG, on the concentration used to define the standard state implies that LE derived from deltaG is thermodynamically meaningless. However, despite the fact that although the con arguments were basically introduced as early as 2009, the situation is still not clear, just to cite a recent discussion. In the Ref. we read: LE [\u2026] widely used to normalize potency for size, does not, in fact, normalize potency for size. LE decreases and appears to plateau as size, or number of heavy atoms, increases. Several plausible hypotheses were proposed to explain this observation in terms of ligand flexibility and/or entropic penalties, reduced surface area available for interaction, target specific restrictions and size-dependent complexity that reduced the probability of optimal fitting. The answer requires a simple example of fuel efficiency to justify the mathematics of LE trends. In fact, neither the critics nor the advocates were precise enough to provide any understandable mathematics or chemistry of the LE metrics. Moreover, because these parameters are in common use as early estimators for drug optimization, apparently the numerous con arguments appeared to be not convincing enough for the drug design audience. The reason is that this allowed for the understanding of the mathematical or chemical inaccuracies; however, they have never cleared the reason for the observed puzzle of the LE (BEI) hyperbolic trend explicitly enough.

However, it is not always easy to distinguish between these two data types. Let us analyze molecular weight (MW). It can be a property when measured for molecules, e.g. in MS spectrometry or even when we are weighting a mole, i.e. the Avogadro number of the molecules or its fraction, but alternatively it can also be a descriptor when we are estimating the MW of a single molecule simply by summing the atomic mass contributions to the total MW. The weight of 1\u00a0mol of a substance will be its MW (g/mol), while the weight of a single molecule will be its MW (Da).

Accordingly, PEHAC is the interaction of two terms. The first is Pmol/MW, i.e. Pmol normalized by MW. This term defines also BEI which is a possible LE alternative. A second term MW/HAC rescales BEI into the HAC dimension. To properly understand the operations described by Eqs.\u00a02 and 3, we explained the fragmental (Fig.\u00a01a), molar (Fig.\u00a01b) and weight (Fig.\u00a01c) metrics that are used to map atomic molecules (Fig.\u00a01a) into a real substances (Fig.\u00a01b, c) in chemistry.

Alternatively, mapping by weight metric will preserve the constant weight, e.g., 1\u00a0g. A surprising feature of the latter method of mapping is that the difference in a number of molecules in 1\u00a0g will be given by the numbers of NA\u00a0*\u00a01/MW1 and NA\u00a0*\u00a01/MW2, respectively.

The relationship between a chemical structure and its physical or chemical properties is an essential concept in chemistry and this method is an important decision-making guide, for example, in drug design. In fact however, it is the market that eventually decides the success of any pharmaceutical; therefore; we need economic considerations to fully understand a fate of a drug. Economic behavior, in particular, a price of a drug is an example of the nonbinding parameter important for molecular design. Is there any relationship between a chemical structure of a drug and its economic potential? On the one hand, explaining economic effects is an extremely complex issue. On the other hand little market data is available for drugs. Accordingly, the problem remains unexplored. In contrast, to drugs a variety of economic data are available for other chemicals. Therefore, in Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d, we present a structure-economy analysis for a commercial compound library of ca. 2.5 mln synthetic building blocks. It is critical to note that the price, which is an economic property, is typically listed in the catalogs of chemical compounds in $/g (Fig.\u00a03a) and not $/mol (Fig.\u00a03c), which means the efficiency scale is standard in economics. The relationships observed in Figs\u00a03a, c determines market behavior of a large quantity of chemicals. This decides that instead of a single model a bunch of linear plots can be identified in Fig.\u00a03c relating molar prices to MW, while weight prices (Fig.\u00a03a) form a series of horizontal plots, i.e., within each individual plot weight price does not depend upon MW (Fig.\u00a03a). To further investigate the price data in Fig.\u00a03b, d, we illustrated their MW binned statistics. This indicates that in economics the price of a sample normalized by weight is on average unvarying across a large range of MWs, while mean molar price forms a linear plot versus MW. Accordingly, with a decreasing MW, on average, we can get a larger number of molecules at the same price. Instead, if normalized to the molar metric, the same fragments are cheaper at smaller MWs. Interestingly, even now the plot of the mean price (the LE type parameter) versus MW indicates a drop of prices at the low MWs, which can be interpreted as a hyperbolic like trend (Fig.\u00a03b). However, this effect can be observed only within the lowest MW range, despite the fact that the molar and weight metrics are in a similar mathematical relation as the binding properties, i.e. the price $/g is given by the interaction of the molar price and 1/MW. Mean molar price is more or less a linear function of MW (Fig.\u00a03d) or in other words, an increase of MW also means an increase of the weight of a sample to be paid. The larger the quantity of weight, the larger is also the price, which is one of the essential rules of economics. Accordingly, a comparison of the binding versus economic LE data type illustrates that the understanding of important chemical effect is required to understand the LE trends versus molecular size. While the stoichiometry of ligand-target pairing limits the binding LE, the macroscopic weight determines the price. Unlike binding, pricing is not a statistical property; therefore, hypothetically, the price can tag a single molecule.

Therefore, in Fig.\u00a03e\u2013g, we present several molecular descriptors which show the molar and weight normalization, respectively, and was calculated for a large chemical compound library of ca. 2.5 mln chemical compounds.
