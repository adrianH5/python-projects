Aside from infections of the lungs, the disease can spread throughout the body and damage many other tissues, leading to multiorgan failure in severe cases. The highly variable symptom severity is influenced by genetic predispositions and preexisting diseases which have not been investigated in a large-scale multimodal manner. We present a holistic analysis framework, setting previously reported COVID-19 genes in context with prepandemic data, such as gene expression patterns across multiple tissues, polygenetic predispositions, and patient diseases, which are putative comorbidities of COVID-19. First, we generate a multimodal network using the prior-based network inference method KiMONo. We then embed the network to generate a meaningful lower-dimensional representation of the data. The input data are obtained via the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx), containing expression data from a range of tissues with genomic and phenotypic information of over 900 patients and 50 tissues. The generated network consists of nodes, that is, genes and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for several diseases/phenotypes, as well as for COVID-19 severity and hospitalization, and links between them if they are statistically associated in a regularized linear model by feature selection. Applying network embedding on the generated multimodal network allows us to perform efficient network analysis by identifying nodes close by in a lower-dimensional space that correspond to entities which are statistically linked. By determining the similarity between COVID-19 genes and other nodes through embedding, we identify disease associations to tissues, like the brain and gut. We also find strong associations between COVID-19 genes and various diseases such as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and hypertension. Moreover, we find evidence linking PTPN6 to a range of comorbidities along with the genetic predisposition of COVID-19, suggesting that this kinase is a central player in severe cases of COVID-19. In conclusion, our holistic network inference coupled with network embedding of multimodal data enables the contextualization of COVID-19-associated genes with respect to tissues, disease states, and genetic risk factors.

In severe cases, the disease leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious lung condition resulting in low blood oxygen.

Hence, it is not surprising that studies demonstrated the effect of COVID-19 onto a wide range of systems, including cardiovascular, renal, hepatobiliary, and neurological systems.

In our previous work, we developed KiMONo, a versatile network inference tool that leverages prior information from existing biological networks to reduce the high-dimensional input space and model every gene measurement individually using a sparse group lasso. By aggregating selected features from KiMONo\u2019s statistical models, a network consisting of different modalities can be generated, connecting the modeled genes with their explanatory variables. Such a multimodal network is, however, highly complex and difficult to analyze with classical network analysis tools, such as degree and betweenness analysis or module detection algorithms. To mine the network and extract meaningful associations, graph representation learning approaches have shown great promise when applied to analyze complex biomedical networks. The geometry of this embedding space is optimized to capture meaningful similarities or associations between nodes of a given network. It can be utilized to infer relationships between nodes in a network, for example, between genes and genetic risk score or genes and tissues and to understand the multimodal context for each factor of interest. The first efforts to prioritize important connected nodes have been conducted by GeneWalk. Briefly, GeneWalk generates a low-dimensional embedding space of a gene\u2013gene network together with their biological Gene Ontology terms by learning the relationships between nodes from random walks over the multimodal network.

However, data on COVID-19 including clinical phenotypes, genomic, and transcriptomic measures on a large scale and for different tissues of populations are still sparse, and therefore, cannot be fully exploited by multi-omics data integration methods to generate a global multi-tissue and cross-individual view of the disease. Thus, we leverage a population dataset prior to the COVID-19 outbreak that comprises comprehensive multi-tissue, multi-omics, and deep phenotyping data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. In this study, we take an orthogonal approach to understand the complexity of symptoms, affected tissue, and individual genetic variation to the molecular response to COVID-19.

risk and disease state information in order to better understand diseases, especially COVID-19, in their complex context. First, a multimodal network was inferred using KiMONo which associates genes with all other data modalities, consisting of genes, tissues, phenotypes, comorbidities, and PRS, using multiple regression. Second, all nodes were projected into an embedding space using the method GeneWalk. For efficient analysis of the embedding, similarity scores were employed, under the assumption that associated nodes are in the proximity within the embedding space. We showed that the multimodal network from the GTEx pre-corona population cohort was of high quality being able to achieve high gene model performances using the  measures. Furthermore, we assured the quality of the embeddings by optimizing the parameters such that we maximize the variance of the resulting node pair cosine similarity distribution. The fact that similarity scores between any two vectors had low standard deviation across the 100 runs reflects the robustness of the resulting embeddings.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 53717, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We validated the relevance of the network embedding by showing that tissue-specific genes were significantly more enriched in the set of genes with the highest similarity scores to the tissue of interest, as compared with the set of genes with the lowest similarity scores. Thus, our method was able to capture the most important factors for each node of interest. The embedding was also validated by recapitulating disease-related factors such as for the disease ischemic heart disease, T2D, and MDD or the genetic predisposition for chronic kidney disease and cancer. Interestingly, those top similar nodes come from a diverse degree of neighborhood of the initial KiMONo network, which confirms that the embedding helps capture highly relevant relationships between nodes. In summary, we were able to (1) prioritize important factors from multitude of connections in the original network and (2) pick up factors that were connected over 1, 2, and 3 hops. With the embedding, the relationship between any two nodes could be examined in the full network context and does not need to be restricted to directly connected ones. The information gain exceeding the original network is due to the embedding which is learned by using sequences within random walks as training examples. In this way, the larger context of each node is being taken into account for the embedding.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 55089, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We delineated the multimodal context of previously identified COVID-19 genes. Strikingly, different experimental types captured different information. While the networks from genes that were derived from physical interaction experiments were able to elucidate the roles of ribosomal proteins, the genes from CRISPR studies had a focus on proteases and genes that had COVID-19 comorbidities in their proximity such as SMARCA5 and TRAF3, involved in chromatin remodeling and activation of viral response. Furthermore, the networks from whole blood samples of patients revealed the role of many proteases and ribosomes that had many genetic risks in their proximity. Others were coupled to functions such as DNA repair, ubiquitination, and functions within the cytoskeleton. Another interesting gene only present in the patient\u2019s blood data was PTPN6; it was associated with the highest amount of comorbidities, ranging from COPD to hypertension. This gene was less associated with the genetic risk for different diseases but with the actual development of them, making this gene a central player for COVID-19 when other comorbidities were already present.

In addition, we limited the PRS only to GWAS studies, selecting the diseases that have been found to be most relevant for COVID-19, while many others are of potential relevance in a cross-tissue cross-disease cohort.
