However, the potential role of SPATS2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the functional implication of SPATS2 in ESCC. The ESCC cell lines Eca109 and KYSE-150 were used to conduct loss-of-function experiments. The expression patterns of SPATS2 in patients with ESCC were obtained from Oncomine, The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were applied to determine the expression levels of SPATS2 in ESCC cells. The proliferation of ESCC cells was measured via cell proliferation and colony-formation assays. Subsequently, the migration and invasion capacities of ESCC cells were observed using Transwell assays. Finally, the expression levels of P53, cyclin E, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and neuronal-cadherin were determined via western blot analysis. SPATS2 was expressed at higher levels in ESCC tissues compared with the controls, and high expression of SPATS2 was associated with poor prognosis. ESCC cell line proliferation, migration and invasion abilities were suppressed after silencing SPATS2. Moreover, following knockdown of SPATS2, the proteins cyclin E, MMP-9 and N-cadherin were expressed at markedly decreased levels, while P53 expression was increased.
