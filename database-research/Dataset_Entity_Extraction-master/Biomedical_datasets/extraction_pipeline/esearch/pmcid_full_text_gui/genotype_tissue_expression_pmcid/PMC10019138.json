The most common pathological type of cervical cancer is cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC). When patients with CESC are diagnosed and treated in the early stage of the tumor, the chance of survival can be increased and may push the 5-year survival rate to 90%. However, the early symptoms of cervical cancer are not obvious. Seventy percent of cervical cancer patients are in the middle and late stage of the disease when they are diagnosed with cervical cancer, which will be very unfavorable to the treatment of patients. Currently, the diagnosis of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer is based on cervical cytology/human papilloma virus (HPV) testing, colposcopy, and cervical biopsy. Cervical cytology and HPV testing are the basic methods of screening, but HPV testing has low specificity, cytology has low sensitivity, and colposcopy is somewhat subjective, easily missing lesions in the cervical canal and affecting the accuracy of diagnosis. Therefore, highly sensitive and specific tests are needed to improve the efficiency of early diagnosis of cervical cancer. In addition, about 31% of cervical cancer recurred after treatment, and most recurrences occurred within 2 years after the first diagnosis. The treatment of cervical cancer is very difficult and the prognosis is very poor. The 1-year survival rate is only 8.12%. The prognosis of cervical cancer is closely related to many factors, including tumor size, lymph node metastasis, depth of interstitial infiltration, lymph-vascular space invasion, medical diseases such as diabetes and obesity, and serum biomarkers. Scientific and accurate assessment of these factors and selection of appropriate treatment options can effectively reduce the mortality rate of CESC.

However, only a small number of patients are sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune desert microenvironment is a kind of immune microenvironment, which is characterized by the extreme lack of all kinds of immune cells in tumor tissues. Patients with immune desert TIME were resistant to immunotherapy. Thus, finding new genes regulating immune microenvironment is of great significance to prompt the efficacy of immunotherapy and improve the prognosis of patients. In this study, we found that LRP11 expression was negatively correlated with ImmuneScore, Stromalcore, and ESTIMATEScore, while positively correlated with tumor purity in CESC. These results indicated that patients with high expression of LRP11 may have immune desert TME. To further prove this, we downloaded immune cell infiltrate data from ImmuCellAI and TIMER2.0 database and analyzed the relationship of LRP11 with various immune cells. We observed that LRP11 is negatively correlated with infiltration level of most immune cells, such as CD8 T cells, NK cells, gamma delta T cells, and B cells. These results proved that patients with high LRP11 expression may have immune desert tumor microenvironment. It was reported that the activation of TGF beta1 signaling and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling could induce the immune desert tumor microenvironment. We found that LRP11 expression was positively correlated with genes involved in TGF beta1 signaling and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in pan-cancer and CESC. The above results all indicated that patients with high expression of LRP11 gene are in a status of immune desert TME, which may be the potential tumor-promoting mechanism of LRP11.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20624, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "5.
