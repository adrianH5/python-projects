Second, it should be in an actively transcribed region and not be targeted by silencing mechanisms, allowing cell type- and tissue-specific expression. Most importantly, for safety consideration, a GSH should not overlap any known functional sequences in the genome, including exons, promoters, enhancers, transcription units, and ultra-conserved regions, or affect nearby gene expression. So far, only a few human GSHs have been defined, including AAVS1, CCR5, and the human ortholog of the mouse Rosa26 locus. However, none of the current GSH sites show adequate evidence for therapeutic safety. For example, the inserted gene in the AAVS1 site could affect the expression of myosin binding subunit 85 (PPP1R12C) and could also be silenced.

Generally, those criteria require a minimal linear distance from functional DNA elements such as promoters, enhancers, and coding sequences. However, the distance selected is usually arbitrary, and the locus-specific features along the genome are not considered. For example, a locus that is linearly distant from a gene can still be involved in long-range chromatin interaction and contribute to gene activation. Indeed, several studies have shown regulation of genes through long-range interactions. In addition, most current methods are based only on genomic features and do not consider tissue-specific gene expression and regulatory elements.

Because common pMEIs, especially those with high AF in the genomes of healthy people, can harbor large insertions (300 base pairs (bps)\u20146000 bps) without apparent deleterious effects, we reasoned that these pMEI sites are plausible candidates for GSH selection (Fig. 1a). From common pMEIs, we remove pMEIs associated with tissue-specific gene expression based on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis (Fig. 1b). To assess the potential interactions between transgene and the genome of host cells, we use genomic spatial proximity information identified by technologies such as whole-genome Hi-C and promoter capture Hi-C. These technologies can extract genome-wide interactions among different genomic loci. These unbiased long-range interactions allow us to remove pMEI sites that may affect functionally significant genes, such as oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and dosage-sensitive genes, through long-range interactions (Fig. 1c). To avoid heterochromatin regions that can potentially decrease the transgene cassette integration and transcription efficiency, genomic regions with repressive and quiescent state markers are also excluded (Fig. 1d).

Gene and cellar therapies have the potential to treat once-incurable diseases. However, the functions of the human genome are not fully understood. Avoiding unintended changes in important genomic regions remains a major consideration during genome engineering. A large amount of effort has been spent to establish complicated experiment systems to identify and prevent these potential deleterious effects. However, since the functional consequences of genomic alternation may only be detected in a specific cell type during a specific development stage and/or under specific conditions, it is challenging to include all these factors in the experimental design.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24264, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we developed a novel GSH discovery approach. First, we select GSH candidate regions based on common pMEIs in healthy human populations. Because these pMEIs have been subjected to hundreds of thousands of years of purifying selection and remained common in human populations, they marked genomic regions that are selectively neutral with little or no impact on genomic functions. Among common pMEIs, we then excluded loci that are associated with tissue-specific expression of nearby genes to further increase the likelihood of selecting region with no functional impacts. Second, unlike most current GSH mapping approaches that mask genome with arbitrary defined linear windows near important DNA elements, our approach is knowledge-based and considers 3D chromatin organizations of the genome and the 3D spatial distance between genomic loci. Third, stable expression of the transgene is essential for an effective gene therapy. Thus, it is crucial that the GSHs are outside of the repressive/heterochromatin regions. To this end, we use tissue-specific epigenetic signatures to identify genomic regions that are open for transcription in the tissue of interest. This step is crucial for GSH selection, as we found that 94.7% (5880/6206) of the pMEIs from the 1000 Genomes project overlaps repressive chromatin marks. More importantly, we identified no shared GSHs between blood and brain. The large amount of tissue-specific repressive regions in the genome and the tissue-specific nature of the candidate GSHs highlight the importance of including tissue-specific epigenetic information for GSH identification. Using a cell-culture system, we showed that GFP transgene cassette can be effectively integrated into candidate GSH loci. After integration, the cassettes were stably expressed for several months, and they did not alter the expression of nearby genes in host cells. These results demonstrate that our method can identify tissue-specific GSH candidates. It is worth mentioning that the commonly used AAVS1 locus is located within a high gene density TAD. In our cell line-based validation system, GFP cassette integration in AAVS1 significantly altered the expression of two nearby genes.

Although our validation experiments demonstrate promising results, our experiments have several limitations and the GSHs we tested should not be considered fully validated. One safety concern of gene therapy is that the integration of gene expression cassettes can potentially change RNA splicing of host genes. Even though no significant alternative splicing events were detected in our study, we cannot completely exclude the possibility for other expression cassettes, especially those with splicing acceptor consensus sequences, could affect the nearby gene splicing. Thus, carefully assessing the splicing events is important for new expression cassettes. Another concern is the transcriptional leakage of gene expression cassettes. In our validation experiment, we observed transcriptional leakage that can extend up to 600 bps downstream of GFP cassettes. One potential solution is adding insulator elements to the cassettes. Another limit in our pipeline is that some functional genomic data used are from cell lines instead of more clinically relevant primary cells such as CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). This is largely due to the data availability. Our pipeline does have an option to let users provide their own functional genomic data and identify best GSHs for their own systems. Last but not least, we used a GFP expression cassette in our experimental validation. Since transgene-genome interaction can be transgene-dependent, expression cassettes with different transgene can potentially induce different local epigenetic and chromatin interaction changes. Thus, researchers should perform their own tests to select the GSHs that work the best for their specific studies.
