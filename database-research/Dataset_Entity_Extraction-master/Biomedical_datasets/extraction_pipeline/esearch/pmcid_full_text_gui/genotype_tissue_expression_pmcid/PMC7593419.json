We also analyzed the biological functions of these RBPs and their relationship to clinical outcome. There were 190 RBPs that were differentially expressed between OSC and normal tissues, including 93 that were upregulated and 97 that were downregulated. Five of the RBPs were used to construct a prediction model that was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.

Reduced ZNF239 and PSMA6 and elevated PCBP3 and RPS4Y1 levels were associated with worse prognosis. The mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) are the counterpart of cytoplasmic ribosomes relating to maintain mitochondrial DNA stability. The MRPL14 single nucleotide polymorphism may be related to diabetic retinopathy through steroid metabolism or insulin resistance. MRPL14 is highly expressed in thyroid tumor, but does not reveal the relationship with prognosis. In the past 5 years, no relationship between ZNF239 and any type of tumor has been reported. The proteasome gene, PMSA6, encodes the a1 protein, which is involved in the formation of the outer rings of the 20s core proteasome and is subject to post-translational regulation. The location of the PSMA6 gene occurs in a region containing microsatellites that have been implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Grave\u2019s disease, asthma, ankylosing spondylitis, and myocardial infarction. In a lung cancer study, the expression of PSMA6 was up-regulated, and knocking out PSMA6 could induce lung cancer tumor cell apoptosis or the cell cycle to enter the arrest phase. However, in our study, the expression of PSMA6 in OSC is down-regulated, and the low expression of PSMA6 is associated with a worse OSC prognosis, which may be due to the different effects of PSMA6 expression on proteasome activity. PSMA6 has carcinogenic effects in various tissue tumors. Actually, the ubiquitination-proteasome degradation pathway has been proved to be the key to cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, the detailed molecular mechanism of PSMA6 in OSC needs to be revealed. The poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs), an RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation, whose important functions are mRNA activation, translation activation and translation silencing.
