In this genome database study, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression and Gene Expression Omnibus databases, the potential role of RCC1 in 33 tumors\u2019 entities was explored. The results show that RCC1 is highly expressed in most human malignant neoplasms in contrast to healthy tissues. RCC1 expression is closely related to the prognosis of a broad variety of tumor patients. Enrichment analysis showed that some tumor-related pathways such as \u201ccell cycle\u201d and \u201cRNA transport\u201d were involved in the functional mechanism of RCC1. In particular, the conducted analysis reveals the relation of RCC1 to multiple immune checkpoint genes and suggests that the regulation of RCC1 is closely related to tumor infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and CD8+ T cells. Coherent data demonstrate the association of RCC1 with the tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability in various tumors.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 have been applied therapeutically and have obtained impressive clinical benefits. Therefore, in addition to immune infiltration, this study also analyzed the relationship between RCC1 expression and the expression of 47 common immune checkpoint genes and found that they are related in a variety of tumors, including KIRC and KICH. In KIRC and KICH, the expression of RCC1 was positively correlated with the expression of both PD-1 and/or CTLA4. In view of the current research showing that the combined use of PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab) and CTLA4 inhibitors (ipilimumab) brings significant survival advantages for patients with renal cell carcinoma, the strong correlation between RCC1 and the two checkpoints indicates that it may be a powerful immunotherapy marker for KICH and KIRC. A recently conducted study in non-small cell lung cancer pointed out that downregulation of RCC1 can increase the sensitivity of immunotherapy by upregulating PD-L1 through the p27kip1/CDK4 axis. In addition, most RCC1 positive tumors correlated with CD276 and NRP1 (Figure 7c). Current research shows that CD276 expression is elevated in most tumors, including melanoma and lung cancer, and is closely related to the inhibition of T-cell response and immune evasion of tumors. CD276 has become an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. The use of monoclonal antibodies against CD276 has shown encouraging results in a phase I clinical trial. Based on the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab and nivolumab), RCC1 may play a potential role in predicting the therapeutic response of CD276 inhibitors developed for clinical use in the future and has potential clinical significance.

In addition, the research on NRP1 monoclonal antibodies and cell penetrating peptides highlights it as a promising new target for cancer therapy. Considering the importance of NRP1 in tumor development and its relevance to RCC1 in a variety of tumors, combined with RCC1 involved in CAF and the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, we believe that RCC1 might be a potential new tumor target involved in the immunosuppressive function of NRP1. Although no regulatory relationships between RCC1 and CD276 as well as NRP1 have been reported in the literature, a potential regulatory network was identified based on the GeneMANIA 3.6.0 (, accessed on 20 June 2021) tool (Supplementary Figure S9).

This study found that there is a positive correlation between RCC1 expression and TMB in tumors such as KIRC and KICH, combined with the correlation between RCC1 and immune checkpoint genes, which seems to suggest a potential relationship among the three. In addition, it was shown that MSI, together with TMB and PD-1/CTLA4 expression, can serve as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy. The present study clarified that the expression of RCC1 is positively correlated with MSI in a variety of tumors including GBM, ACC and COAD.

This study provides important insights on clarifying the role of RCC1 in oncogenesis. In particular, it shows a link between RCC1 and p53 for the first time. In addition, it also advances the understanding of the impact of RCC1 on tumor immunology with significant correlation to CAF and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells.
