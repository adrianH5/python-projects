HSPs in the same family usually have similar sequences and share functional domains.

HSPs often function collaboratively to ensure the correct process of protein folding. For example, HSP40s often act as co-chaperones to transfer premature/misfolded peptides to HSP70s, through which the peptide can be correctly folded to make mature proteins.

Furthermore, HSP families also showed dual functional effects across these cancer hallmarks. For example, in the HSP70 family, HSPA5 and HSPA6 were positively associated with the hypoxia score in 23 and 20 cancers, respectively, while HSPA1L was negatively associated with hypoxia in 19 cancers. In the HSP40 family, DNAJC25 and DNAJC8 were positively associated with stemness in 16 and 14 cancers, respectively, while DNAJC11 and DNAJC3 were negatively associated with stemness in 25 and 25 cancers, respectively. In the HSP20 family, HSPB6 was negatively associated with glycolysis in 14 cancers, while HSPB1 was positively associated with glycolysis in 11 cancers. These results suggest that interactively identifying associations between HSPs and cancer hallmarks is necessary to detect individual HSPs as targets in anti-cancer treatment.

Fifteen genes showed positive associations with hallmarks across 17 cancer types (Fig. 6b). For example, HSP90B1 was positively associated with 9 cancer hallmarks, such as proliferation, EMT, and inflammation, which is consistent with the findings of other studies. This result suggested that HSP90B1 is a potential target in anti-cancer treatment and that it will be necessary to design a more specific inhibitor to target HSP90B1. Other potential targets include individual HSPs such as DNAJB11, an HSP40 member that is positively associated with 8 cancer hallmarks, and HYOU1, a large HSP member that is associated with 5 cancer hallmarks. In contrast, we identified 22 individual HSPs that were negatively associated with \u2265\u20095 hallmarks across 22 cancer types (Fig. 6c). Of interest, 16 (16/22, 72.7%) of them are HSP40 family members, including DNAJC28, which was associated with 10 hallmarks across 8 cancers; DNAJC19, which was associated with 8 hallmarks across 5 cancers; and DNAJC30, which was associated with 6 hallmarks across 5 cancers. That result suggested that these genes are broad suppressors of multiple cancer hallmarks. We ranked HSPs with same direction of associations across multiple cancer hallmarks (Additional file 1: Fig. S6C). For example, HSP90B1 is positively associated with six hallmarks in BRCA, and HYOU1 is positively associated with six hallmarks in LUSC, suggesting they may be candidate for targeted therapy in BRCA and LUSC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41630, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41641, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the critical role of HSPs in tumorigenesis, multiple HSP inhibitors, including pan-HSP inhibitors (e.g., KNK423) and HSP family-specific inhibitors (e.g., HSP90i 17AAG and HSP20i quercetin), have been developed during the past decades. Unfortunately, none of them has been approved by the FDA as anti-cancer treatment, which may be due to either poor drug responses or severe side effects. To aid the development of HSP inhibitors, we performed comprehensive analyses in large-scale datasets to understand the features of HSPs. Previous studies showed coordination among HSPs (e.g., HSP40s and HSP70s) in their function as chaperones. Through a comprehensive analysis of a large number of samples across tens of normal tissues and cancer types, we demonstrated a global disruption of the co-expression network of HSPs in tumor samples, suggesting disruption of the chaperone functions of HSPs in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, individual HSPs play significant roles in tumorigenesis. For example, DNAJA1, an HSP40 gene, stabilizes mutated p53 isoforms, including p53R156P and p53R157H in multiple cancers. Here, we showed global alterations of HSPs across multiple cancer types, which 79.3% of HSPs showed alterations in at least one cancer type. For example, the HSP90 family was largely upregulated, while the HSP20 family was mainly downregulated.

Here, we showed the heterogeneity of HSPs within a family. For example, in the HSP40 family, DNAJC9 promoted cell proliferation, while DNAJB2 suppressed cell proliferation. Similar to this situation, in the HSP70 family, a druggable HSP family, HSPA12B promoted metastasis, while HSPA9 suppressed metastasis. Current HSP70 inhibitors, including 15-DSG, MAL3-101, and VER155008, have been designed to target the domain or structure shared across HSP70 members. These HSP70-specific inhibitors may not distinguish HSPA9 from HSPA12B, which may lead to complicated consequences in anti-cancer therapy.

For example, 23 HSPs promoted cell proliferation but suppressed metastasis, while 19 HSPs suppressed cell proliferation but promoted metastasis. Among these, we experimentally validated the dual functions of DNAJC9 and HSPA14 in a lung cancer cell line. We further demonstrated the generalization of this pattern across multiple cancer hallmarks, including angiogenesis, hypoxia, and inflammation. Our results demonstrated the complexity of developing HSP inhibitors, even based on individual HSPs. It is necessary to design more specific HSP inhibitors based on selected HSPs. In addition, HSP and hallmark associations may have opposite effects in different subtypes. We investigated PAM50 subtypes of breast cancer, a classical subtype definition, to reveal the associations between HSP and hallmarks across different subtypes (Additional file 1: Fig. S7). We observed the opposite effects in different subtypes. For example, HSPB1 is positively associated with inflammation in basal but negatively associated with inflammation in luminal B.
