Since its previous publication in 2012, the number of entries in IDEAL has almost tripled (120 to 340). In addition to the increase in quantity, the quality of IDEAL has been significantly improved. The new IDEAL incorporates the interactions of IDPs and their binding partners more explicitly, and illustrates the protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks and the structures of protein complexes. Redundant experimental data are arranged based on the clustering of Protein Data Bank entries, and similar sequences with the same binding mode are grouped. As a result, the new IDEAL presents more concise and informative experimental data. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) disorder is annotated in a systematic manner, by identifying the regions with large deviations among the NMR models. The ordered/disordered and new domain predictions by DICHOT are available, as well as the domain assignments by HMMER. Some examples of the PPI networks and the highly deviated regions derived from NMR models will be described, together with other advances.

They are fully or partially disordered, depending on the amount of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). IDPs are abundant among eukaryotic proteins, and are localized preferentially in the nucleus. They play crucial roles in biological processes, such as signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Naturally, to gain a deep understanding of the nature of IDPs from structural and functional viewpoints, the development of IDP databases is required. For this purpose, Disprot, MobiDB and D2P2 were compiled, and each presents original information. By collecting experimentally verified IDPs and annotating them manually, we have developed IDEAL, Intrinsically Disordered proteins with Extensive Annotations and Literature (http://www.ideal.force.cs.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/IDEAL/). This database provides the ordered and disordered regions, as well as other structural and functional information, for each IDP. In particular, IDEAL pays special attention to the IDRs that adopt 3D structures on binding to their binding partners, which are described as protean segments (ProS). Although similar concepts of ProS have been proposed as molecular recognition features (MoRFs), eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) or ComSins, the details of the definitions are different from each other. ProS is simply defined if both structured and unstructured information are available, while MoRF has a length limitation of 70 residues, an ELM represents a motif expressed by a regular expression and ComSin requires structures of ligand bound and unbound states. In the initial phase of the database construction, IDEAL considered only the human IDPs localized in the nucleus, but currently it encompasses eukaryotic IDPs residing in the nucleus, or in the nucleus and other locations. As a result, the number of entries in IDEAL has tripled (340) in the past 2 years. Although IDEAL compiles the available information for each IDP, we noticed that the relationships between entries were not necessarily described well. One of the significant features of IDPs is their promiscuity. In many cases, IDPs function as the hub proteins in protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks, and thus IDPs are able to interact with many binding partners, and are controlled by posttranslational modifications (PTM) or other mediators. These results indicated the importance of examining the IDPs in the PPI networks and in the context of systems biology. In the upgraded version, IDEAL emphasizes the interactions between IDPs and their binding partners. We regard each IDEAL entry (protein) as a NODE, and the interaction of two entries (PPI) as an EDGE, and thus have prepared both NODE and EDGE pages. The NODE pages are improved versions of the previous pages, and contain detailed information for an IDP. The EDGE pages are new to this version, and show the structural complex of the entry and its binding partner. Since the NODE pages are connected by the EDGE pages, and vice versa, users can easily browse through a PPI network by following these links. The revamped version of IDEAL also features new data and an improved user interface.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 4852, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "NEW DATA", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 4861, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Binding partner", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 4877, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In IDEAL, a protein sequence is divided into regions.

Among the biological units, the one defined by the authors was selected, and the shortest C\u03b1 distance between any pair of the subunits was calculated.

When two subunits (a subunit pair) taken from each complex show >70% sequence identity, or the number of gaps in the global alignment is at most six, the subunit pair is considered to be equivalent. Note that the latter condition is applied to compare short segments. When all subunit pairs in two complexes are equivalent, and the interacting-subunit pairs are the same, the complexes are considered to be equivalent, and should be clustered.
