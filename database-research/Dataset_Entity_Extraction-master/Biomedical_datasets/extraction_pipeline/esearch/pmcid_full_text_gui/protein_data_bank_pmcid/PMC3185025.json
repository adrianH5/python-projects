Each cb EGF-like domain of fibrillin-1 contains six highly conserved cysteine residues that form three intra-domain disulphide bonds (C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6) and a consensus sequence for calcium binding in the NH2-terminal region. The mutant residue found in our study, located at the 39th residue of the cb EGF-like#15 domain, did not affect disulphide bond formation or calcium binding of the domain at the secondary structure level. 3D structure analysis by DeepView v4.0.1 showed that the substitution of serine by proline could probably induce steric clash with its surroundings, which probably resulted in a conformation change and had a predictable detrimental effect on its function. It is evident that the structural effects of different FBN1 missense mutations are complex. Mutations in cb EGF motifs not affecting cysteines or residues of the calcium binding consensus sequence are extremely rare and have been postulated to affect intramolecular packing or intermolecular interactions, and subsequently affect microfiber assembly. Previously, only 6 mutations were published in the UMD website in the cb EGF-like#15 domain, and none of those mutations affected the residues between C-5 and C-6. The present study not only suggested that residues between C-5 and C-6 of cb EGF-like domains play an important role in maintaining the function of the FBN1 protein, but also added a new case to the notion that cb EGF-like#14\u201318 domains (in exons 28\u201332) are functionally more essential in fibrillin-1 of classic MFS than that of neonatal MFS. This rare mutation found in our study is located in the hot spot region for neonatal MFS and could also cause classic MFS.
