Compared to existing studies these simulations were carried out over a much longer time scale (200 ns where the stability of the transition can be evaluated) and used an explicit water model. We considered eight different entries from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) separated into two groups. We observed that fixing the protonation state of E89 prompts the transition of the EF loop only when its side chain is oriented under the loop and into the entrance of the interior cavity. The motion of the EF loop occurs mostly as a step-function and its timing varies greatly from ~ 20 ns to ~170 ns from the beginning of the simulation. Once the transition is completed, the protein appears to reach a stable conformation as in a true two-state transition. We also observed novel findings. When the transition occurs, the hydrogen bond between E89 and S116 is replaced with a salt bridge with Lys residues in the \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif. This electrostatic interaction causes the distortion of this motif as well as the protrusion of the GH loop into the aperture of the cavity with the result of limiting the increase of its contour area despite the rotation of the EF loop.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1633, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1646, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Under physiological conditions proteins undergo several internal motions that span large time (from to s) and spatial scales (from local librations, to collective folding transitions). Often these motions are not mere fluctuations of microstates but are reversible events (frequently aided by other factors such as ligands, chaperones, etc.) that are essential to the function of polypeptides. Among the dynamic segments of proteins, loops, i.e. regions that connect highly repetitive structures (such as \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets), undergo crucial folding transitions. Loops can be short and structured (e.g. hairpins) or develop over longer and apparently unstructured conformations. They often provide flexible motifs that contribute to an array of fundamental biophysical properties such as the regulation of catalytic activity, the gating of transmembrane channels, the control of folding patterns and the access of ligands to binding sites. Conformational changes of loops can be triggered by many mechanisms that include, among others, the binding of specific ligands, structural changes of other regions of the protein or the protonation/deprotonation of residues. The prominent role played by loop mobility is evident in lipocalins, a ubiquitous family of transport proteins. Within this family one important motion is represented by the pH-dependent conformational change (also known as the Tanford transition) involving the loop that connects \u03b2-strands E and F (EF loop) in bovine \u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG). Although the detailed functional role of this transition (and indeed of the entire protein) is still not completely characterized, the leading hypothesis for the EF loop conformational change is the regulation of the access to the single interior cavity (\u03b2-barrel) of the protein which is the major binding site for fatty acids and other molecules. The EF loop is located at the rim of the cavity and experimental studies have revealed that at pH < 7.5 it folds over the entrance of the cavity and limits access to its interior. Conversely, at pH > 7.5 the loop undergoes a rotation that increases access to the cavity. Since BLG is found in the milk of most mammals, the evidence for the EF loop transition has led to the hypothesis that the mechanism is used to \u2018trap\u2019 fatty acids inside the cavity as milk travels through the acidic upper GI tract, whereas the nutrients are released in the lower GI tract, where the pH is alkaline. This sequence of events may make the nutrients more digestible in suckling animals. The event that regulates the transition has been postulated to be the deprotonation of a glutamic acid residue (E89) at the end of the loop. This residue appears to have an unusually large pKa of the side chain (~ 7.0, compared to an expected value of ~ 4.4) which has been attributed to the formation of a hydrogen bond with the S116 residue on the GH loop adjacent to the EF loop. The correlation between this unusual pKa and the pH at which the conformational change of the loop occurs, makes E89 the likely culprit of the structural change of BLG. Crystallographic data has provided the evidence of the conformational change but it has not elucidated whether the deprotonation of E89 is the cause or has provided dynamic information about the transition. Such hypothesis can be tested using computational methods that have been used to simulate protein folding as well as the association of biomolecules with ligands either alone or in support of experimental data. Surprisingly, only few examples of computational simulation of the EF loop of BLG can be found. One study by Bello et al. showed that the loop participates in the binding of fatty acids (highlighting the role that loop flexibility plays in modulating the binding of ligands). Two other studies by Fogolari et al. Fogolari et al., and Eberini et al. Eberini et al., investigated the Tanford transition in a short time window (3 ns) using an implicit water model. In addition, the structures used in those studies (2BLG and 3BLG) have starting coordinates that orient the side chain of E89 in the direction away from the cavity (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material). The study we carried, on the other hand, is an all-atom study that uses an explicit water model and extends the simulation to a time window of 200 ns, which is sufficiently long to observe the step-wise conformational transition of the EF loop. In addition, we investigated simulation results among a larger group of starting BLG structures (different BLG entries in the Protein Data Bank, PDB) to compare the effects of the initial orientation of E89 relative to the loop as well as the influence of the initial conformation of the EF loop (open vs closed) (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material). The results show that the initial orientation of the side chain of E89 is crucial to prompt the conformational changes. Only PDB entries in which the side chain of E89 is located underneath the EF loop (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material) show a significant transition upon changing the net charge of the residue.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 6774, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The closed open transition itself appears to occur mostly as a step-function and more rarely as a gradual rearrangement.

According to the paradigm for the Tanford transition the more extensive backbone excursion within the EF loop is experienced by L87 at the apex of the loop. Conversely, the bottom of the cavity (as discussed in section 3.3) represents one of the most stable portions of the protein (Figure 2 and Figure S2, supplementary material).

Although the pdb files do not contain information about the charges of the amino acids, one assumes that, experimentally they were obtained under conditions where E89 is deprotonated (E89(\u22121)). Thus, the simulations obtained with E89(\u22121) reproduce the experimental conditions while the simulations with E89(0) reproduce non-experimental conditions. A comparison of the two ionization conditions would inform us on whether, upon protonation of E89, the entries spontaneously transition back to a closed conformation. In 2BLG one notices substantial differences only in the W19-L87 distance whereby around 140 ns the distance appears to increase from 25.7 0.4 to 27.3 0.5 (Figure 4) indicating a further distancing of the apex of the EF loop to the its bottom.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 24448, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The E89-S116 and the E89-K69 distance are basically unchanged by the protonation state of E89 and remain much larger than the threshold required to form a HB (E89-S116) or a salt-bridge (E89-K69) (Figure 4). This is consistent with the fact that E89 starts (Figure S1, supplementary material) and remains to the outside of the cavity for the duration of the simulation. With E89(0) the contour area of the interior cavity progressively decreases in the first 50 ns of the simulation from an initial value of ~ 611 44 to 250 29. This 2.4-times decrease appears consistent with the Tanford transition (i.e. the protonation of E89 of an experimentally deprotonated entry causes the closure of the entrance of the interior cavity), and with the decrease the W19-L87 distance. However, Figures S6 and S10 (supplementary material) suggest, the closure of the cavity is prompted mostly by the side chain of L87 rotating from perpendicular to parallel to the entrance of the cavity, rather than by a rotation of the entire EF loop. With E89(\u22121) the last 20 ns show a slight increase (~12%) of the area in correlation to the increased W19-L87 distance which follows a further rotation of the EF loop away from the entrance of the interior cavity (Figures 4 and 5). In the same group, 1BSY shows a sharper effect of the W19-L87 distance whereby changing the protonation state from E89(\u22121) to E89(0) prompts the distance to decrease in a stepwise profile at ~ 160 ns (Figure S3A, supplementary material). This step corresponds to the rotation of the EF loop in a closed configuration which can be clearly seen in Figure S6 (supplementary material). Nevertheless, this step does not appear to produce any other major effects since E89 remains on the side of the surface of the protein and does not participate in the HB with S116 or the salt bridge with the Lys residues (K60 or K69) of the \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif. The area of the entrance of the cavity reduces substantially (from 682 81 with E89(\u22121) to 400 28 with E89(0)) but the transition is gradual and does not follow the same dramatic step as the W19-L87 distance. The behavior of 3NPO is peculiar. A transition occurs that appears to be opposite to the Tanford transition. The deprotonation of E89, in fact, prompts the EF loop to assume a closed instead of open conformation. This transition proceeds in two steps that occur at ~ 110 ns and ~ 125 ns as shown by the profile of the W19-L87 distance with E89(\u22121) (Figure S3A, supplementary material). The first step seems to be the one that causes the aperture of the cavity to partially shut (Figure S3, supplementary material A) from 832 80 with to 400 44. The conformational change of the EF loop can also be clearly observed in Figures S7 and S10 (supplementary material). Conversely, no effects are noticed with the position of E89 relative to S116 or K60 and K69 (Figure S3A, supplementary material). E89 remains on the outside of the protein and the distance between its side chain and the one of S116 or the two lysine residues remains well above the threshold to form HB or a SB.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27540, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Group 2", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27548, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The starting structures for the members of this group are obtained at acidic and neutral pH, and show the inital EF loop in closed conformation (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material). The results of the simulations provide two different sets of observation. Entry 3BLG shows that for the last 40 ns of the simulation the W19-L87 distance is basically identical between the E89(0) and E89(\u22121) forms of the protein (Figure S3B, supplementary material). Before that, E89(\u22121) appears to transiently destabilize the EF loop which attempts to transition to at least a partially open conformation for periods of < 10 ns each time. Entry 3BLG is one in which the initial configuration includes the HB between E89 and S116. With E89(0) this HB appears to break and re-form constantly throughout the simulation with a distance ranging from below the threshold for HB (<3.2) and substantially above the threshold (up to 6). The deprotonation of E89 eliminates the constant fluctuation of the E89-S116 distance (Figure S3B, supplementary material, left panel, red trace) but large fluctuations still occur for several time intervals increases, however when the distance falls below the threshold the fluctuation decreases drastically (0.12 with E89(\u22121) vs. 0.68 with E89(0)) (Figure S3B, supplementary material). The distance between E89 and the Lys residues on the \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif is virtually unaffected by the protonation of E89 (Figure S3B, supplementary material). This is because the relatively stable formation of the HB with S116 prevents E89(\u22121) from forming the SB with the lysine residues. The combination of these results does not fully explain the effects on the contour area of the aperture of the interior cavity. This area remains small and substantially closed (Figure S3B, supplementary material), but the deprotonation of E89 increases its values significantly (from 150 11 to 386 31). This effect is not prompted by a transition of the EF loop. Instead, it appears to be prompted by a movement of the CD loop (Figure S5, supplementary material) which undergoes a similar transition to the one expected for the EF loop whereby the top of the loop goes from parallel to the entrance of the cavity to rotating to a position perpendicular to it. The increase in this area can also be observed in Figure S10 (supplementary material). In summary, the deprotonation of E89 in 3BLG does not prompt conformational changes that reproduce the postulated Tanford transition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30043, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The 1BSQ entry shows a different behavior. Throughout the 200 ns simulation the W19-L87 distance with E89(0) fluctuates around its initial value (Figure S3B, supplementary material, blue trace) and has an average value of 18.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u00c5 (range 16.6-21.4 \u00c5). Conversely, with E89(\u22121) 1BSQ shows a step-wise (< 1 ns) change at approximately ~ 2.5 ns into the simulation. The transition changes the W19-L87 distance from an average value of 19.5 \u00b1 0.8 \u00c5 to an average value of 22.6 \u00b1 0.7 \u00c5. This conformation is maintained for the remainder of the simulation (Figure S3B, supplementary material, red trace). However, as one observes in Figure S5 (supplementary material) the change in distance is not caused by the expected hinging motion of the EF loop around the D85-E89 axis (Figure 3). Instead, the EF loop twists clockwise while maintaining its folding parallel to the entrance of the cavity (Figure S5, supplementary material). Remarkably, but not unexpectedly, the profile of the E89-S116 HB distance shows the same step-wise profile at the same time points of the W19-L87 distance (Figure S3B, supplementary material, red trace). This clearly indicates that the changes are due to the breaking of the HB between E89 and S116 which allows the EF loop to rotate clockwise (Figure S5, supplementary material). As Figure S3B (supplementary material) shows, the E89-K69 distance shows a dramatic change transitioning from a fluctuating distance (14.4 1.1) well above the threshold for the formation of a salt bridge (established at 5.5 according to the parameters used by VMD) to locking into a distance near or below the threshold for salt a bridge (average 4.1 0.8) (Figure S3B, supplementary material, red trace). It is interesting to notice that this salt bridge does not immediately replace the HB. A step-wise transition in the E89-K69 distance is observed at the same point (~ 2.5 ns) where the transition of the E89-S116 distance occurs (Figure S3B, supplementary material, red trace), however the step only decreases the E89-K69 distance from an average distance of 18.4 1.2 to and average distance of 8.6 1.4 which is above the threshold for the formation of the salt bridge and (as the standard deviation indicates) is still subject to large fluctuation (Figure S3B, supplementary material, red trace). The formation of the salt bridge is delayed until ~ 53 ns into the simulation (Figure S3B, supplementary material, red trace). The combination of these changes does not appear to modify the area of the aperture to the interior cavity. With E89(0) the area gradually decreases even further from the initial conditions (which already represented a closed conformation) (Figure S3B, supplementary material, blue trace). With E89(\u22121) one notices an abrupt decrease in the accessible area at the time the E89-K69 salt bridge is formed (Figure S3B, supplementary material, red trace). Thus when E89 is deprotonated the clockwise rotation of the EF loop that would increase the aperture of the interior cavity is compensated by the formation of the E89-K69 salt bridge causing effectively causing a decrease of the entrance area to ~ 0.6 of the value of the aperture with protonated E89. Therefore, 1BSQ also does not show the conformational modification postulated for the Tanford transition upon deprotonation of E89.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 33379, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The remaining three entries 1DV9, 1CJ5 and 4LZU, however, are the ones showing the most interesting results and features that are consistent with the Tanford transition as it has been postulated. The W19-L87 distance increases substantially upon deprotonation of E89 (red traces in Figure 4 right panel and Figure S3C, supplementary material) whereas with E89(0) the values fluctuate around the starting distance (blue traces in Figure 4 right panel and Figure S3C, supplementary material). In 1CJ5 the transition (from 20.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 to 30.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u00c5) (Figure S3C, supplementary material, red trace) occurs gradually over a period of ~ 50 ns and the new configuration is maintained until the end of the simulation. In 1DV9 the transition is instead sharp (< 2 ns) and occurs at ~15 ns into the simulation (Figure S3C, supplementary material, red trace). The L87-W19 distance transitions from 22.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u00c5 to 26.2 \u00b1 0.8 \u00c5 and maintains such configuration until the end of the simulation. Contrary to the other cases, 4LZU shows a late transition of the L87-W19 distance. The transition is sharp (~ 1 ns) and occurs at ~ 170 ns from the start (Figure 4, right panel, red trace).

As the W19-L87 distance gradually increases in 1CJ5, so does the E89-S116 distance. Unlike the E89(0) case (Figure S3C, supplementary material, left panel, blue trace) where the HB is maintained throughout the simulation, E89(\u22121) disrupts the HB from the start (Figure S3C, supplementary material, left panel, red trace) as the distance remains well above the threshold for the formation of HB and further increases in lockstep to the increase of the W19-L87 distance. In 4LZU the sharp transition of the W19-L87 distance is mirrored by the increase in the E89-S116 distance. As seen in Figure 4 (left panel) in this case the increase also implies the breaking of the HB between E89 and S116. Unlike the case of 1BSQ discussed earlier, the swap of the HB with S116 with the salt bridge with K69 is immediate. This correlation exists in 1CJ5 as well. However while the increase of the W19-L87 distance and the E89-S116 HB breakage occurs gradually, the formation of the E89-K60 (not K69) salt bridge is sudden and occurs simultaneously with the start of the increase of the W19-L87 distance. In 1DV9 the transition of the W19-L87 distance correlates with a large fluctuation of the E89-S116 HB (Figure S3C, supplementary material, right panel). However, the HB is re-established and is not broken until ~ 60 ns after the transition of the W19-L87 (Figure S3C, right panel).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 36251, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The effects of the deprotonation of E89 on the area at the entrance of the interior cavity are quite significant. With E89(0) the area remains substantially unchanged in 4LZU (Figure 4, right panel, blue trace) at 380 40 consistent with the EF maintaining its closed conformation over the entrance of the interior cavity (Figure 6). In 1CJ5 one notices a drift in the value of the area from 288 31 in the first 2 ns to 353 16 in the last 2 ns of the simulation which could be due to a movement of the base of the EF loop which maintains its closed conformation but distances from the AB loop across the entrance of the cavity (Figure S4, supplementary material). A similar drift can also be noticed in 1DV9 whereby the area increases from 234 42 in the first 2 ns to 380 37 in the last 2 ns (Figure S3C, supplementary material). Conversely, in all entries the presence of E89(\u22121) causes a significant increase of the area at the entrance of the interior cavity. In 1CJ5 the increase is gradual and mirrors the time profile of the W19-L87 distance. The effect is to increase the area from 395 24 in the 5 ns before the slow transition to 695 49 in the last 5 ns of the simulation (Figure S3C, supplementary material, bottom, left panel), a 76% increase. Figure S5 (supplementary material) clearly shows the EF loop that rotates and stretches orthogonal to the entrance of the cavity. However, this conformational change is accompanied by the twisting of the \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif (Figure S5, supplementary material, circled in red) which is due to the formation of the E89-K60 salt bridge. These effects can be better appreciated in Figure S9 where one observes that the increase in the accessibility of the interior cavity prompted by the transition of the EF loop is moderated by the formation of the E89-K60 salt bridge. The effect of E89(\u22121) on the accessibility of the interior cavity is displayed also by 4LZU. In this case the area transitions in a step-wise manner at the same time as the E89-S116 HB breaks and the E89-K69 salt bridge is formed. The increase in the area is very dramatic, from 525 32 in the 5 ns before the slow transition to 728 41 in the last 5 ns of the simulation (Figure 4, right panel, red trace). The rotation of the EF loop is clearly seen in Figure 6 where one also notices that, unlike 1CJ5, the \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif remains virtually unaffected by the conformational transition. On the other hand Figure 7 shows the clear increase in accessibility of the interior cavity. In 1DV9 the increase in area is similar between the entry with E89(0) and the entry with E89(\u22121) (Figure S3C, supplementary material, right panel, Figures S8 and S9, supplementary material) despite the evident transition of the EF loop (Figure 6). With E89(0) the increase is not due to a conformational transition of the EF loop and is entirely due to the movement of the side chain (not the backbone) of L87 which moves perpendicular to the entrance of the cavity (Figure S8, supplementary material). With E89(\u22121) the contour area shows a more complex behavior. At the step-wise transition of the W19-L87 distance (the EF loop conformational transition) with E89(\u22121) there is a corresponding sudden increase in the contour area of the interior cavity (Figure S3C, supplementary material, right panel) from 301 67 to ~ 864 83. However, this initial step-wise decrease which corresponds to a first breaking of the E89-S116 HB, is then followed by a gradual decrease when the E89-K69 salt bridge is formed (Figure S3C, supplementary material, right panel). The formation of the salt bridge leads to a final contour area to 472 27. One also notices another contribution to the gradual decrease of the contour area. The formation of the E89-K69 bridge (Figure S9 vs. Figure S8, supplementary material) prompts a large distortion of \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif (Figure 5) which is \u2018pulled\u2019 closer to both the AB loop and the \u03b2E-EF loop-\u03b2F motif across from the entrance of the cavity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 40253, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The results of our simulations show some novel and interesting results in both groups. Group 1 includes entries at alkaline or neutral pH that have the backbone of the EF loop oriented nearly perpendicular to the entrance of the interior cavity and have adopted an open conformation. In this case one expects that the neutralization of E89 would prompt a transition from the open to the closed conformation of the EF loop. This, however appears to occur only with the 1BSY entry (Figures S6, supplementary material & S3A, left panel). The 2BLG entry does not show any substantial transition, whereas 3NPO shows a peculiar transition. In fact, it is E89(\u22121), not E89(0), that causes the EF loop to undergo a transition to the closed conformation (Figure S3A, supplementary material, right panel and Figure S7, supplementary material). This is opposite to what is expected from the postulated mechanism of the Tanford transition. Conversely, group 2 includes entries at acidic or neutral pH with the EF loop rotated towards the middle of the entrance of the interior cavity in a closed conformation. One expects that in this case the deprotonation of E89 triggers the Tanford transition that involves the rotation of the EF loop. This is indeed the case with, however, a noteworthy exception: 3BLG. In this entry, the substitution of E89(0) with E89(\u22121) does not produce remarkable transitions in any of the key parameters associated with the rotation of the EF loop to an open conformation (W19-L87, E89-S116 and E89-K69/K60 distance or the area at the entrance of the cavity). On the contrary, albeit to various extents, in the other entries of this group (1CJ5, 1DV9, 4LZU and 1BSQ) deprotonation of E89 does prompt the rotation of the EF loop that one associates with the Tanford transition. Why is 3BLG the outlier in this group? We propose that the reason for the isolated behavior of 3BLG is the position of the side chain of E89 with respect to the EF loop. In this group, 3BLG is the only entry where the side chain of E89 is outside the interior cavity (Figure S1, supplementary material) and away from the EF loop. This probably causes the structure to be less sensitive to the changes in the net charge of this amino acid. In the other entries, instead, the position of the side chain of E89 is either closer or directly below the EF loop (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material) so that the presence of a net negative charge in the amino acid may induce electrostatic repulsion that prompts the EF loop to distance itself from the entrance of the cavity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 42831, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Other time traces provide key novel information related to the conformational transition of the EF loop. In all cases in which the EF loop undergoes a rotation from a closed to an open configuration the HB between E89-S116 breaks. Given the evidence that this event can occur with some delay (up to 65 ns) from the rotation of the loop, indicates that the breaking of this bond is not the trigger to the Tanford transition. A novel finding is that the cleavage of the HB with S116 prompts E89 to \u2018lock\u2019 into a salt bridge with K69 or K60 across the entrance of the bridge. This effect is only possible in the entries where the side chain of E89 is oriented inward and does not occur when the side chain is oriented outward (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material). Although replacing the HB with the salt bridge is energetically favorable (~ 1.25 kcal/mol) the replacement does not always happen simultaneously with the cleavage of the E89-S116 HB. The formation of the salt bridge has two consequential effects: 1) the distortion of the \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif and 2) the limitation of the opening of the interior cavity. The first effect includes a twisting of the motif that rotates the CD loop counterclockwise and moves it into the entrance of the interior cavity (Figure 5, top and Figure S5, supplementary material). This movement also loosens the contact between \u03b2D and \u03b2E and cause the disruption of the latter (as seen in 1CJ5, but also to some extent in 1DV9 and 4LZU Table S2A and S2B, supplementary material). The area of the accessible entrance to the cavity increases when the EF loop rotates into an open conformation, however the movement of the CD loop as well as the creation of the bridge across the entrance of the interior cavity limit the aperture of the cavity. Therefore, even though the EF loop transition upon deprotonation of E89 would open the entrance of the cavity the salt bridge between E89 and the lysines in the CD loop and \u03b2D as well as the ensuing distortion of the \u03b2C-CD loop-\u03b2D motif effectively moderate the extent of the area of the entrance of the cavity that is actually available.

The \u2018reverse\u2019 Tanford transition creates contact between L87 and P38/L39 (Figure 7) which is aided by a protrusion of the AB loop into the entrance of the interior cavity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47435, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Group 2: E89(0)", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47451, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The survey at the beginning of the simulation reveals contour areas that range from ~ 228 to ~ 395, in agreement with the closed conformation of structures obtained under acidic conditions (Figure 7 and Figure S9, supplementary material). The only exception is 1BSQ where the contact between the AB loop and the GH loop is less compact so that the contour area extends to include the P144 residue of the C-terminal (Figure S8, supplementary material). As a result, despite the contact between the AB and the EF loops, a relatively large contour area (~ 560) remains (Table 2 and Figure S8, supplementary material). In the 3BLG entry the AB loop protrudes into the entrance of the cavity to the point of interacting with the EF loop (Figure S10, supplementary material) and is reflected by this entry having the lowest starting contour area (228). Figures S4 and S8 (supplementary material) show that, although the EF loop maintains a closed conformation throughout the simulations, the P38/L39 and the L87/N88 residues separate. The separation, however does not provide a substantial increase of the entrance to the cavity. In 1BSQ, the contact between the AB loop and the GH loop is re-compacted and, in addition, a HB is formed between E89 and K60 that brings the \u03b2C-CD Loop-\u03b2D closer to the AB and EF loops with the effect of decreasing the contour area of the interior cavity (~ 200, Figure S8, supplementary material). In 1CJ5 the P38:N88 contact is replaced with a A37:N88 contact that maintains the AB loop protruded and in contact with the EF loop maintaining a small contour area (~280) of the cavity. In 4LZU the protrusion of the AB loop remains, but the K60:E89 contact breaks, creating an increase in the contour area of the entrance of the cavity (to ~ 400, Figure S8, supplementary material and Table 4).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 49277, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Group 2: E89(\u22121)", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 49296, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The starting conformations of 1BSQ shows an increased distancing between the AB loop and the EF loop compared to the case of E89(0). This creates a narrow opening of the interior cavity with a contour area of ~ 470 (Figure S9, supplementary material). Similar to the protonated conditions, the other entries (Figures 7 and S9) show the contact between L39 or P38 and L87 (or N88 for 3BLG and 1DV9) and contour areas ranging between 220 and 470. As we discussed earlier, in this group two of the entries (1BSQ and 3BLG) do not undergo the conformational change of the EF loop postulated by the Tanford transition whereas the other entries do (Figures S3B and S5, supplementary material) and these changes can be observed in the contour area of the entrance of the interior cavity. As shown earlier, in 1BSQ the EF loop rotates clockwise but remains basically parallel to the entrance of the cavity, thus in a closed conformation (Figures S5 and S9, supplementary material). The rotation increases the distance between L87 (EF loop) and P38 (AB loop). However, the formation of the salt bridge with K60 which is at the base of the CD loop effectively contributes to reduce the contour area of the interior cavity. This is further decreased by the rotation of the GH loop that allows N109 to protrude into the entrance of the cavity (Figure S9, supplementary material). This rotation is likely the effect of the cleavage of the E89-S116 HB followed by the formation of the salt bridge between E89 and K60. Cleaving the HB allows S116 to distance from the EF loop and at the same time the formation of the salt bridge causes E89 to \u2018pull\u2019 \u03b2G and effectively cause N109 at the base of the GH loop to protrude into the entrance of the cavity. In 3BLG the changes are even more subtle. Only notable are the distancing of P38 in the AB loop from L87 in the EF loop and the rotation of the side chain of N88 from a position parallel to the entrance of the cavity to one that is nearly perpendicular to it. In 1CJ5 the conformational transition of the EF loop (Figure 7 and Figure S9, supplementary material) breaks the contact between the AB and the EF loops and creates a larger opening. However, the increase in contour area of the entrance of the cavity is affected by the formation of the K60:E89 salt bridge and the rotation of the GH loop into towards the interior of the cavity which limits the increase in access area. Thus, although the conformational change of the EF loop occurs and produces an open conformation with the loop oriented perpendicular to the entrance of the cavity, the contour area only increases by ~ 100 which is less than the other two entries 4LZU and 1DV9 that undergo the same transition. In 1DV9 the EF loop undergoes the same transition (Figure 5) which also does not translate into a large increase of the opening of the entrance of the cavity. In part this is an effect of the formation of the K69:E89 salt bridge but for this entry another effect occurs. The conformational change of the EF loop includes a clockwise rotation that allows contact between L31 in the AB loop and N109 in the GH loop (Figure S9) which can be explained by the \u2018swap\u2019 between the E89-S116 HB with the E89-K60 salt bridge discussed for 1BSQ. Thus the contour of the cavity becomes delimited by the K69-E89 and the L31-109 pairs (Figure S9). The 4LZU entry is the one that shows the most dramatic effect. As discussed section 3.4.2 (Figure 5) 4LZU with E89(\u22121) shows the same conformational change of the EF loop as the other entries of this group, but the increase in the contour area of the rim of the cavity is much more significant. (Figures 4 and 7). In this case E89 forms a salt bridge with K69 (not K60) allowing for the larger increase in the contour area because K69 is located in \u03b2D instead of the end of \u03b2C. The formation of this salt bridge also contributes to make the rotation of the GH loop less extensive because \u03b2G does not have to move as much to \u2018follow\u2019 the pull of the E89 residue towards the opposite side of the cavity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 53363, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 53374, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Overall, this works presents a detailed analysis of the simulated effects of the protonation state of E89 on the pH-dependent conformational change of the EF loop of several PDB entries of BLG as a function of its orientation relative to the entrance of the cavity. We believe this the first example of reproducing the details of the transition using an in silico approach over a time scale that allows to observe the transition of the protein from one stable conformation to another. Two groups of entries were investigated: group 1 where the entries include structures collected under slight or strong alkaline conditions with the initial conformation of the EF loop perpendicular to the entrance of the interior cavity (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material) (i.e. an open conformation according to the paradigm of the Tanford transition), and group 2 where the entries include structures obtained at neutral or acidic pH with the initial conformation of the EF loop parallel to the entrance of the interior cavity (Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material) (i.e. a closed conformation according to the paradigm of the Tanford transition). Experimentally resolved structures, such as the ones used in this study, have allowed to postulate that the protonation state of E89 regulates the access to the interior cavity (\u03b2-barrel) of BLG by prompting the rotation of the EF loop from the closed to the open conformation (Figure 3). These \u2018snapshots\u2019, however do not provide evidence for the dynamics of the changes or for the actual role of the net charge of E89 in triggering the transition. Our simulations show that E89(\u22121) indeed provides the trigger to the transition of the EF loop and that the rearrangement of the loop reproduces the Tanford transition. However we have also shown that the transition only occurs under certain circumstances and involve other motifs within the protein. The most important finding of our simulations is that deprotonation of E89 is not a sufficient condition for the transition to occur. In fact only three of the five entries among the acidic group (1CJ5, 1DV9 and 4LZU) undergo the transition when E89 becomes negatively charged. What is the common feature among these three structures that is not occurring in the other two (3BLG and 1BSQ)? Our results reveal that the orientation of the side chain of E89 is key to prompt the transition. When the side chain of E89 is located underneath the closed EF loop (1CJ5, 1DV9 and 4LZU, Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material) the transition occurs. Conversely, when the side chain is positioned to the outside of the protein (3BLG Figure 1 and Figure S1, supplementary material) or towards the GH loop (3BLG Figures 1 and S1) E89(\u22121) does not prompt the rearrangement of the EF loop (Figure 7 and Figure S7, supplementary material). In the alkaline group one would expect that the opposite change, from E89(\u22121) to E89(0), would trigger the reverse transition (i.e. from open to closed). This appears to occur only in 1BSY while in 3NPO the opposite of the expected effect occurs.
