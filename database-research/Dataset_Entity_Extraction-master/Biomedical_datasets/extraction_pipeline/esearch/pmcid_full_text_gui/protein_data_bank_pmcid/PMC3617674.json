However, its detailed structural interaction mechanism for eliciting the immune response is still not clear. One hypothesis proposes an induction of conformational changes in the TR/pMH interface. In this context the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the TR play a major role: The centrally located and hypervariable CDR3 loops are the most structurally diverse CDR and mainly recognize the peptides presented by the MH (for a standardized nomenclature see). In contrast, the CDR1 and CDR2 loops mainly recognize the rather conserved \u03b1-helices of the MH. Hence, beside the presented peptide, these \u03b1-helices are of major interest for recognition by the TR. In this context the question arises how these \u03b1-helices can be characterized in a convenient way to allow further detailed investigations and comparisons. For the stationary case sequence-based methods, sequence-based methods with illustration on three-dimensional images or two-dimensional sequence-based methods exist. However, these methods are not satisfactory, if one adds structural and even dynamical aspects, as for example provided by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Currently several hundred experimentally derived structures of pMH (bound or not to TR) are available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and annotated in IMGT\u00ae/3Dstructure-Data Bank, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae . Most of them have roughly the same overall structure: A binding groove (G) flanked by two \u03b1-helices. However, these helices differ in their overall structure and/or in subtle arrangements. Although both helices depend on MH class I (MH1) and MH class II (MH2) classes, genes and alleles, especially the latter depends on different peptides bound to the MH and on different TR binding characteristics.

However, in this study several scientific challenges had to be addressed. The first question was to find an appropriate coordinate representation: We formulated a vector-valued function in parametric form consisting of polynomials and polynomial splines, since these functions are continuously differentiable. In our first approach we fitted the curves through coordinates of the \u03b1-helix obtained from the PDB. This procedure had the disadvantage that the approximations of the different \u03b1-helices were not comparable to each other, since the rotation and translation of the molecule complexes differ. In our second approach we used a rotation matrix to transform the \u03b1-helix into the diagonal of the Cartesian coordinate system. The advantage of this approach in comparison to our first fit was that the stationary structures were comparable to each other. However, in MD simulations we lost this advantage again, due to the movement over time. Consequently, in our third approach, we applied PCA to obtain a local coordinate system. After we established the different models with polynomials and splines with 1 or 2 nodes in combination with polynomials of degree 1 to 7 yielding 21 models on the basis of the PC, we used the cAIC to determine the most appropriate model for our \u03b1-helix.

However, during a MD simulation \u03b1-helices undergo conformational changes, which could not be represented by splines with nodes in a convenient way. One might consider further improvements for our splines. Instead of using equidistant nodes, the definition of the nodes at the kink points would be an improvement in the stationary case. The models would fit the \u03b1-helix more precisely. However, in the dynamic case one would have to define the nodes based on the first frame, yielding a very good model for this frame but not necessarily for others. During the simulation the kinks of the \u03b1-helix could shift, whereas the predefined nodes are fixed. This problem can be solved by redetermination of the nodes in every time step according to shifts of the kinks. This would lead to another more general approach where a dynamic search of the number of nodes and the location of these in each time step would be necessary. However, this redefinition would make the comparison over time difficult and lead to an exponential increase in computational time, rendering this approach impractical for longer MD trajectories.
