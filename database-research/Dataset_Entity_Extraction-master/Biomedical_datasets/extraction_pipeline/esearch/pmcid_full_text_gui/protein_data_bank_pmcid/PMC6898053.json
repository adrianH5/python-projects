Contact maps and the related techniques of constraint-based structure reconstruction can be considered as unifying aspects of both processes. We present the Structural Relevance (SR) score which quantifies the information content of individual contacts and residues in the context of the whole native structure. The physical process of protein folding is commonly characterized with spatial and temporal resolution: some residues are Early Folding while others are Highly Stable with respect to unfolding events. We employ the proposed SR score to demonstrate that folding initiation and structure stabilization are subprocesses realized by distinct sets of residues. The example of cytochrome c is used to demonstrate how StructureDistiller identifies the most important contacts needed for correct protein folding. This shows that entries of a contact map are not equally relevant for structural integrity. The proposed StructureDistiller algorithm identifies contacts with the highest information content; these entries convey unique constraints not captured by other contacts. Identification of the most informative contacts effectively doubles resilience toward contacts which are not observed in the native contact map.

The connection of protein sequence and structure is unclear and constitutes the protein folding problem. One promising technique to gain detailed insights into the process of protein folding (Fig.\u00a01) are pulse-labeling hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments. In the process of protein folding, a denatured protein chain adopts a native, functional conformation. HDX allows to study the process with spatial and temporal resolution and folding events of particular residues can be related to particular time steps. Early Folding Residues (EFR, blue in Fig.\u00a01) initiate the formation of stable local structures starting from the denatured protein chain. In contrast, Highly Stable Residues (HSR, green in Fig.\u00a01) constitute regions in the native conformation which are resilient to unfolding events (e.g. as natural phenomenon or change in temperature or pH). Both EFR and HSR are key aspects to understand the protein folding process; standardized data is provided by the Start2Fold database. The defined-pathway model was proposed based on these observations. It considers protein folding to be a deterministic process where defined regions initiate the folding process and fragments assemble stepwise to form the native conformation by establishing tertiary contacts. EFR constitute the folding nucleus and seem to determine the order in which certain sequence fragment fold. However, the relevance of EFR on the structural integrity of a protein structure is little explored. One reason is that it is currently not possible to assess the role of a contact or residue regarding the structural integrity of a protein; especially an in silico approach suitable for large-scale studies is needed to assess the relevance of EFR and HSR.

False positive predictions (i.e. non-native contacts not observed in the native structure of a protein) are common. They have detrimental effects on the usefulness of contact maps. Peculiarly, such false positive predictions are difficult to spot and in reconstruction they impair the feasibility of all other contacts. Thus, dedicated methods were designed to validate contact maps. Other studies tried to elucidate the optimal contact definition by assessing its influence on reconstruction performance. Commonly, contacts stabilizing secondary structure elements (i.e. residues separated by less than six positions on sequence level) are ignored in the context of contact maps.

In 2007, Chen et al. pioneered the search for the most relevant contacts of a contact map and wanted to determine the minimal set of contacts which captures the fold of a protein. Therefore, they represented proteins by contact maps and selected random subsets with varying coverage. These subsets were then used as constraints in a structure reconstruction algorithm, the result was aligned to the native structure, and its fidelity was assessed by the root-mean square deviation (RMSD). As the number of constraints increased (i.e. more contacts of the native contact map are considered), the RMSD decreased because the reconstructs resembled the native structure increasingly well. A reconstruction is considered successful when the RMSD to the native structure is below a certain threshold and likely to resemble the correct fold: in our study, we use the threshold of 4.0\u2009\u00c5 by Marks et al.. Good reconstructions have been shown to depend on a delicate balance of sequentially neighbored and sequentially separated contacts. Sathyapriya et al. extended the study of Chen et al. and coined the term structural essence for the minimal set of fold defining contacts. They demonstrated that 8% of all contacts allow for the reconstruction of the correct fold of a protein because most information in a contact map is redundant. Furthermore, a rational selection of contacts can outperform a random selection of equally many contacts with respect to reconstruction quality. However, such a configuration is difficult to compose.

Additionally, the relevance of EFR and HSR in the context of protein structure prediction provides qualitative insights. Several studies identified a small number of key residues for the in vitro folding process. It has also been shown that the information content of experimentally determined NMR restraints varies drastically.

For a long time, in silico folding simulations improved the understanding of the protein folding process, potentially contact maps provide an even more tangible connection of both aspects.

We argue that constraint-based reconstruction algorithms such as CONFOLD can access this information when employed in a modified setting. Using structures deposited in the PDB archive, native contact map representations of all proteins were computed (consult the method section for details). All-atom models can be reconstructed from these reduced representations using CONFOLD. The fidelity of these reconstructs was assessed by a structure alignment to the native structure and is considered the reconstruction error. The average RMSD of these reconstructions approaches 2\u2009\u00c5 (Fig.\u00a03), as described in literature. Detailed identifiers and results are given in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01 which also shows that no successful reconstructions could be achieved for Start2Fold entry STF0009 (PDB:1a64_A). In general, knowledge of 100% of entries in the native contact map leads to good reconstructs which resemble the native structure (Fig.\u00a03). Structural constraints are redundant and, thus, it is not possible to directly assess the information conveyed by a single contact. Therefore, we decreased the coverage of the native contact map in 5% steps which leads to an increase in reconstruction error. Sparse contact maps using a random selection of 5% of all contacts do not yield good reconstructs below the threshold of 4\u2009\u00c5 for which the reconstruct would successfully resemble the native fold. The reconstruction process using more contacts becomes more robust as the distributions decrease in variance.

A contact is removed from the selection if it is present in the random selection of 30% of all contacts (and added otherwise) and so-called toggle reconstructs are computed for this slightly changed contact maps. Similar to the approach of Nabuurs et al., the information content of a contact is the decrease in RMSD which knowledge of a particular contact provides in relation to the absence of that contact. Supplementary Figure\u00a01 shows that the optimal coverage is structure-specific and the determined default value of 30% is not generally the best choice, as also discussed in literature. It would be possible to address this issue by determining the structure-specific value (e.g. sample a range of numbers and determine when reconstructs with RMSD below 4.0\u2009\u00c5 or TM-scores above 0.5 are achieved) and using this value for all subsequent calculations.

It is remarkable that contacts of EFR show no increase in SR despite their presumed role for the protein folding process. A possible interpretation is that EFR primarily define stable, local structures due to their occurrence in sequence regions associated to high backbone rigidity. They form defined sequence regions with fewer possible backbone conformations and produce pivotal secondary structure elements. Therefore, EFR define the folding nucleus of a protein and sequentially encode the ordered secondary structure elements formed first.

These stable, local structures may be secondary structure elements or larger autonomously folding units also referred to as foldons. In a stepwise process, such local structures will subsequently establish tertiary contacts and assemble the native conformation of a protein. The employed reconstruction method directly considers secondary structure elements, which are used to derive additional constraints. Therefore, most secondary structure elements should be represented successfully which may explain why we observe long-range contacts to be particularly important for structural integrity.

Our study demonstrates that native contacts in a protein structure are not of equal importance for the reconstruction of the tertiary structure from this reduced representation. Similar observations have been made for NMR constraints. StructureDistiller allows a more fine-grained analysis of contact maps and may pinpoint properties of contacts which can be associated with high Structural Relevance. Contacts of high Structural Relevance tend to be unique contacts for which no redundant backup exists as it is the case for the contact between two \u03a9-loops in cytochrome c. The importance of this contact for the structural integrity also implies that high Structural Relevance scores may capture crucial positions for structure stability as shown by Highly Stable Residues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42167, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The proposed strategy depends on some crucial assumptions and provides a number of points open for investigation in further studies. Residues in a protein are covalently bound and constraints on a residue will also affect neighboring residues. Thus, residue-specific information as complex as the Structural Relevance score should not be considered the absolute truth. One of the most delicate aspects when handling contact maps is the used contact definition. Particularly, the distance-based contact definition employed in this study does not imply chemically relevant contacts between atoms (such as hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions). The chosen cutoff is rather strict and will ignore some meaningful contacts; a relaxation of this cutoff will encompass more contacts but also increases computation time. Our setup explicitly provides secondary structure information during reconstruction which has been shown to improve performance in general and allows employing this rather strict contact definition as well as ignoring contacts between sequence neighbors (with a sequence separation <6). In consequence, a personal computer can handle the needed computations but no direct comparison to other reconstruction algorithms is possible due to the secondary structure-specific set of used constraints directly depending on CONFOLD. Also, it is natural that CONFOLD, TM-align, and the RMSD as chosen distance measure have an effect on the computed scores and may introduce some form of bias. It would be invaluable to adapt the proposed strategy to other reconstruction algorithms such as Reconstruct or C2S and demonstrate the validity of StructureDistiller in a different setup. It is also an open question to what degree the most informative contacts identified in this study are also useful for independent reconstruction algorithms. The TM-score may be more suited to score reconstructs because it is independent of protein length. Another advantage of the TM-score is that it is easy to interpret, especially in the context of deciding whether a reconstruct successfully resembles the fold of the native structure. TM-scores are provided as alternative output score for the Structural Relevance. We chose the RMSD value to present results because the majority of readers is familiar with the score and it also provides a direct way to compare results of this study with that of previous publications. The TM-score correlates well with the RMSD (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a03) and the nature of the findings does not change when the TM-score is considered for analysis. Furthermore, the decision to use 30% of all native contacts to compute the Structural Relevance score is not generally applicable and if more suitable structure-specific values are known they should be used instead. The StructureDistiller algorithm may be improved by determining for each protein structure individually where the sweet spot lies between meaningful reconstructs and maximized sensitivity. Finally, our approach aims at quantifying the information conveyed by a single contact for the integrity of the whole structure.

This constitutes a novel contribution of the toolkit available for the interpretation of contact maps and protein structures in general, while making the connection of contact maps and tertiary structure more concrete. Maybe the protein folding problem is not solvable without understanding how protein structures can be predicted reliably. In fact, both problems are often described to be two sides of the same coin and structure prediction did provide new insights into the folding process before. Additional tools are needed to make the connection of protein sequence and structure more tangible and StructureDistiller provides just that. The algorithm allows for a novel fine-grained interpretation of contact maps and may improve their interpretability.
