Discriminating causative genes within such intervals is often deeply problematical, and the amount of heritable variation explained by these loci tends to be small. Similarly, regions of copy number variation (CNV) might include large numbers of genes within the minimum region of overlap between patients, and it is difficult to attribute changes in dosage of specific genes within the interval to aspects of the overall phenotype.

Complementary phenotype data is available through the database of the WTSI Mouse Genetics Programme (MGP) mouse resource portal (MRP; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal/). To date, primary pipeline phenotypes are available for 372 lines and 290 lines have been characterised for their phenotypes under infection challenges. Phenotyping under challenge is an area under active development and one which is likely to be increasingly important in establishing the phenotypic repertoire of mutants. The WTSI MGP phenotyping pipelines contain two challenges, one for infection challenge using Citrobacter and Salmonella, and a second for high fat diet.

The breadth of these, predominantly in vivo, assays is key to the pipeline approach, which is designed to detect a wide spectrum of phenotypes ranging, for example, from behaviour to dysmorphology, clinical chemistry and immune responses. The pipelines currently under discussion for the IMPC are shown in Figure 3 and discussed below. The complexity of phenotypes assayed is directly proportional to the cost and inversely proportional to throughput; as assays become more labour-intensive, the number of mice that can feasibly be examined decreases. This then requires the stratification of assays into primary, secondary and tertiary phenotyping efforts, whereby mice from the primary pipeline are selected for additional in-depth analysis on the basis of phenotypes uncovered in the first battery of assays. In EuroPhenome the current dataset contains significant annotations (phenodeviants) for clinical chemistry (more than 100 strains), haematology (92), body weight (61), behaviour (modified SHIRPA (SmithKline Beecham, Harwell, Imperial College, Royal London Hospital, Phenotype Assessment)) (52), to give some idea of the highest assay hit rates.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31478, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31525, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With the completion of the IKMC project the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) was launched in September 2012 with the aim of phenotyping 20, 000 mutant lines from the IKMC resource.

Given that the genomic and phenotypic coverage of the current mouse dataset are limited, the contribution to classification can only be expected to increase as data flows from the IMPC efforts together with further hypothesis driven research.

Four mouse phenotypes were identified that were each significantly enriched among all DD-associated CNVRs.

How important this is on a genomic scale remains to be seen \u2013 a question that can only be even approached when we have the genome-wide survey of phenotypes promised by the IMPC. A survey by Liao and Zhang suggested that >20% of essential human genes are non-essential in the mouse. Whilst essentiality is something of an acid test, the problem with attempting to make this comparison is confounded by the differing effects of modifiers and background on lethality and that most of the mouse data is based on a range of inbred lines, many of which show differences in the essentiality of specific mutant alleles themselves. Comparing this rather heterogeneous data with known confounding factors with human clinical data it is rather surprising that we find a concordance as high as 80%, suggesting that the true figure may be much higher. Patterns of gene expression are also well-conserved; this was indicated by the study of Liao and Zhang and consistent with the global study of mouse and man carried out by Zheng-Bradley et al who found that global patterns of tissue-specific expression of orthologous genes are conserved in human and mouse and that expression of groups of orthologous genes co-varies in the two species.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42820, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Phenotype-based candidate gene discovery", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42861, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The ability to establish candidate genes for a phenotype, for example looking for genes for rare diseases or prioritizing candidates for pathogenicity using only phenotypic data, has been hampered by the problem of comparing different phenotypes in different organisms, both because of lack of common semantics but also because of intrinsic differences between the way often fundamentally common phenotypes can be expressed in the different organisms. These issues are discussed in and. Two approaches have been taken to this; the first is to use a bridging terminology such a UMLS or MeSH. successfully used an approach involving lexical matching to map the MP ontology to UMLS permitting interrogation of OMIM and other clinical datasets using one of the more than 100 terminologies integrated into UMLS. However, more recently, an approach (termed EQ) using the matching of logical definitions of pre-composed phenotype ontologies has been developed which overcomes the intrinsic semantic problems in integrating phenotype ontologies from different species. In the EQ method, a phenotype is characterized by an affected Entity (from an anatomy or process ontology) and a Quality [from the Phenotype And Trait Ontology (PATO)) that specifies how the entity is affected. The affected entity can either be a biological function or process as specified in the Gene Ontology (GO), or an anatomical entity. Whilst the ontologies used to create the definitions are largely species-agnostic, such as GO, CheBI, MPATH, anatomical entities are almost exclusively specified using species-specific anatomy ontologies. In order to make mappings between these vertebrate anatomies the metazoan, species-independent UBERON ontology is used in constructing anatomically-based cross-products.

Efficient automated reasoning over the PhenomeNET is enabled through ontology modularization and design patterns for expressing phenotypes and their links to anatomy and physiology ontologies [Hoehndorf et al 2010, ]. Once data from the model organism databases is integrated into the network this allows the direct comparison of phenotypes of multiple species, and PhenomeNET is able to perform a pairwise comparison of phenotypes using a measure of semantic similarity.
