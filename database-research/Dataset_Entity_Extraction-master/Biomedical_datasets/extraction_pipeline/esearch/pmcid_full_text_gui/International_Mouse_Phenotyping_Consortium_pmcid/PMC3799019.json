The majority of the ES cell resources used by the IMPC are made in JM8-derived cell lines, which were originally derived from C57BL/6N embryos. To achieve the goal of producing and phenotyping mutant strains on an inbred genetic background, chimeras are bred to C57BL/6N (black) females. When an albino host blastocyst is used for chimera production this prohibits the assessment of germline transmission (GLT) using the coat color of G1 mice, and therefore all progeny of chimera matings must be biopsied and genotyped, with consequent ethical and cost/labor concerns. Although agouti or non-agouti host blastocysts can be used to aid subsequent color selection in certain combinations, their utility in high-throughput production is limited as they must be paired correctly with the agouti status of the injected ESC clone.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1768, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "During routine colony expansion a strain generated by the Sanger Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) (Colony ID: MDDH, EUCOMM ES cell clone EPD0176_3_A10 which carries the Stard7tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi allele) produced albino mice from the first intercross of germline animals.

This analysis revealed only 549 homozygous private single nucleotide variants (SNV) in both sequenced mice that were not present in the reference C57BL/6J genome, C57BL/6NJ, or in the genomes of 17 other laboratory mouse strains. Six hundred and forty six homozygous private indels, and 21 private structural variants (Table 1, Supporting Information Table 1) were also detected. We attempted to validate all 58 homozygous SNVs and 39 homozygous indel calls on Chr 7, which are linked to the TyrcWTSI deletion, using the Sequenom MassARRAY\u00ae platform. A total of 41/43 SNVs and 7/7 homozygous indels were validated, with the remainder of sites failing in the oligo design phase due to the repetitive nature of the flanking sequence (Supporting Information Table 2). An estimated false-discovery rate of 1.3% for SNVs was derived by the validation of a further 155/157 homozygous SNVs randomly selected from the rest of the genome. Some heterozygous variants were also detected (Table 1), however, the high number of false positive SNV calls (51/131) and indel calls (11/17) indicate that the majority of the heterozygous calls are likely due to artefacts resulting from read mapping to the reference genome. To assess the origin of the variants present on chromosome 7 we genotyped DNA from the EPD0176_3_A10 ES cell clone, the parental JM8N4 line, and C57BL/6N-Taconic, and compared these genotypes to calls made in C57BL/6N-TyrcWTSI (Supporting Information Table 2). This analysis revealed 31 variants (SNVs and indels) on chromosome 7 of C57BL/6N-TyrcWTSI that are shared with both the EPD0176_3_A10 ES cell clone and the JM8N4 parental cell line, but not C57BL/6N-Taconic. Two of the SNVs originating from the JM8N4 parental cell line were predicted to cause amino acid changes (K/M at AA 107 of Sult2a5 and G/E at AA 455 of Zfp74). A comparison of C57BL/6N-Taconic and C57BL/6N-TyrcWTSI revealed that only 6 SNVs and one indel on chromosome 7 originate from C57BL/6N-Taconic. We were able to validate 8 SNVs which are unique to C57BL/6N-TyrcWTSI. In addition to the TyrcWTSI deletion, only one other validated structural variant unique to C57BL/6N-TyrcWTSI was localized to chromosome 7; a 233bp homozygous insertion that fell within an intron of Leng8.

Because of the dominant effect of agouti, the resulting breeding to nonagouti wildtype mice means that all mice may still have to be genotyped in order to detect GLT as a small percentage of nonagouti mice may also carry the targeted mutation. To test this we analyzed 181 Sanger MGP colonies produced from JM8 agouti cell lines; 25 colonies (13%) produced only black mice at G1 and would therefore have been missed using only agouti color selection. In addition, from a total of 1,351 G1 het mice detected by PCR, 712 (52%) had a black coat color; thus limiting the detection to just agouti mice may also have a significant effect on colony expansion rates in a high-throughput project where a rapid turnaround of GLT to phenotyping is at a premium.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8441, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Following backcrossing the C57BL/6N-TyrcWTSI strain is almost identical to C57BL/6N-Taconic carrying just two variants that fall into coding sequence, 25 other single nucleotide variants on chromosome 7, and just one SV other than the TyrcWTSI deletion.
