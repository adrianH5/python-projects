Such highly specialized proteins can be found for example in the eye lens, where they provide optical properties to eye, or in cilia or myoblasts, where they provide unique structural and mechanical characteristics of the cells. One of the most striking examples is a set of enamel matrix proteins (EMPs), a group of highly specialized secreted proteins essential for orchestrating the biomineralization process during enamel formation in vertebrates. EMPs have a unique, essential function in amelogenesis in mammals regardless of their level of representation in amelogenesis.

The only exception are Amelx KO males, where only 3 specimens were available at the time. Femur bone and lumbar spine were dissected post mortem. The femurs underwent bone fracture analysis by 3-point bend test fixture 550lb G238 from TestResources (Shakopee, USA) with the upper roller and lower supports having a diameter of 2 mm. The tests were run on a Zwick tensile test machine (Zwicki, ZwickRoell, Germany) with a 200\u00a0N load cell and the following test parameters: distance of lower supports\u2009=\u200910\u00a0mm; pre-load\u2009=\u20090.1 N; speed until pre-load\u2009=\u200950\u00a0mm/min; test speed\u2009=\u200910\u00a0mm/min. The value measured was Force at break (F). The bones were stored at room temperature before testing. The samples were placed in a similar manner on the supports with the distal end to the right and the proximal side to the left. The posterior surface was facing down. The femurs were detached from the remains of the tibia prior to testing and any remaining soft tissue was removed immediately before testing. Values for Force at break were excluded, when the specimen slipped from the machine.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45071, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Femur morphometry", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45089, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Femurs were measured in 3D from whole body scans in DataViewer 1.5.4.0 (Bruker, Belgium).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45179, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For data acquisition, anesthetized (20% zoletil\u2009+\u2009xylazim\u2014Virbac, France) mice were scanned in Bruker SkyScan 1176 High Resolution In-Vivo X-Ray Microtomograph (Bruker, Belgium) at the resolution of 35\u00a0\u00b5m (0.5\u00a0mm Al filter, voltage 50\u00a0kV, current 160\u00a0\u00b5A, exposure 200\u00a0ms, rotation 0.7\u00b0 in 180\u00b0 scan).
