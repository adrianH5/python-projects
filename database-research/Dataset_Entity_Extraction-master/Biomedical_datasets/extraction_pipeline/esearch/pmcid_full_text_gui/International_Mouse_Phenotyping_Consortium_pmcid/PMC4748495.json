A body weight phenotype is a common result of knockout studies. As body weight correlates with many other biological traits, this challenges the interpretation of related gene-phenotype associations. Co-correlation can lead to gene-phenotype associations that are potentially misleading. Here we use statistical modelling to account for body weight as a potential confounder to assess the impact. We find that there is a considerable impact on previously established gene-phenotype associations due to an increase in sensitivity as well as the confounding effect. We investigated the existing ontologies to represent this phenotypic information and we explored ways to ontologically represent the results of the influence of confounders on gene-phenotype associations.

In this paper we use the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) statistical analysis pipeline as a use case study. The goal of the IMPC is to produce and phenotypically characterise 20,000 knockout mouse strains in a reproducible manner across multiple research centres. This high-throughput phenotyping is based on a pipeline concept where a mouse is characterised in a series of phenotype screens underpinned by standard operating procedures defined by the IMPC in the International Mouse Phenotyping Resource of Standardised Screens (IMPReSS) resource. This pipeline approach characterises seven males and seven females for each knockout line and results in data for over 200 physiological variables that cover a variety of disease-related and biological systems. As the scale of the program requires the statistical analysis to be automated, we have developed the statistical package PhenStat to analyse genotype-phenotype associations. In order to provide a consistent representation of results, area experts have reviewed the IMPReSS screens and have associated one or more terms from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP) with each variable. For example, the variable \u201cfasted blood glucose concentration\u201d is associated to three MP terms: \u201cabnormal-\u201d, \u201cincreased-\u201d, and \u201cdecreased-\u201d \u201c-fasted circulating glucose level\u201d. Using this approach, abnormal phenotypes identified via statistical analysis are summarised as gene-phenotype associations, easily understood by the biological community and facilitating dissemination to the community (Fig.\u00a01). The current analysis pipeline only takes sex into consideration when identifying abnormal phenotypes. Sharing these gene-phenotype annotations also enables data mining across species and studies e.g. for disease gene candidate discovery, pharmacogenetics and evolutionary studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4467, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "During the statistical comparison of control and gene-altered data, confounding variables associated with both the genotype change and the phenotype of interest can lead to an association that is true but potentially biologically misleading. The presence of the confounding relationship can lead to errors in the estimates of the relationship between the treatment of interest (here the genotype change) and the variable of interest (here the phenotype). Good experimental design can manage many potential confounders using standardisation e.g. with the potential confounder of age, the study would only test animals of the same age. An alternative strategy is randomisation, in which animals of multiple ages are tested in both control and the experimental knockout group. Yet another strategy is grouping (blocking) according to a confounding variable (e.g. pup or adult). Depending on the strategy applied, the final annotation could be specific to one particular age. To minimise the potential impact of confounders within IMPC, the community identified critical sources of variation in screens and used this to develop a standardised operating procedure which, where possible, minimises variation and captures potential sources of variation as metadata with each dataset. Metadata parameters (e.g. X-ray equipment) are included in the IMPReSS protocols and submitted metadata is used to determine comparison groups as part of the statistical analysis pipeline.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5933, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In many research studies, it is not possible to manage confounding variables during the design. For example, in many gene knockout studies, the knockout animals show an abnormal body weight change. Therefore, any other phenotypic traits (e.g. abnormal body fat mass MP:0012320) that correlate with body weight will also be impacted. As the experimenter cannot control this potential confounder through the design, it is necessary to consider statistical methods for non-equivalent groups. These include regression methods where the confounder is treated as a covariate, meaning the statistical test will assess the effect of the genotype on the phenotype after adjusting for the confounder\u2019s relationship. This requires a dataset to be processed twice, first without and then with the confounder in the statistical analysis; giving two sets of results for the test of genotype. This granularity has a high potential value to improve our interpretation of the relationship between a gene and associated phenotypes. However, the vast majority of MP terms represent absolute phenotype changes in a variable of interest. The Mouse Genome Informatics database (MGI) developed MP to manually curate the scientific literature. However, only in rare, clear cause and effect cases are confounding variables represented as part of the ontology. For example, the term \u201cprogressive muscle weakness\u201d (MP:0000748) is defined as a muscle weakness that increases with time. Time or age are clearly contributing to the severity of the phenotype and thus represent knowledge that should be represented in the ontology. However, in many studies a confounding variable is noted by authors\u2019 to contribute to a phenotype, but a clear cause and effect relationship is not established. The current mechanism employed by MGI is to manage confounders at the level of annotation by utilising free text qualifiers. For example, the curator will note if an author states body weight was a confounder when associating a phenotype to a genotype. With the scale of IMPC data and the automated aspect of statistical analysis and subsequent annotation, we have the potential to manage these issues in a consistent way and through standardisation better support downstream informatic analysis. The interest in including body weight as a covariate, in both high throughput phenotyping studies and small scale studies, is growing.

While this paper generalises to gene-phenotype annotations, MGI distinguishes further the additional data such as the genetic background or the sex if there is a difference between male and female mice.

The alternative of storing this information is to use a Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). In RDBMS, a table scheme is used which faces the computational challenges of multiple joins when querying across many tables and is therefore less scalable. The second advantage is that RDF is a well-established community standard recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is readily extendible. For example, the same MP term can be associated to other confounders (e.g. body length) using the same predicate. This common structure will lead to a robust data model which will improve efficiency when searching for information.

However, analysing the data with and without body weight returns a richer understanding of the phenotypic abnormality. With interest growing in the impact of body weight on phenotypes and the scale of projects being conducted by high throughput phenotyping consortiums, being able to disseminate annotated phenotype data has become an important issue. We have demonstrated that the impact of including weight as a confounder in the analysis has significant impact on the annotations returned.
