A biased set of 110 single-gene knockout mouse strains was screened for 1 or more nociception and hypersensitivity assays, including chemical nociception (formalin) and mechanical and thermal nociception (von Frey filaments and Hargreaves tests, respectively), with or without an inflammatory agent (complete Freund's adjuvant). We identified 13 single-gene knockout strains with altered nocifensive behavior in 1 or more assays. All these novel mouse models are openly available to the scientific community to study gene function. Two of the 13 genes (Gria1 and Htr3a) have been previously reported with nociception-related phenotypes in genetically engineered mouse strains and represent useful benchmarking standards. One of the 13 genes (Cnrip1) is known from human studies to play a role in pain modulation and the knockout mouse reported herein can be used to explore this function further. The remaining 10 genes (Abhd13, Alg6, BC048562, Cgnl1, Cp, Mmp16, Oxa1l, Tecpr2, Trim14, and Trim2) reveal novel pathways involved in nociception and may provide new knowledge to better understand genetic mechanisms of inflammatory pain and to serve as models for therapeutic target validation and drug development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1774, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

An estimated 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, which leads to increased health costs, loss of productivity, and perceived lower quality of life. Pain can present as the primary condition or as a comorbidity of conditions as diverse as cancer, multiple sclerosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Clinical pain perception is complex, involving physical, cognitive, contextual, and emotional components. Despite this complexity, the heritability of pain-related traits in mammals is well accepted.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2497, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Nociception is defined as \u201cthe neural process of encoding noxious stimuli.\u201d Although animal models cannot capture all components of clinical pain, the mouse has been used extensively as a genetic model of nociception. For example, PainGenesdb reports 430 genes with published pain-related phenotypes (queried March 11, 2021). Analysis of the correlation of common nociception parameters in inbred mouse strains reveals at least 5 genetically dissociable categories of nociception and hypersensitivity.

As of data release 15.0, phenotyping data were available for 7824 genes (www.mousephenotype.org). The IMPC phenotyping pipeline is a hypothesis-generating screen designed to identify gross abnormalities in neurobehavior, cardiac function, metabolism, body composition, skeletal structure, vision, hearing, and blood composition. This broad screen is not designed to explore mechanistic underpinnings but is an invaluable first step in the characterization of genetic models of human disease. The IMPC pipeline does not include any screen for nociception. In the current study, 5 IMPC centers assessed the feasibility of including such a screen. Assays were selected from the genetically distinct classifications mentioned above and include (1) subacute/late phase formalin, a tonic nociceptive test that induces an organized (licking) nocifensive response; (2) von Frey and (3) Hargreaves, which are evoked mechanical and thermal stimuli, respectively, that induce a reflexive withdrawal response; and (4) complete Freund's adjuvant, a chronic inflammatory agent that when coupled with von Frey and Hargreaves can assess mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, respectively. Each center piloted the assays available to them on strains from their active IMPC mouse colonies. Gene selection criteria fell into 3 categories: (1) nominations from domain experts, (2) functional evidence highlighted on GeneWeaver, and (3) unbiased selection. This resulted in 110 single-gene knockout mouse strains being screened for 1 or more nociception and hypersensitivity assays.

The 390 Plantar Test head was set at 10% idle intensity and 100% test intensity. This is a high heat administration intensity relative to the other contributing centers which resulted in very short (sub 3 seconds) response times even pre-CFA administration. This is atypical for Hargreaves which is classically configured to yield a response latency of 10 to 12 seconds in naive mice to detect hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity. The detection of thermal stimuli depends on activation of heat-gated ion channels with threshold temperatures ranging from warm (TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPM4, and TRPM5) to very warm (TRPV1) to extremely hot (TRPV2). These channels open once their threshold is exceeded, so the rapid response latency detected by UCD simply represents the speed with which thermal thresholds are exceeded for multiple channel types when using a high-intensity administration. Latency to respond was measured in seconds up to a maximum exposure time of 30 seconds, at which time the heat was stopped. Baseline measurements were collected 30 to 60 minutes before CFA administration, and mice were retested at 24 and 144 hours (6 days) after CFA administration.

Procedural details are reported on the IMPC web site (available at: https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress/ProcedureInfo?action=list'procID=496'pipeID=7). In brief, animals were acclimated to the open-field procedural room for at least 30 minutes before testing, and the test duration was 20 minutes.

Typically, screens of thousands of genes aim to maintain a false discovery rate below 5% and use a significance level of 10\u22124. This is the strategy adopted by the IMPC (www.mousephenotype.org). By contrast, experiments that compare only a few strains may use 10\u22122 or greater as the statistical decision threshold level. This study of 110 genes falls between these extremes, and our choice of significance level was made accordingly.

Knockout strains for Aqp1, BC048562, Lats1, Nrxn2, Rsad2, and Stk36 were classified specifically as hypoactive from open-field testing. Of these, BC048562 presented with a putative carryover effect, and Nrxn2 (trend towards hypersensitivity) and Rsad2 (trend towards hyposensitivity) were both genes of potential interest. Three strains were reported solely with abnormal anxiety-like or exploratory behavior from open-field data as follows: decreased anxiety-like behavior was measured for Akr1b3 and Piezo2 mutant strains and increased vertical activity was reported for Rnpepl1 mutants. Of these, only Piezo2 [sexually dimorphic trend towards hyposensitivity (female) or hypersensitivity (male)] was reported as a nociception gene of potential interest. Abnormalities in both locomotor and anxiety-like or exploratory behaviors were ascribed to Foxn3, Gabra2, Maged1, Mmp16, Sez6l, Slc30a4, and Tecpr2 knockout strains. Of these Mmp16 (predominantly hyperactive) showed reduced nocifensive behaviors (females only), Tecpr2 (predominantly hyperactive) gave a mixed response depending on the nociception assay, whereas Gabra2 (predominantly increased anxiety-like behavior) was a nociception gene of interest due to a carryover effect and Maged1 (predominantly hypoactive) was a gene of interest that gave a mixed response (males only) depending on the nociception assay.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 56314, "infons": {"file": "jop-163-1139-g004.jpg", "id": "F4", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Single-gene knockout strains grouped by nocifensive, locomotor, and anxiety-like or exploratory behavior.

Independently of SFARI, CP has been linked to ASD in children and is featured herein. CP encodes ceruloplasmin, a ferroxidase involved in iron homeostasis. Ceruloplasmin deficiency in humans results in aceruloplasminemia, a rare neurodegenerative disorder with brain iron accumulation. Neurological symptoms are detected in the third to seventh decade of life and include movement disorders, ataxia, dysarthria, and progressive dementia. Reduced CP levels have also been associated with ASD through biochemical measurement of circulating ceruloplasmin and integrated transcriptomic analyses. The reduction or absence of ceruloplasmin activity results in cell death through at least 2 mechanisms. Ceruloplasmin deficiency in cerebellar astrocytes results in an intracellular build-up of ferrous (Fe2+) iron that is believed to cause cell death through the generation of toxic reactive oxygen intermediates. By contrast, Purkinje neurons are believed to be lost in patients with aceruloplasminemia because of iron deficiency. Multiple Cp loss-of-function mutations have been reported to phenocopy aspects of human aceruloplasminemia, including motor coordination deficits observed at age 16 months.
