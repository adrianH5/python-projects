The Experimental Animal Division, one of the BRC infrastructure divisions, has been designated as the core facility for mouse resources within the National BioResource Project (NBRP) by the Japanese government since FY2002. Our activities regarding the collection, preservation, quality control, and distribution of mouse resources have been supported by the research community, including evaluations and guidance on advancing social and research needs, as well as the operations and future direction of the BRC. Expenditure for collection, preservation, and quality-control operations of the BRC, as a national core facility, has been funded by the government, while distribution has been separately funded by users\u2019 reimbursement fees. We have collected over 9000 strains created mainly by Japanese scientists including Nobel laureates and researchers in cutting-edge fields and distributed mice to 7000 scientists with 1500 organizations in Japan and globally. Our users have published 1000 outstanding papers and a few dozen patents. The collected mouse resources are accessible via the RIKEN BRC website, with a revised version of the searchable online catalog. In addition, to enhance the visibility of useful strains, we have launched web corners designated as the \u201cMouse of the Month\u201d and \u201cToday\u2019s Tool and Model.\u201d Only high-demand strains are maintained in live colonies, while other strains are cryopreserved as embryos or sperm to achieve cost-effective management. Since 2007, the RIKEN BRC has built up a back-up facility in the RIKEN Harima branch to protect the deposited strains from disasters. Our mice have been distributed with high quality through the application of strict microbial and genetic quality control programs that cover a globally accepted pathogens list and mutated alleles generated by various methods. Added value features, such as information about users\u2019 publications, standardized phenotyping data, and genome sequences of the collected strains, are important to facilitate the use of our resources. We have added and disseminated such information in collaboration with the NBRP Information Center and the NBRP Genome Information Upgrading Program.
