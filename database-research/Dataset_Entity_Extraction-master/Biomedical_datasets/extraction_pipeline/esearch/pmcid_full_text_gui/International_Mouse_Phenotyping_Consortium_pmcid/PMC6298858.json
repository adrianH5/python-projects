With the help of GWASs, many loci associated with obesity have been identified. However, missing heritability, which is defined as the fact that variants identified so far can explain only a small proportion of the observed heritability of diseases, is still a big challenge. For example, with up to 339,224 individuals, Locke et al. identified 97 body mass index (BMI)-associated loci, which only account for 2.7% of BMI variation. In contrast, the heritability of BMI was estimated as 40\u201370%. One significant limitation of GWASs is that it examines the effect of each locus independently. However, complex diseases often arise from genetic interactions. In addition, ignorance of genetic interactions is believed to be an important cause for a substantial proportion of the missing heritability in studies of complex diseases/traits. Therefore, researchers have tried to detect epistasis. However, interaction analyses using SNPs in the whole genome usually suffer from the problem of a very stringent significance. Therefore, it is important to select regions of interest to discover the association signal. To solve this problem, previous studies usually restricted the search to a few candidate genes, risk SNPs that had weak marginal effects, known GWAS hits, protein\u2013protein interactions, or pathway information.

Of the heritability explained by susceptibility SNPs identified by GWASs, SNPs in regulatory elements were estimated to account for 79% of the variance. Variants in enhancers often regulate target gene expression through long-range interaction. In addition, analyses of 3D genomic architecture showed that enhancers within a gene\u2019s regulatory circuitry can physically interact with one another and collectively regulate the expression of the target gene.

An inhouse python script, which can be freely downloaded from the web resource (https://github.com/studentyaoshi/IACRC/), was used to obtain potential interacting regions within chromatin regulatory circuits meeting one of the following conditions. Firstly, Hi-C chromatin interacting regions for the obesity relevant cells were downloaded from published articles and the 4DGenome chromatin interaction database (https://4dgenome.research.chop.edu/). The significance threshold of interaction bins with unusually high counts was set as P < 0.05. Chromatin states of the obesity relevant cells/tissues (supplementary Table S1) were obtained from the Roadmap database to get the enhancer region information and annotate the interacting regions. We collected Hi-C interactions for which there was a protein coding gene in one locus that was paired to an enhancer in the other. These pairs were further used to collect enhancers that were associated with the same target gene. We also collected interactions with both loci annotated as enhancers. Secondly, The PreSTIGE algorithm was used to predict enhancer-gene interactions from disease relevant cells. We set the threshold that maximizes the number of predictions made while maintaining an estimated positive prediction rate >60%, i.e., the Shannon entropy Q score had to be below 6.1 for the enhancer and below 6.8 for the gene paired to that enhancer. Enhancer pairs with same target genes were also collected. Thirdly, super-enhancers previously defined for disease relevant cells/tissues were also used. All genes within 100 kb of super-enhancers were defined as putative target genes. Interactions may also occur within the super-enhancer region. We used data from the GM12878 cell line to obtain Hi-C and PreSTIGE-based interacting regions.
