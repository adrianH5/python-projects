For example, it is possible to search for all TFs that (i) contain zinc finger domains, (ii) for which a position weight matrix is known and (iii) whose transcriptional regulatory function was shown in a reporter assay in the fly. In this case, only one gene (hunchback) fulfils these criteria. The gene\u2019s genomic coordinates can be exported in GFF3 format and the translations are available in FASTA format. It should be mentioned that through the customisable output generator, it is possible to export the entire FlyTF dataset as one tab-delimited file.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 14509, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 14527, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The comparative sequencing and genome annotation of closely related Drosophila species has provided the community with the gene repertoires of a dozen flies.
