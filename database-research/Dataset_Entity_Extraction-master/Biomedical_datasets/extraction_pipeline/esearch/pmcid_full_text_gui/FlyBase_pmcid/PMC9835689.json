GAGA is involved in the regulation of transcription of many genes at all stages of fly development and life. Recently, we investigated the participation of GAGA in spermatogenesis and discovered that Trl mutants experience massive degradation of germline cells in the testes. Trl underexpression induces autophagic death of spermatocytes, thereby leading to reduced testis size. Here, we aimed to determine the role of the transcription factor GAGA in the regulation of ectopic germline cell death. We investigated how Trl underexpression affects gene expression in the testes. We identified 15,993 genes in three biological replicates of our RNA-seq analysis and compared transcript levels between hypomorphic TrlR85/Trl362 and Oregon testes. A total of 2,437 differentially expressed genes were found, including 1,686 upregulated and 751 downregulated genes. At the transcriptional level, we detected the development of cellular stress in the Trl-mutant testes: downregulation of the genes normally expressed in the testes (indicating slowed or abrogated spermatocyte differentiation) and increased expression of metabolic and proteolysis-related genes, including stress response long noncoding RNAs. Nonetheless, in the Flybase Gene Ontology lists of genes related to cell death, autophagy, or stress, there was no enrichment with GAGA-binding sites. Furthermore, we did not identify any specific GAGA-dependent cell death pathway that could regulate spermatocyte death. Thus, our data suggest that GAGA deficiency in male germline cells leads to an imbalance of metabolic processes, impaired mitochondrial function, and cell death due to cellular stress.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1907, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1920, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cell death occurs in any living organism. Cell death can be accidental, i.e.,\u00a0caused by physical, chemical, toxic, or mechanical damage, or regulated, caused by intracellular problems or exposure to some factors in the extracellular microenvironment. The cell first attempts to cope with such perturbations and to restore cellular homeostasis, but if they are too strong or prolonged and cannot be reversed, then the process of elimination of the potentially dangerous cell is triggered and it dies. Regulated cell death can also be involved in an organism\u2019s development or tissue renewal program; this completely physiological type of death is called programmed cell death. In 2018, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) proposed a classification of 12 major cell death subroutines, based on molecular, morphological, and biochemical characteristics. The best-known, \u201cclassic\u201d types of death are apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagic death. A key feature of apoptotic cell death is the activation of caspases, apoptosome assembly, mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization, DNA condensation and specific fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic-body formation. Necrosis is characterized by membrane damage, a release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm, bloating of organelles, and acidification of the cytoplasm. Necrosis is often accompanied by inflammation. Autophagic cell death is defined by the accumulation of autophagosomes: double-membrane vesicles that implement cell self-digestion by sequestering cellular materials to lysosomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3488, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In Drosophila testes, \u223c20\u201330% of spermatogonial cysts undergo spontaneous cell death: germline cell death.

Germline cell death is regulated by mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2/Omi but is independent of effector caspases.

The Trl gene encodes transcription factor GAGA (also known as GAF), which participates in the regulation of the transcription of a large group of genes with different cellular functions in D.\u00a0melanogaster. Various studies have revealed that GAGA is required for embryogenesis and eye and wing development in Drosophila. We have researched the role of GAGA in the development and function of the Drosophila reproductive system and found that GAGA is required for gonadogenesis. We have demonstrated that Trl underexpression causes multiple disorders of oogenesis and spermatogenesis, resulting in a significant loss of fertility. Additionally, we have reported that mass autophagic death of germline cells occurs in Trl-mutant testes during spermatogenesis. The question has arisen as to what causes the death of spermatocytes. Because the GAGA protein is a transcription factor, can it regulate the activity of cell death genes? Or does death result from dysregulation of transcription of multiple genes and from metabolic disorders? In this study, we tried to elucidate the mechanisms triggering mass death in the testes of hypomorphic Trl mutants.

As many as 69.18% of the DEGs proved to be overexpressed in the Trl-mutant testes whereas only 30.82% were underexpressed. It is known that transcription factor GAGA is a positive regulator of global gene expression; consequently, we expected that its depletion in the testes should raise the expression of most genes. Indeed, in the larval imaginal discs carrying a similar combination of the Trl-null allele with a hypomorphic Trl mutation, 82% of genes turned out to be underexpressed, confirming a positive role of GAGA in global gene regulation. It is possible that the expression skew toward gene activation that we registered in Trl-mutant testes is not due to the GAGA activity as a transcription factor but rather to other aspects of its function. For example, GAGA is involved in chromatin remodeling and can modulate gene expression by changing nucleosome density in a promoter region. This notion is supported by our finding that the set of upregulated DEGs, according to FlyEnrichr, is enriched with the target genes of transcription factors Pc and Su(Hw) (Fig. S6). In Trl- mutant testes, more than half of the target genes of Trl, Pc, and Su(Hw) show upregulation (Fig. S6). Pc and Su(Hw) modulate gene expression at the chromatin level. Direct protein\u2013protein interactions of GAGA with Pc as well as with some other components of the Pc complex are reported to enhance the activity of the Pc complex. No direct binding of GAGA with Su(Hw) has been reported but they can interact via Mod(mdg4). For instance, the interaction between GAGA and Mod(mdg4) is a possible mechanism governing gypsy insulator activity. Normally, the Pc complex and the Su(Hw) insulator repress large groups of genes at the beginning of spermatogenesis, thereby preventing premature differentiation of germline cells into spermatozoa.

Among 2,602 testis-enriched genes from Vedelek et al.\u2019s dataset, 148 genes were not detectable in our experiment, whereas the other 1,855 showed underexpression.

FlyEnrichr GO analysis indicated that in the mutant testes, the upregulated genes were mainly metabolic genes (Fig. 2). We believe that this evidence may reflect increased cellular stress: when GAGA is in short supply, an imbalance develops in the expression levels of genes from different processes, for example, in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The unbalanced amounts of products of such genes, on the one hand, drive additional induction of genes coding for the missing components. On the other hand, an excessive amount of proteins may not be recycled in time by the proteolytic system and can create insoluble protein aggregates that trigger the unfolded protein response, which alters the expression of many genes involved in endoplasmic-reticulum quality control. At the same time, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a lack of energy in the cell and again upregulates metabolic genes. By contrast, in the absence of the GAGA protein, transcriptional regulation is disturbed, promoting cellular stress, activation of autophagy (in an attempt to utilize some proteins and remove destroyed organelles), and in the end, cell death. This notion is supported by the observed dramatic overexpression of stress-inducible genes and lncRNA genes: e.g., the Hsp70Ba gene which encodes a chaperone participating in the response to heat shock and hypoxia and stress response-related lncRNA genes CR34262, CR32010 and CR45346.

Their knockdown certainly contributed to the spermatogenesis abnormalities we observed, but it should be noted that these lncRNAs act at later (postmeiotic) stages of spermatogenesis as compared to the death of Trl-mutant spermatocytes. The knockdowns of CR43414 and TS15 via RNA interference impaired the polarization of spermatids and caused a lag or poor alignment of individualization complexes; the CR43753 knockdown resulted in an abnormal early phase of spermatid elongation; and the CR43862 knockdown yielded scattered and curled sperm nuclei in late spermatogenesis.

In Trl-mutant testes, we detected 3.35-fold upregulation of lncRNA hsr \u03c9 (Table S3) and huge overexpression of other stress response lncRNAs, e.g., CR34262, CR32010, and CR45346.

Overexpression of Atg2, Atg4, Atg5, Atg7, Atg8, Atg9, Atg16, Atg17, and Atg18 and inactivation of TOR kinase are necessary for autophagy activation by this signaling cascade.

We chose the region of 500 bp upstream of the TSS because it was shown previously that peaks of GAGA binding are situated within this region in the majority of GAGA target genes. Moreover, stress-activated genes whose induction is dependent on GAGA have a strong tendency to contain GAGA-binding sites immediately upstream of the TSS, between positions \u2212100 and \u221250. Our analysis confirmed the reports that the list of developmental genes is enriched with GAGA-binding sites. We detected no enrichment with GAGA-binding sites in the gene lists corresponding to terms \u201cautophagic cell death\u201d, \u201cautophagy\u201d, \u201clysosome\u201d, \u201cmitochondrion\u201d, and \u201crespiratory chain complex\u201d in the Flybase GO database, but we did detect slight enrichment with GAGA-binding sites in GO gene lists corresponding to \u201cprogrammed cell death\u201d, \u201capoptotic process\u201d, and \u201ccell death\u201d. On detailed examination, it appeared that this increase in the density of GAGA-binding sites is attributable to the developmental genes present in the GO gene lists (Table S3). It should also be noted that approximately one-third of the genes carrying probable GAGA-binding sites from the \u201capoptotic process\u201d gene list either have nonapoptotic functions in development or are implicated in programmed cell death during development or morphogenesis. For example, the main role of scute is the determination of sex and the development of the nervous system; engrailed is essential for posterior compartment identity and for compartment boundary formation and maintenance; and Ecdysone receptor (EcR) launches both molting and metamorphosis (http://flybase.org/). Some of the GAGA targets belong to the group of genes regulating programmed cell death during development. For instance, the Abd B gene is involved in promotion of the apoptotic process associated with morphogenesis; argos is necessary for facet differentiation and programmed cell death during eye morphogenesis; Scylla acts as cell death activator during head development (http://flybase.org/); and hid activation causes the programmed apoptotic cell death during facet formation. Additionally, some genes have been added into the list of cell death-related genes according to a prediction of their function, which is not always accurate. For example, the peanut gene is classified as apoptotic because its mammalian homolog, ARTS, has a truncated isoform that is localized to mitochondria and actually contributes to the modulation of apoptosis. Our studies suggest that in Drosophila, the peanut gene does not have a truncated isoform, the PNUT protein is localized subcortically, and its overexpression or deficiency has no effect on cell death. Thus, we believe that the modest enrichment of official GO lists of cell death-related genes with GAGA-binding sites is a false positive result because it can be explained by the presence of developmental genes and genes with unproven contributions to the regulation of death in the gene lists. Only the \u201cprogrammed cell death\u201d list is truly enriched with GAGA-binding sites, not surprisingly, because it is known that the transcription factor GAGA helps to control many developmental processes in Drosophila.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52225, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, these data indicate that it is unlikely that GAGA regulates cell death of germline cells in Drosophila testes at the transcriptional level.

Given that the Trl gene encodes the transcription factor GAGA, which governs the expression of many genes, we decided in the present study to test whether it regulates cell death at the transcriptional level. We performed RNA-seq analysis of testes carrying a combination of null allele TrlR85 andhypomorphic mutation Trl362. Examination of the results at the transcriptional level confirmed disturbances of mitochondrial structure and function and developing cellular stress in spermatocytes. Characteristic features of the RNA-seq dataset of Trl-mutant testes turned out to be (1) diminished expression of the testis-enriched genes that are essential for sperm morphogenesis at later stages, indicating slowed or abrogated spermatocyte differentiation; (2) greater expression of ubiquitous or multitissue genes, among which metabolic genes dominated, indicating cellular stress; (3) opposite gene expression changes in many biological processes, such as the respiratory chain and programmed cell death.
