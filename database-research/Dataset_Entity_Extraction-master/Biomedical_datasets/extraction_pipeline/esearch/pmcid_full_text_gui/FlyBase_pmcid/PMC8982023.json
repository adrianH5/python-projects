The Alliance has harmonized cross-organism data to provide useful comparative views of gene function, gene expression, and human disease relevance. The basis of the comparative views is shared calls of orthology relationships and the use of common ontologies. The key types of data are alleles and variants, gene function based on gene ontology annotations, phenotypes, association to human disease, gene expression, protein\u2013protein and genetic interactions, and participation in pathways. The information is presented on uniform gene pages that allow facile summarization of information about each gene in each of the 7 organisms covered (budding yeast, roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, fruit fly, house mouse, zebrafish, brown rat, and human).

First, there was a strong need for harmonization, the process of making related information cross-compatible. Researchers want and often need to compute across organisms, and harmonization enables this. For example, for multispecies, multiomic data integration (reviewed by) there is significant effort necessary to bring all annotations into one place and to devise custom metrics for each type of information. Another aspect is the ease of use; a researcher wants to look at orthologous genes, and although the individual MOD websites provide much of which is superficially common, different MODs use a vastly different look and feel, structure, terminology, and user interface (UI).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6147, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, the MODs faced issues of sustainability.

For example, new methods generate new or significantly greater quantities of data. CRISPR gene editing enables more rapid generation of mutants of all types, and thus more phenotype and other information.

A potentially more complex website serving the functions of many organisms will likely take a fraction of the maintenance effort, and we can adopt Agile and scrum methodologies to software development, bringing new functionality to researchers more swiftly.

In addition, the results highlight the information used in the result. Second, the search tool must return results that are indirectly related to query terms by using well-established relationships between database objects.

Similarly, ortholog data are included in the search. Third, the search tool must make the best results easy to find by sorting them to the top of the results page, using a calculated relevance score. For example, human genes are scored higher than model organism genes, and protein-coding genes are scored higher than pseudogenes. Fourth, the search tool has filters that support refinement of the results. Each filter represents a distinct data type (e.g. disease) and is populated with terms associated with annotations for that data type (e.g. high level disease terms like \u201cmonogenic disease\u201d or \u201ccancer\u201d) as well as the number of results associated with that term.

Curation requires knowledge of the data and how they are described, the standard vocabularies or ontologies used, and the data model (database schema) that allows the information to be stored, transformed, and accessed. As such, biocuration is the major task of the individual MODs, each of which has built impressive but idiosyncratic workflows and software infrastructure for their curation. There is a continual quest for increased efficiency (and accuracy) and thus development of methods and software. At a granular level, effective autocomplete for terms saves time and decreases mistakes and tedium. At higher levels, improvements to curation have not, in general, propagated across MODs, likely because of the high technical barrier to redeployment in very different workflows. These improvements include use of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and text mining to speed up the curation workflow. Realizing this, the Alliance has started to build a common curation system, using knowledge (and software components) from the broader biocuration community. Another aspect of curation is obtained from authors and the community the MODs serve. Curators often contact authors directly for clarification or missing datasets. Systematic calls for help, such as defining the information present in a given paper, are made by SGD, FlyBase, and WormBase.
