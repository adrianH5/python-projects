Manual curation of gene summaries, while desirable, is difficult for knowledgebases to sustain. We developed an algorithm that uses curated, structured gene data at the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance; www.alliancegenome.org) to automatically generate gene summaries that simulate natural language. The gene data used for this purpose include curated associations (annotations) to ontology terms from the Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology, model organism knowledgebase (MOK)-specific anatomy ontologies and Alliance orthology data. The method uses sentence templates for each data category included in the gene summary in order to build a natural language sentence from the list of terms associated with each gene. To improve readability of the summaries when numerous gene annotations are present, we developed a new algorithm that traverses ontology graphs in order to group terms by their common ancestors. The algorithm optimizes the coverage of the initial set of terms and limits the length of the final summary, using measures of information content of each ontology term as a criterion for inclusion in the summary. The automated gene summaries are generated with each Alliance release, ensuring that they reflect current data at the Alliance. Our method effectively leverages category-specific curation efforts of the Alliance member databases to create modular, structured and standardized gene summaries for seven member species of the Alliance. These automatically generated gene summaries make cross-species gene function comparisons tenable and increase discoverability of potential models of human disease. In addition to being displayed on Alliance gene pages, these summaries are also included on several MOK gene pages.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2019, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2032, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Often, a key task for biological and biomedical knowledgebases is the summarization of the knowledge about a gene. Gene summaries serve as a quick introduction to gene function, providing a high-level picture of the gene and its biological role. A textual gene summary is user-friendly, requiring no knowledge of controlled vocabularies such as ontologies, or of knowledgebase-specific data models. Summarizing the knowledge about a gene is usually done by writing a brief text summary that condenses and arranges all of the current knowledge about that gene into several data categories. These categories often include molecular function (MF) or activity, biological processes (BPs) in which the gene is involved, orthology/homology data and gene expression at the tissue and subcellular levels. Curators may add additional gene information such as pathway data, genetic and physical interactions, drug interactions and regulation of gene expression and activity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2997, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several model organism knowledgebases (MOKs) such as Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and WormBase (WB) have manually written gene summaries, while some, such as FlyBase (FB), solicit them from their communities. The manual writing of gene summaries is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In addition, it is difficult for curators to update existing summaries as new data become available. To address this problem, MOKs such as WB and Rat Genome Database (RGD) moved to an automated method. WB generated gene summaries by applying sentence templates on highly structured data such as gene annotations to the Gene Ontology (GO), the Disease Ontology (DO) and WB anatomy ontologies (AOs) and applied a simple cutoff strategy to handle genes with long lists of annotated terms. In these cases, only a few terms randomly chosen by the algorithm would appear in the final summary, resulting in a loss of information that was not apparent to the reader. Similar to WB, RGD used a template-based method to automatically generate gene summaries that prioritized terms based on evidence codes defined by the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO), with a maximum of three terms per data category. When more than three terms were present, three would be chosen randomly. Gene summaries were generated on demand when a gene report page was loaded and weekly when the gene FTP files were produced. Mouse Genome Database (MGD) had produced detailed auto-generated gene summaries for a number of years, based on the complete set of their GO annotations, without limiting the number of terms displayed in the summaries.

Compared with these methods, automated gene summary generation from curated data has the advantage of being based on key gene information selected by either human curators or specialized software. In addition, by using standard ontologies, gene-related annotations can be generalized by traversing the ontologies and grouping terms by their common ancestors. This allows summaries to reach the right balance between coverage of all the annotations to a gene and granularity of the provided information. On the other hand, in the methods described above, sentences are extracted from pre-existing text in the literature and simply prioritized based on their content.

Similar to previously described gene summary generation methods, the approach described in this paper is based on an algorithm that uses sentence templates that include verb phrases (e.g. \u2018involved in\u2019, \u2018exhibits\u2019) followed by the list of terms annotated to the gene of interest. The key feature of this method is its ability to \u2018trim\u2019 long lists of ontology terms annotated to a gene, by grouping terms via their common ancestors drawn from the source ontology. The trimming algorithm selects the best combination of the initial set of terms, or their ancestors, to be included in the final gene summary. This is done via an optimization process that balances readability of a gene summary with the amount of information it provides. We designed two different trimming algorithms. One chooses the best combination of lowest common ancestors (LCAs) of the set of ontology terms annotated to the gene that provide the highest coverage of the initial terms.

Even \u2018slims\u2019, provided by ontology developers such as GO (http://geneontology.org/docs/go-subset-guide/), contain terms that are high level and not informative enough for the summaries. For these reasons, we decided to select only the ancestor terms at a predetermined minimum distance from the root term. This minimum distance was determined based on a manual inspection of each of the ontologies. We understand that using a fixed minimum distance from the root does not take into account the granularities that different ontology branches can have. For this reason, one of the trimming algorithms that we developed (introduced below and used in production at the Alliance) uses measures of IC of the terms to select grouping terms at the optimal distance from the root.
