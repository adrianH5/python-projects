The levels of hnRNPA2B1-bound miRNAs, such as miR-17, -20a, and -93, were also down-regulated in cav-1\u2013deficient MVs (Fig. 6, C and D). Moreover, the mRNA expression of hnRNPA2B1 was relatively stable in Cav-1\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 6 E). We observed that in cav-1\u2013deficient cells, hnRNPA2B1 preferably trafficked to lysosomes (LAMP1-positive) after hyperoxia (Fig. 6 F). Consistently, lysosomal inhibition (Bafilomycin A1; BAF) reversed down-regulation of hnRNPA2B1 in cav-1\u2013deficient cells (Fig. 6 G). Notably, despite blockade of the lysosomal degradation of hnRNPA2B1 in Cav-1\u2212/\u2212 cells, hyperoxia failed to induce MV-mediated hnRNPA2B1 secretion (Fig. 6 H). This result suggests that cav-1 is required for the trafficking of hnRNPA2B1 into MVs. We also observed that the hnRNPA2B1 had increased ubiquitination, a hallmark of lysosomal/proteasomal degradation, in Cav-1\u2212/\u2212 cells after hyperoxia (Fig. 6 I). Further, there was no effect observed if the cells were pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 6 G).

We tested the phosphorylation, O-GlcNAc glycosylation, and sumoylation status of hnRNPA2B1 and cav-1 in lung epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 7 A, we found that hnRNPA2B1 was markedly O-GlcNAcylated rather than phosphorylated or sumoylated, while cav-1 was predominantly phosphorylated in lung epithelial cells (Fig. 7 A). In response to hyperoxia exposure, O-GlcNAcylation of hnRNPA2B1 and Y14 phosphorylation of cav-1 were augmented in the cav-1/hnRNPA2B1 precipitates (Fig. 7 B). Notably, overexpression of WT cav-1, but not mutant cav-1 (cav-1 Y14F), significantly induced O-GlcNAcylation of hnRNPA2B1 (Fig. 7 C). Moreover, O-GlcNAcylated hnRNPA2B1 preferentially localized in secreted MVs (Fig. 7 D), suggesting that pY14 cav-1 enhances glycosylation of hnRNPA2B1, which promotes incorporation of O-GlcNAcylated hnRNPA2B1 into MVs. More importantly, suppression of hnRNPA2B1 O-GlcNAcylation with a selective inhibitor of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) significantly down-regulated the hnRNPA2B1-bound miRNA repertoire including miR-17/20a/93 (Fig. 7, E and F). Importantly, total miRNA levels were not significantly changed by the OGT inhibitor (Fig. 7 G), confirming that OGT inhibition selectively interrupts the interaction between hnRNPA2B1 and target miRNAs. Next, we predicted the potential sites of O-GlcNAcylation on hnRNPA2B1, as illustrated in Fig. 7 H. To confirm the precise sites of O-GlcNAcylation on hnRNPA2B1, we mutated serine 73 to alanine 73 (S73A) or serine 90 to alanine 90 (S90A) in the RNA-binding region and serine 186 to glycine 186 (S186G) or serine 213 to glycine 213 (S213G) in the glycine-rich region on hnRNPA2B1.

Importantly, showed that two of the major miRNAs that mature under the assistance of hnRNPA2B1 are miR-17 and -93. Consistently, we show that miR-17 and -93 are selectively transported into MVs, facilitated by the cav-1/hnRNPA2B1 complex. Here we further delineate that hnRNPA2B1 is exclusively localized in MVs derived from epithelial cells, and that hnRNPA2B1 in MVs is favorably O-GlcNAcylated. The O-GlcNAcylation of hnRNPA2B1 is essential for the sorting of selected miR-17 and -93 into MVs. As supporting evidence, recent crystal structure studies showed that hnRNPA2B1 specifically recognizes AGG and UAG motifs by the RRM1 and RRM2 domains. These motifs are confirmed in our identified hnRNPA2B1-associated miRNAs (miR-17, -20, and -93; Table S3).
