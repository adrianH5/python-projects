Although treatments including surgical resection, liver transplantation, radiofrequency or microwave ablation, transarterial chemoembolization and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lenvatinib etc.) have been applied, the 5-year overall survival (OS) of HCC patients has not significantly improved. The high mortality of HCC may be attributed to a delayed diagnosis and highly malignant biological behavior, including remote or intrahepatic metastasis, portal vein cancer thrombosis and intrahepatic bile duct obstruction. A large number of investigations have explored the development and progression of HCC. However, to date, the molecular characteristics of HCC remain elusive.

Previous studies have found the aberrant expression and prognostic values of some members of the XPO family in various cancers. For instance, XPO1 was identified as a key gene that plays a critical role in HCC by dynamic transcriptome analysis. Consistent with these results, Zheng et al. reported that XPO1 was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissue. XPOT (also named as XPO3) was up-regulated in HCC tissues, and its overexpression was associated with poor OS. Further evidence suggested that XPOT might affect tumor progression via the cell cycle and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. In contrast, Liang et al. found that the mRNA levels of XPO4 were down-regulated in liver cancerous tissues compared with paracancerous tissues, and this down-regulation predicted a poor prognosis.

Although some XPO family members have been confirmed to be related to HCC, their distinct roles remain to be elucidated. In the current study, the expression, mutations and prognostic values of XPOs in HCC were analyzed.

For example, cancer cells utilize XPO1 to export p53, APC, p21, p27, Foxo, BRCA1, ATM and TopoI to the cytoplasm. Restriction of these key gatekeeper and caretaker proteins to the cytoplasmic compartment prevents them from suppressing tumor growth. The overexpression of XPO1 has been found in various cancers, including liver, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric and lung carcinomas, and might serve as a potential prognostic indicator. In a human ovarian cancer study, it was found that the overexpression of XPO1 in the cytoplasm was prominently related to advanced tumor stage, poor differentiation and a higher mitotic rate, while higher XPO1 expression in the nucleus was associated with cyclooxygenase-2 expression and worse OS. Similarly, Chen et al. reported that XPO1 mRNA overexpression was correlated with decreased survival and platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Thus, the inhibition of XPO1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. KPT-330, a kind of selective inhibitor of nuclear export, could down-regulate XPO1 transcription and reduce the growth capability of HCC cells by increasing the expression of tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53 and p27, in the nucleus and reducing the concentration of oncogenes, such as c-Myc and c-Met. Moreover, KPT-330 could cause the accumulation of p53 in the nucleus and the retention of p21 in the cytoplasm, which led to cell arrest and apoptosis in patients with gastric cancer. Interestingly, KPT-330 can efficiently reverse anthracycline resistance by down-regulating XPO1 expression. Azmi et al. demonstrated that KPT-330 increased miR-145 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells and inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration capacities. Consistently, our analysis showed that XPO1 overexpression in HCC cancer tissues was correlated with poor pathological differentiation, advanced tumor clinical stage and a poor prognosis.
