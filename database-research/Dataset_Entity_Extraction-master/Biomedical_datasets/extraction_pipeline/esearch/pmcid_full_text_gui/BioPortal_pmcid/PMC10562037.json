This mapping process linked each component (column headers, values) of the SQL relational database to its corresponding clinical concept (classes, relationships, and properties) in the ontology. To perform the mapping, the SQL database tables are analyzed and matched with the relevant concepts and properties in the ontology. This can be achieved by identifying the appropriate classes and relationships that best represent the data elements from the SQL relational database. For example, if the SQL relational table provides information about a patient's smoking history, the mapping process would identify the corresponding class or property in the ontology that represents smoking history. A correspondence between the table columns in the relational database and ontology entities was established using the D2RQ mapping script. An example of this mapping script is shown in Figure\u00a02. With the use of D2RQ mapping script individual table columns in relational database schema were mapped to RDF ontology\u2010based codes. This mapping script is executed by the D2RQ platform that connects to SQL database, reads the schema, perform the mapping, and generates the output file in turtle syntax. Each SQL table column name is mapped to its corresponding class using the d2rq:ClassMap command. These classes are also mapped to existing ontology\u2010based concept codes such as NCIT:C48720 for T1 staging. In order to define the relationships between two classes, d2rq:refersToClassMap command is used. The properties of the different classes are defined using the d2rq:PropertyBridge command. Unique Resource Identifiers are used for each entity for enabling the data to be machine readable and for linking with other RDF databases. The mapping process is specific to the structure and content of the ontology being used, in this case, ROO. It relies on the defined classes, properties, and relationships within the ontology to establish the mapping between the SQL tables input data and the ontology terminology. While the mapping process is specific to the published ontology, it can potentially be generalized to other clinics or healthcare settings that utilize similar ontologies. The generalizability depends on the extent of similarity and overlap between the ontology being used and the terminologies and concepts employed in other clinics. If the ontologies share similar structures and cover similar clinical domains, the mapping process can be applied with appropriate adjustments to accommodate the specific terminologies and concepts used in the target clinic.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27846, "infons": {"file": "ACM2-24-e14127-g005.jpg", "id": "acm214127-fig-0002", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Overview of the data mapping between the relational RO\u2010CDW database and the hierarchical graph\u2010based structure based on the defined ontology.

RDF database, also called as Triplestore, is a type of graph database that stores RDF triples. The knowledge on the subject is represented in these triple formats consisting of subject, predicate, and object. RDF knowledge graph can also be defined as labeled multi\u2010diagraphs which consists of a set of nodes which could be URIs or literals containing raw data, and the edges between these nodes represent the predicates. The language used to reach data is called SPARQL\u2014Query Language for RDF. It contains ontologies that are schema models of the database. Although SPARQL adopts various structures of SQL query language, SPARQL uses navigational\u2010based approaches on the RDG graphs to query the data which is quite different than the table join based storage and retrieval methods adopted in relational databases.

For example, if the user is searching for patient records that had a \u201cheart attack\u201d then besides this text word search, they should also search for synonym concepts such as \u201cmyocardial infarction,\u201d \u201cacute coronary syndrome\u201d and so on. Ontologies such as NCI Thesaurus have listed synonym terms for each clinical concept. To provide an effective method to search the graph database, we built an ontology\u2010based keyword search engine that utilizes the synonym\u2010based term matching methods. Another advantage of using ontology\u2010based term searching is realized by using the class parent\u2010children relationships. Ontologies are hierarchical in nature with the terms in the hierarchy often forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, if we are searching for patients in our database with clinical stage T1, the matching patient list will only comprise patients that have T1 stage NCI Thesaurus code (NCIT: C48720) in the graph database. These matching patients will not return any patients with T1a, T1b, T1c sub\u2010categories that are children of the parent T1 staging class. We built this search engine where we can search on any clinical term and its matching patient records based on both parent and children classes are abstracted. The method that is used in this search engine is as follows. When the user wants to use the ontology to query the graph based medical records, the only input necessary is the clinical query terms (q\u2010terms) and an indication of whether the synonyms should also be considered while retrieving the patient records. The user has the option to specify the multiple levels of child class search and parent classes to be included in the search parameters. The software will then connect to the Bioportal database via REST API and perform the search to gather the matching classes for the q\u2010terms and the options specified in the program.

The method employed to identify similar patients based on matching knowledge graph attributes involves the creation of a text corpus by performing breadth\u2010first search random walks on each patient's individual knowledge graph. This process allows us to explore the graph structure and extract the necessary information for analysis. Within each patient's knowledge graph, approximately 18\u221225 categorical features were extracted in the text corpus. It is important to note that the number of features extracted from each patient may vary, as it depends on the available data and the complexity of the patient's profile. These features included the diagnosis, TNM staging, histology, smoking status, performance status, pathology details, radiation treatment modality, technique, and toxicity grades. This text corpus is then used to create word embeddings that can be later used to search for similar patients based on similarity and distance metrics. We utilized four vector embedding models, namely Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, to train and generate vector embeddings. The output of word embedding models are vectors, one for each word in the training dictionary, that effectively capture relationships between words. The architecture of these word embedding models is based on a single hidden layer neural network. The description of these models is provided in Appendix A1. The text corpus used for training is obtained from the Bioportal website, which encompasses NCIT, ICD, and SNOMED codes, as well as class definition text, synonyms, and hyponyms terms, parent, and sibling classes. We scraped 139\u00a0916 classes from the Bioportal website using API calls and used this dataset to train our word embedding models. By incorporating this diverse and comprehensive dataset, we aimed to capture the semantic relationships and contextual information relevant to the medical domain. The training process involved iterating over the training dataset for a total of 100 epochs using CPU hardware. During training, the models learned the underlying patterns and semantic associations within the text corpus, enabling them to generate meaningful vector representations for individual words, phrases, or documents. Once the models were trained, we utilized them to generate vector embeddings for the individual patient text corpus that we had previously obtained. These embeddings served as numerical representations of the patient data, capturing the semantic and contextual information contained within the patient specific text corpus. The Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance and Minkowski distance metrics are employed to measure the distance between the matched patients and all patient feature vectors.

There are 35\u00a0303 clinical and 12\u00a0565 DVH based data elements that are stored in our RO\u2010CDW database for these patients. All these data elements were mapped to the ontology using the D2RQ mapping language, resulting in 504\u00a0180 RDF tuples. In addition to the raw data, these tuples also defined the interrelationships amongst various defined classes in the dataset. An example of the output RDF tuple file is shown in Figure\u00a04 displaying the patient record relationship with diagnosis, TNM staging, etc. All the entities and predicates in the output RDF file have a URI, which is resolvable as a link for the computer program or human to gather more data on the entities or class. For example, the RDF viewer would be able to resolve the address http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_48720 to gather details on the T\u2010stage such as concept definitions, synonym, relationship with other concepts and classes, etc. We were able to achieve a mapping completeness of 94.19% between the records in our clinical database and RDF tuples. During the validation process, we identified several ambiguities or inconsistencies in the data housed in the relational database, such as indication of use of ECOG instrument for performance status evaluation but missing values for ECOG performance status score, record of T stage but nodal and metastatic stage missing and delivered number fractions missing with the prescribed dose information. To maintain data integrity and accuracy, the D2RQ mapping script was designed to drop these values due to missing or incomplete data or ambiguous information. Additionally, the validation process thoroughly examined the interrelationships among the defined classes in the dataset. We verified that the relationships and associations between entities in the RDF tuples accurately reflected the relationships present in the original clinical data. Any discrepancies or inconsistencies found during this analysis were identified and addressed to ensure the fidelity of the mapped data. To evaluate the accuracy of the mapping process, we conducted manual spot checks on a subset of the RDF tuples. This involved randomly selecting samples of RDF tuples and comparing the mapped values to the original data sources. Through these spot checks, we ensured that the mapping process accurately represented and preserved the information from the clinical and dosimetry data during the transformation into RDF tuples.

The fundamental advantage to transform the clinical and dosimetry data into standard ontologies is that it enables the transfer, reuse, and sharing of the patient data and seamless integration with other data sources. Their most important advantage is the conversion of data into a knowledge graph. We have shown the process to transform clinical traditional database schemas into a knowledge graph\u2010based database with the use of ontologies. The main advantages of using an ontology\u2010based graph database as opposed to traditional relational databases is that the traditional relational databases are designed to cater to a particular application and its software requirements, and data stored is not conducive for clinical research. These databases are not suited to gather data from multiple data sources when the structure of data, schema, data types are unknown. On the other hand, ontology\u2010based graph databases are schema free and designed to store large amount of data with defined interrelationships and the definitions based on universally defined concepts that enable any clinical researcher to query the data without understanding the inherent data structure and schema used to store data in the database. The ontology structure makes querying the data more intuitive for researchers and clinicians because it matches the domain knowledge logical structure. Each data node in the graph has a unique URI that is useful to transform the data using the FAIR concepts. The FAIR guidelines ensure that the data and knowledge is findable, by assigning a globally unique and persistent identifier to each data field. To make the data accessible, these data can readily be shared with almost no pre or post processing requirements. Interoperability can be achieved by using standard ontologies to represent the data and once the data are shared and merged with data from other domains, it can be reused for multiple applications for the benefit patient care. These approaches enable the use of federated queries where each hospital maintains its local knowledge graph that represents its specific radiation oncology data but can securely collaborate and gain insights from a collective pool of knowledge without sharing individual patient data. Federated queries involve formulating standardized queries that can be executed across multiple local knowledge graphs simultaneously. These queries leverage the common ontology\u2010based definitions and consistent representation of data structures to retrieve relevant information from each hospital's knowledge graph. By adhering to common ontology terms and relationships, federated queries can effectively integrate data from multiple hospitals, facilitating cross\u2010institutional analysis and knowledge sharing. Traditional methods with AI and machine learning techniques do not address the issues of data sharing, and interpretability amongst multiple systems and institutions. With this approach, hospitals can leverage the collective intelligence within the federated knowledge graph to gain insights, identify patterns, and conduct research without compromising patient privacy and data security. Additionally, ontologies can be used to enhance data analysis by allowing for more precise querying and reasoning over the data. For example, an ontology\u2010based query might retrieve all patients who received a certain type of radiation treatment, while an ontology\u2010based reasoning system might infer that a certain treatment plan parameter or dose constraint is contraindicated for a certain type of cancer.

The overall architecture of infrastructure is shown in Figure\u00a09. This infrastructure can gather clinical data from the electronic medical record systems using HINGE platform, delivery data from the RO\u2010treatment management systems using the FHIR\u2010based interfaces and RO\u2010treatment planning systems using the DICOM data export. All these data are loaded into a common relational database where data mapping based on ontology and standard taxonomy definitions is performed. The mapped data are transformed into the RDF triple format and uploaded in an RDF based graph database. The ontology\u2010based keyword search program that can then be used to query the RDF graph database by clinicians and researchers based on any keyword/s. The software can match the patient records based on the synonyms and hyponyms of the search keywords and provide a list of patient records with an exact match and patients who have similar attributes in their clinical record. We also analyzed patient similarity using four different embedding models where Word2Vec model achieved highest mean cosine similarity indicating higher level of similarity among patient embedding vectors. This suggests that the Word2Vec model captures semantic relationships well, leading to more comparable patient representations. When examining distance metrics, the GloVe model stood out with lower mean Euclidean and Manhattan distances. This indicates that patient embeddings derived from the GloVe model are more compact and closer in proximity, signifying a more clustered distribution of similar patients. The choice of which model is better for an application depends on the specific requirements and priorities. If the ability to capture semantic relationships and identify patients with similar attributes is crucial, the Word2Vec model may be more suitable. Conversely, if compactness and clustering of similar patients are of primary importance, the GloVe model may be preferred. These findings provide valuable insights into the performance and characteristics of the different models, enabling researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions about which model best suits their specific requirements. Our designed search tool is useful for cohort identification and can potentially be used to identify patients and their inherent data for quality measure analysis, comparative effectiveness research, continuous quality improvement and most importantly to support the use, training, and evaluation of machine learning models directly for streaming clinical data. In the future, we plan to test the scalability of the tool by measuring the performance as the size of the ontology and the number of patients in the database increases. This test can help to determine whether the tool can handle large\u2010scale datasets and ontologies. We also plan to perform cross\u2010validation testing which will provide the tool's ability to generalize to other ontologies and datasets and comparing the results obtained with those obtained from a gold standard.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 59629, "infons": {"file": "ACM2-24-e14127-g001.jpg", "id": "acm214127-fig-0009", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Overall architecture of our Radiation Oncology Learning Health System infrastructure.
