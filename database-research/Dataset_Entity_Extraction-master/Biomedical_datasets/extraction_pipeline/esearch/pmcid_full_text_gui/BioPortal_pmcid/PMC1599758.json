The answer is clearly negative, as mutations in promoters or other regulatory regions as well as changes in crucial protein residues may impair the gene's activity without any obvious sequence disruption. This issue is particularly relevant for human OR genes, a majority of which lost their function in recent human history. Using CORP we evaluated the probability of OR genes to encode an active protein by examining their deviation from an OR functionally-crucial sequence consensus. It is important to note that CORP does not consider the functional consequence of each amino acid substitutions in isolation, but rather the overall number and conservation level of the positions with intolerant mutations. Thus, the resulting pseudogene likelihood score (\u03c8L) is a reflection of the evolutionary status of the relevant OR gene, a score that is demonstrated here to be a very good predictor of functional status.

The most widely used of these assays is odorant responses, but other functional roles include plasma membrane targeting, protein-mediate negative feedback mechanism that underlies clonal exclusion of OR expression as well as axonal guidance in olfactory bulb glomerular targeting. Obviously, an OR may become inactivated by mutations at sites related to one or more of the above functions, in other words inactive ORs may still show undisturbed odorant binding. An advantage of the presently proposed sequence-based functional classification is that it is global, namely will show a high value of \u03a8L irrespective of the site or mode of inactivation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 26140, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another major benefit of CORP is its ability to differentiate between functional and non-functional alleles.

These more than double the known count of OR segregating pseudogenes (SPGs) in the human genome, providing additional ground for future genetic studies. Interestingly, 15 of these segregating OR loci included a polymorphism in the conserved Arg130. This residue is part of the highly conserved MAYDRY motif. The relatively high number of polymorphisms in Arg130 has been previously attributed to the suggestion that it is less functionally important than its neighboring conserved residues (e.g. A129 and M126) and hence is less constrained by evolutionary selection. However, in our logistic regression analysis this residue received the highest coefficient weight in the comparison of functional and non-functional OR genes, thus suggesting that other biological mechanisms are responsible to the highly polymorphic nature of this residue.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27220, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27231, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this paper we present CORP, a probabilistic algorithm which distinguishes between functional and non-functional OR genes with high precision (Additional file 1).
