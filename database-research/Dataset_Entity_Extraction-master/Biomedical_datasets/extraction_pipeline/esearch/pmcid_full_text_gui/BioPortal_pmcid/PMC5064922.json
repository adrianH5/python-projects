For ICD, the work developed by was the first attempt to model the ICD-9 ontology, an older version of the current ICD-10. In, the authors proposed the first formal representation of the ICD-10 based on three logical layers of the GALEN Core Reference Model (CRM) terminology system. They used a description logic-like language called GRAIL which allows classes to be inferred with the semantics of role propagation and links a more detailed description of a diagnosis to a more abstract class. The ICD-10 ontology presented in contains only ICD-10 categories and their definitions. The hierarchical relationship of the ICD-10 is not represented and the ICD-10 category definitions are limited to three concepts defined by a multi-axial conceptual system that includes the anatomy, the morphology and the etiology. However, it has to be said that the methodology adopted by the authors to formalise the ICD-10 has some limitations: first, only two ICD-10 chapters are represented; second, not all the ICD terms are represented using GALEN and finally, the ontology was not loaded into an OWL reasoner and therefore, the formal consistency was neither checked nor classified. Given these problems, the authors presented a DOLCE-based formal representation. DOLCE is a descriptive upper-level ontology designed for ontology cleaning and interoperability. In this formal representation of the ICD-10, anatomical entities were taken from the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), morphological abnormalities and procedures were taken from SNOMED CT, the organisms used were from the biological taxonomy and the chemical objects were taken from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature (IUPAC). Despite these improvements over the previous version of the GALEN-based ICD-10 representation, some problems have yet to be solved. For example, not elsewhere classified diseases are modeled as logical exclusions of elsewhere classified ICD categories from the appropriate parent concepts. This solution does not provide any information for a system which aims to automatically classify a patient\u2019s disease d. The doctor should assert or the system should infer that d is an instance of the negation of a class. Due to the OWA (Open World Assumption) semantics of OWL, if d is not an instance of class C, the reasoner cannot infer that d is an instance of \u00acC.

The general structure of the ICD-10 ontology includes Chapters I to XXI; classes are represented by an URL which consists of a name space and the ICD-10 code name, and their relations are established with owl:subClassOf axioms. The ICD-10 exclusions are handled with the owl:disjointWith axiom. This approach does not provide information as to in which class the diseases should be classified. If the same disease is classified in both classes, the reasoner infers that the ontology is inconsistent, but is unable to distinguish the correct class. Furthermore, to solve the problem of exclusions that are shared with multiple exclusions, the authors proposed the inclusion of icd10:hasExcludes that links to a icd10:ICDdescription (with a rdf:type and rdf:label predicates) which has an icd10:concernsClass property. As icd10:concernClass can involve other ICD-10 categories, the ontology requires an OWL-full expressivity. The inclusions are modelled in the same way as the exclusions.

This step is very important in ontology development and testing because an ontology can be used by OWL reasoners without human supervision. If an ontology is inconsistent, the reasoning may lead to erroneous conclusions; 3) no application of these OWL representations to real clinical use cases to show how they can support a clinician in decision making and 4) the reviewed work uses ICD-9 and/or ICD-10.

These categories are sub-divided by means of four-character categories (a capital letter and three arabic numerals) and these are further divided into five-character categories. The file with the ICD-10-CM categories was parsed to output a tree with parent and child nodes (Additional file 1). The upper-level and lower-level nodes of the tree generated from the XML file correspond to the ICD-10-CM upper and lower levels, which involve blocks of three-, four- and five-character categories.

An English label with the name of each category was included for each class of the ICD-10-CM disease classification hierarchy, using the rdf:label statement. Once the Dione hierarchy had been constructed, the next step consisted in including the owl:equivalentClass axioms for each Dione class to model the ICD-10-CM inclusion terms.

An example of the second case is the ICD-10-CM category A93.8 (\u201cOther specified arthropod-borne viral fevers\u201d) which is mapped to three SNOMED CT concepts. This concept points to the SNOMED CT concept \u201c[X] Other specified arthropod-borne viral fevers\u201d, \u201cPiry virus disease\u201d and \u201c[X] Other specified viral hemorrhagic fevers\u201d. The relationships from these SNOMED CT concepts for both types of mappings were extracted and included in Dione to define the ICD-10-CM categories. Therefore, with the new mappings from BioPortal included in Dione as OWL statement for defining ICD-10-CM categories, the percentage of Dione classes with axioms is 93,3 % (with an average of 4,8 axioms per class of the disease hierarchy, affects being the most used Dione object property as shown in Table 2).

As we have mentioned in the Methods section, this version of Dione is still incomplete, and we could still obtain incorrect inferences from the reasoner, for example, when we don\u2019t have a definition for a specific class. In addition, in some cases we could not find an OWL statement to distinguish between subclasses. Therefore, some classes are inferred to be equivalent to their descendants. Figure 7 presents an extract of Dione which shows how Dione looks when classes have complete definitions.

We consider that such an approach is limited given that only using owl:disjointWith could result in a lack of information, because if the same diseases is classified in two disjoint classes, the reasoner infers that the ontology is inconsistent, being unable to distinguish the correct class. Furthermore, the exclusions that are shared with multiple exclusions are modelled with OWL-Full, making it impossible to validate and classify the ontology with a reasoner. The inclusion terms are modelled in the same way as the exclusions. In our case, the semantic Disease hierarchy of Dione is constructed with owl:subClassOf axioms (using the ICD-10-CM concepts which have not been used in other approaches in the literature) and the inclusion terms are modelled from the information extracted from SNOMED CT/ICD-10-CM mappings. The approach adopted solves the problem of integrating features from OWL-Full.

The main hypothesis guiding us is: (H1) It is possible to code, as OWL axioms, the ICD-10-CM inclusion terms obtained from SNOMED CT/ICD-10-CM mappings and use these OWL axioms to build an OWL representation of the ICD-10-CM diseases. Therefore, we have used an automatic process to build a hierarchy tree with ICD-10-CM disease categories and their axioms using the owl:equivalentClass axiom. The main objective of our approach has been to build a model that can be used by a reasoner. Therefore, we have also shown that Dione is consistent and a TBox classification has been carried out by the ELK reasoner. It is worth noting that the automatisation of the ICD-10-CM disease categories is important given that new mappings are continuously being added to complete Dione, whose initial version is released with this paper. In its current version, we have not been able to find validated SNOMED CT/ICD-10-CM mappings for each ICD-10-CM category and so did not have correct results in several cases. Therefore, our first objective is to complete the definition of all classes. We plan to add more mappings from other ontologies which will relate Dione with more biological information from different areas that involve personalised medicine. BioPortal provides ontologies mapped to ICD-10-CM categories such as the National Drug Data File (with 2,857 ICD-10-CM mappings), OMIM (with 3,921 ICD-10-CM mappings), the Human Phenotype Ontology (with 1,370 ICD-10-CM mappings) and the Regulation of Transcription Ontology (with 61 ICD-10-CM mappings). Using the approach presented in this paper, the mappings can be extracted from BioPortal and stored in a database. The axioms to be included in Dione using owl:equivalentClass can be defined with an \u201caffect\u201d object property or also with the axioms that are defined in the ICD-10-CM mapped class of the target ontology.

This enables a set of SNOMED CT concepts and their relationships, taken from EHRs, as input to automatically classify patients\u2019 diseases into an ICD-10-CM category. This has been tested by including object property assertions in Dione from the Virgen de la Victoria Hospital\u2019s (M\u00e1laga, Spain) clinical records which have been classified into ICD-10-CM categories showing the applicability of the OWL representation. After completing Dione, we plan to measure the accuracy of the classification and to study new ways to improve it. As the development of Dione is ongoing, further work will include looking at how Dione reasoning can assist experts in providing classified information for ICD-10-CM disease categories from actual use cases of patient records. Dione should be supported in the future by a semi-automatic EHR annotation tool, probably based on text mining and natural language processing techniques. Our intention is to use an end-user interface where the information processed can be displayed in such a way as to make it easily understandable to specialists in the field.
