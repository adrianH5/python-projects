This matters in the context of the size of a specific instance of the entity, as PAs have fewer constraints on maximum area and mass than do PCCs and thus possess fewer spatial restrictions. Another key distinction lies in the degree of regularity or order in the arrangement of the components. PCCs form \u2018molecular machinery\u2019 networks, which must be precisely structured and contain all instances of their components in order to perform their function correctly. Conversely, PAs vary structurally from instance to instance, and are less restricted in terms of size and shape than PCCs, as seen in the antibody\u2014antigen example. Our understanding of PCCs and PAs is consistent with Schulz and Jansen\u2019s work on grains, components, and mixtures. In this view, PCCs meet the definition of strict compounds\u2014for example, all components of a PCC need not be of the same type but their number is critical. PAs can be understood as a type of flexible compound in that they possess as continuant parts instances of collectives of individual proteins.
