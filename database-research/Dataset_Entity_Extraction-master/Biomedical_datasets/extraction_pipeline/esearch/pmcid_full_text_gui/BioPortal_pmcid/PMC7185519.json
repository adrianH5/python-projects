Issues related to data confidentiality have also limited the development of surveillance systems. Some countries are simply not interested in reporting animal disease cases to the international community because they do not perceive any benefit.

In addition, during the past decade many research articles, reviews and conferences in veterinary medicine have placed a special emphasis on GIS or RS. Several types of spatial analyses are now integrated into GIS interfaces and software and are routinely used. These have become a useful complement for disease surveillance systems. Such tools include, for example, cluster and clustering detection techniques, generation of buffers, overlay analysis, network analysis, smoothing and prediction techniques, area and distance calculations, and three dimensional surface modeling. RS data are increasingly used for surveillance and monitoring, particularly for human vector borne diseases. Because disease vectors have specific requirements regarding climate, vegetation, soil and other edaphic factors, and are sensitive to changes in these factors that can be only captured and recorded by the current satellite technology, RS can be used to predict their distributions.

One of the most important advantages of SNA is its inherent ability to incorporate relationships that are bi-directional, such as contacts between individuals, trade or animal movements. Mathematical methods and applications of SNA has been discussed and illustrated extensively elsewhere. Application of SNA has emerged only recently in the field of veterinary preventive medicine. Most of the initial studies focused on the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK, and were mostly related to the movements of FMD-susceptible species. SNA had shown to be a useful technique to identify individuals, populations and regions that are important in terms of the risk for animal disease introduction, spread, dissemination and maintenance. Furthermore, SNA can identify the common attributes, forces, factors and characteristics of these important nodes so that they can be selectively targeted as a part of a prevention or control scheme. SNA can also be used as a support tool for epidemiological modeling, risk analysis, space-time analysis or hazard analysis and critical control points. In addition, SNA can facilitate the identification of individuals (network nodes) in populations that are critical for the maintenance of the network structure. This in turn can help formulate prevention, control, surveillance, and eradication programs. SNA can be used to identify locations where disease is more likely to be maintained and spread in the event of its introduction into a region. This makes the technique suitable for integration into a surveillance system, in which selected locations could be targeted for surveillance, thus enhancing the sensitivity and reducing the time-to-detection of the surveillance system.

In recent years, the use of Bayesian disease mapping has been progressively expanding spatial statistical methodology for studies on spatial and spatiotemporal variations, trends and clustering of disease and health outcome risks in populations, as well as associated ecological risk factors. Common methods in Bayesian disease mapping include the classical Bayesian hierarchical models for spatial disease mapping, spatiotemporal disease mapping and more recently bivariate and multivariate disease mapping. The concept of global and local smoothing \u2013pooling data and borrowing-strength for small area mapping of rare events \u2013 is at the core of the Bayesian disease mapping approach. This makes the technique an ideal analytical tool to be integrated into a future global surveillance system. In veterinary medicine for example, used Bayesian Gaussian spatial exponential models and Bayesian kriging on canine parasitic disease data in Italy to demonstrate the accuracy of such approaches in identifying areas at risk of zoonotic parasitic diseases. used a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal regression approach to quantify the association between FMD outbreaks and selected epidemiological factors in Turkey from 1996 to 2003; this type of models could be scaled to manage international and global data. The model identified provinces with high and low risk for FMD occurrence in space and time. demonstrated that the model can be useful when integrated into strategic targeting within a surveillance system, whereby surveillance sampling could be intensified in areas and at times when FMD was predicted to increase, which aids in adjusting control and prevention resources accordingly. Recently constructed a timely influenza syndromic surveillance system using a Bayesian hierarchical model which incorporates the impact of spatial and temporal dependence, accounts for meteorological data, and performs probabilistic prediction on influenza. Their study concluded that Bayesian hierarchical models can be applied in a dynamic surveillance system to provide early warning for disease emergence, an advantage to previous classical syndromic surveillance approaches. Integration of such spatial and space-time Bayesian cluster detection models in a global surveillance system can provide a broad, unbiased and flexible range of diagnostic outputs that could be simplified and made widely available. However, application of Bayesian methods to quantification of risk at the global scale has been limited. For example, used Bayesian model averaging procedures and governance and economic health data to estimate the national probability of FMD outbreaks at a global scale from 1997 to 2005. That model identified significant risk factors that can be targeted to selectively allocate resources for disease control at regional and global scales.

For example, when the epidemics ended in the affected regions of Sweden and Denmark it was feared that the infection was moving north \u2013 following the natural migratory patterns of birds \u2013 and that northern regions of Denmark and Sweden and neighboring countries such as Norway and Finland may become infected. Consequently, there was a mobilization of manpower and technical resources by the national veterinary services and other government authorities to prevent further spread of infection. Control measures were quite costly for the Danish and Swedish economies and included, for example, the imposition to keep poultry indoors, temporary zoning around all wild-bird cases, limiting the movement of poultry and poultry products, and screening of poultry and back-yard flocks inside the control zones before restrictions could be lifted. However, no cases were detected in neighboring countries and in retrospect, Denmark was the last European country to become infected in the European spring 2006 epidemic. Because only the south-eastern part of Denmark became affected (Fig. 2), it has been hypothesized that the wild-bird infection died out in that specific region, possibly due to increasing air and water temperatures. Arguably, early appreciation of the temporal-spatial regional evolution of the epidemic in Denmark and Sweden, which could have been through the real time analysis of data using the tools shown here, might have reduced the costs associated with a continued high alert level in the region as well as the fear that the infection might return with the fall migration of wild birds. Similarly, systems with the attributes and features such as those available in the Disease BioPortal would provide support for decision-makers in the face of an infectious disease epidemic. Because there is an urgent need for the implementation of a near-real-time animal disease surveillance system at a global scale, and considering that analytical techniques are rapidly evolving, it is expected that over the next few years there will be substantial progress in the establishment of a global surveillance effort. However, many issues that have prevented the development of such a system still need to be solved including, for example, the role that international and national organizations will play in maintenance and operation of the system, quality of the data, temporal sensitivity of the system, and financial and logistic support. Because of the recent development of new technology, once those issues are solved, it is expected that such development will represent a substantial step forward in the prevention and control of
