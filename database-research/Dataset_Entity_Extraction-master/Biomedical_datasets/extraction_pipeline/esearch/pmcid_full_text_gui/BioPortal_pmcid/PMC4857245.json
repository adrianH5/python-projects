Unfortunately, annotation and integration of ncRNA data has lagged behind their identification. Given the large quantity of information being obtained in this area, there emerges an urgent need to integrate what is being discovered by a broad range of relevant communities. To this end, the Non-Coding RNA Ontology (NCRO) is being developed to provide a systematically structured and precisely defined controlled vocabulary for the domain of ncRNAs, thereby facilitating the discovery, curation, analysis, exchange, and reasoning of data about structures of ncRNAs, their molecular and cellular functions, and their impacts upon phenotypes. The goal of NCRO is to serve as a common resource for annotations of diverse research in a way that will significantly enhance integrative and comparative analysis of the myriad resources currently housed in disparate sources. It is our belief that the NCRO ontology can perform an important role in the comprehensive unification of ncRNA biology and, indeed, fill a critical gap in both the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Library and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal. Our initial focus is on the ontological representation of small regulatory ncRNAs, which we see as the first step in providing a resource for the annotation of data about all forms of ncRNAs.

The chemical identity and first guesses as to the role of RNA were discussed by Casperson and Schultz back in 1939, and the first RNA structure was reported by Alexander Rich in 1956. Since then, many types of ncRNAs have been identified, including the now well-known transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), in addition to the more recently discovered long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and so forth. Many ncRNAs perform important roles in the realization of a wide range of molecular functions as well as in affecting many different biological and pathological processes. As such, interest in ncRNA biology has grown throughout biomedicine, biomedical informatics, and clinical sciences. In addition, the fertile area of ncRNA research has been significantly enhanced in recent years by new sequencing technologies that have generated continuously increasing quantities of available data. However, annotation and integration of data about ncRNAs, the functions regulated by ncRNAs for example, has lagged behind their identification, resulting in an urgent need for effective methodologies to bring together discoveries continuously deriving from different segments of the ncRNA research community.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3043, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Emerging semantic technologies provide computational methodologies that promote more precise communication among scientists, enable more effective information retrieval and integration across diverse resources, and extend the power of computational technologies to perform data exploration, inference, and mining. In particular, the sorts of reasoning (inference) enabled by semantic technologies are not available where we are confined to traditional relational database systems or text-based search and query. By placing more emphasis on the semantics (i.e., the intended meaning) of data, semantic technologies and domain ontologies enable us to establish more meaningful connections among original data, thereby helping to bridge gaps in our knowledge. Moreover, semantic data connections are established in a highly flexible manner that allows these connections to be much more easily extended \u2014 for example when new sorts of entities are discovered \u2014 than is possible using more traditional approaches.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4056, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among all successful efforts in applying semantic technologies in the biomedical domain, the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Library is of special importance in that it has served as an umbrella for different ontologies shared across various biological, biomedical, and clinical domains. However, there has until now existed in the OBO Library no comprehensive ontologies specifically designed for the ncRNA domain, although portions of the domain are catalogued in several orthogonal ontologies. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal, a repository of biological and biomedical ontologies (short for bio-ontologies), is another effort in some ways parallel to the OBO Library but with a broader scope and lower hurdles for admission. However the BioPortal, too, contains, no comprehensive ncRNA ontologies. These observations indicate that there is an important gap that needs to be filled \u2014 hence the Non-Coding RNA Ontology (NCRO) project. As the first comprehensive, domain-specific ontology in the ncRNA field, the NCRO ontology aims to supply a systematically structured, precisely defined controlled vocabulary for the ncRNA domain, consisting of a set of common, standardized terms and relations that will facilitate the discovery, curation, analysis, exchange, and reasoning of data about the structures, functions, and molecular, cellular, organismal, therapeutic, or biotechnological uses of ncRNAs. The NCRO ontology can serve as a resource for annotating and integrating ncRNA data produced by diverse communities, thereby significantly enhancing integrative and comparative analysis of the myriad resources currently housed in disparate sources. We believe that the NCRO will help to address a vital need for the comprehensive unification of ncRNA biology. We aim to integrate genomic and sequence-based annotation with gene expression regulation, secondary and 3D structure information, protein interactions, and their inter-relationships.

When differentially expressed gene-regulatory ncRNAs play roles in altering target gene expression, further phenotypic effects can be realized. Differential expression of such ncRNAs in malignant versus normal tissue can be exploited as a biomarker used for diagnosis, prediction of patient outcome, or monitoring the effectiveness of cancer therapeutics. Therefore, these gene-regulatory ncRNAs are potential therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. In recent years serious attempts have been made to effectively deliver ncRNA into tumors in animal models. Some of the attempts have already shown promising therapeutic efficacy.

The Gene Ontology (GO) is by far the most successful and widely used bio-ontology, consisting of three independent sub-ontologies: biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components.

This ontology contains the features necessary to annotate a genome sequence with structural features such as gene models and also the terms necessary for the annotation of the location and extent of genomic variants. The PRotein Ontology (PRO) has been developed with a particular focus on human proteins and disease-related variants thereof, providing an ontological representation of proteins.

Thus, the establishment of common data elements and data exchange standards for the ncRNA domain is an important need. The OBO Library has successfully served as an umbrella for different communities of ontologists drawn from a variety of biomedical and clinical domains. Until now, however, the OBO Library contained no ontologies designed for the ncRNA domain. Likewise, the NCBO BioPortal lacked such ontologies. We developed the NCRO ontology to fill this important gap. The NCRO aims to provide a systematically structured, precisely defined ncRNA controlled vocabulary, including a set of common, standardized terms and relations, to facilitate the discovery, curation, analysis, exchange, and reasoning of data about ncRNA structures, functions, and uses.

We also discussed reasoning mechanisms to further facilitate ncRNA data management, including data annotation, analysis, comparison, and integration. The examples provided showcase how NCRO annotations and NCRO-based ontology reasoning can be performed to assist cellular biologists, bioinformaticians, and clinical investigators in ncRNA-related knowledge acquisition and discovery. As a common resource for annotations of diverse ncRNA research, the NCRO ontology can perform an important role in the comprehensive unification of ncRNA biology. This unification integrates genomic and sequence-based annotation with gene expression regulation, secondary and 3D structure information, protein interactions, and their inter-relationships, using standardized ontological representations. The current version of the NCRO ontology contains a total of 3,078 terms and 27 relations (besides a total of 5,394 is_a relations). The ontology files and design documentations are publicly available at: OBO Library, NCBO BioPortal, and GitHub. In addition, we also developed a dedicated project website.
