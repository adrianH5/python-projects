Here, we use mass cytometry of isogenic human colon organoids and patient-derived cancer organoids to capture oncogenic signaling, cell phenotypes, and differentiation states in a high-dimensional single-cell map. We define a differentiation axis in all tumor progression states from normal to cancer. Our data show that colorectal cancer driver mutations shape the distribution of cells along the differentiation axis. In this regard, subsequent mutations can have stem cell promoting or restricting effects. Individual nodes of the cancer cell signaling network remain coupled to the differentiation state, regardless of the presence of driver mutations.

Functional loss of TP53 occurs in more than 55% of CRCs, disrupts the DNA damage response, and is closely tied to the adenoma-carcinoma transition.

It was somewhat surprising that cells did not gradually shift toward higher stemness, but were subject to sometimes opposing effects. While the Wnt effector APC moved cells toward high expression of stem-cell markers, mutation of the MAPK signal transducer KRAS promoted differentiation. Antagonistic Wnt and MAPK activity has recently been shown to limit anti-MAPK therapy efficiency in CRC. Our data extend this antagonistic model to activities of the APC and KRAS driver mutations during CRC progression. Additional loss of TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signal transducer SMAD4 reversed this KRAS-specific effect in our data. Loss of SMAD4 could thus contribute to progression of CRC by promoting cancer cell plasticity toward stemness that was restricted by prior MAPK activating mutations. Interestingly, while consecutive mutations also shift mouse CRC organoids toward stem-cell fate in a recently published MC data set (; Fig. S5), the effect of KRAS activation on stemness appears to be different between human and mouse organoid models.
