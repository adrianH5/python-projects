All data were obtained from Molecular Signatures Database, Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Integration, and Genotype Organization Expression. The R software was used to screen out the differentially expressed ARGs (DE-ARGs) between CC and normal tissues. A protein\u2013protein interaction network was established by the DE-ARGs. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted on the first extracted Molecular Complex Detection component, and a prognostic model was constructed. The prognostic model was further validated in the testing set and GSE44001 dataset. Prognosis was analyzed by Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, and accuracy of the prognostic model was assessed by receiver operating characteristic area under the curve analysis. An independent prognostic analysis of risk score and some clinicopathological factors of CC was also performed. The copy-number variant (CNV) and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) of prognostic ARGs were analyzed by the BioPortal database. A clinical practical nomogram was established to predict individual survival probability. Finally, we carried out cell experiment to further verify the prognostic model. An eight-ARG prognostic signature for CC was constructed. High-risk CC patients had significantly shorter overall survival than low-risk patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve validated the good performance of the signature in survival prediction. The Figo_stage and risk score served as independent prognostic factors.

Evidence suggests that the incidence of CC is annually decreasing in developed countries while increasing in developing countries. Approximately 90% of CC-related deaths worldwide are reported each year in developing countries. Studies have proposed that the development of CC is possibly related to persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, microenvironment, lifestyle, and smoking history. Many CC patients do not exhibit so obvious signs and symptoms that a significant challenge is posed for clinicians to determine the course of the disease until it is well advanced. Currently, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate for patients with end-stage CC is only 45%, despite the fact that major advancements have been made in CC treatment methods, including clinical surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Moreover, the prognosis of metastatic CC and recurrent CC is poor. The development of CC is a complex process involving a number of variables, but its molecular mechanisms remain to be unknown. Therefore, identification of the potential biological indicators for clinical prognostic management and investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying their involvement in CC are especially crucial.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3257, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Aging, a common feature of biological organisms, is an important biological process (BP) that involves the progressive loss or degradation of functions at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal levels.

Inflammation, one of the seven indicators of aging, leads to initial gene mutations, increases the risk of cancer, and promotes cancer metastasis. Anti-tumor research has recently focused on identifying the key characteristics of tumor cell senescence. Numerous signatures have been developed to predict the overall survival (OS) of CC patients, such as immune-related genes pairs signature, autophagy-related gene prognostic risk model, lncRNA immune prognostic signature, and prognosis-related genes in carcinoma immune microenvironment.
