This step normally requires curators to manually examine many papers to ascertain which few contain information of interest and thus, is usually time consuming. We developed an automatic method for identifying papers containing these curation data types among a large pool of published scientific papers based on the machine learning method Support Vector Machine (SVM). This classification system is completely automatic and can be readily applied to diverse experimental data types. It has been in use in production for automatic categorization of 10 different experimental datatypes in the biocuration process at WormBase for the past two years and it is in the process of being adopted in the biocuration process at FlyBase and the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). We anticipate that this method can be readily adopted by various databases in the biocuration community and thereby greatly reducing time spent on an otherwise laborious and demanding task. We also developed a simple, readily automated procedure to utilize training papers of similar data types from different bodies of literature such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster to identify papers with any of these data types for a single database.

Briefly, for a given data type, i.e., class, SVM learns a binary classifier from its positive and negative training documents presented as data vectors, by formulating and solving a quadratic optimization problem. The classifier is defined by a hyperplane with a maximum margin that separates the sample space to a positive and a negative half space containing positive and negative sample points respectively (Additional File 1, Figure S1). The process of applying SVM to text classification includes the following steps: selection of features (words) to represent the documents; construction of the training data vector where the elements of the vector are scores derived from the feature usage in the documents, using a certain term (feature) weighting scheme; learning a classifier by supplying the training data vector into an SVM library with the chosen SVM kernel function and parameters; and finally, classifying a new document by converting it to a data vector and feeding it into the classifier.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5702, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Both feature selection and term weighting schemes are active research areas and various methods have been developed.

This situation is often referred to as an unbalanced class distribution. For these data types the precision measure was inadequate as the precision value could be affected by the size of the negative set. The precision value could be very low while in fact the percentage of false positive identification was not high at all. For example, for a data type with a 1% occurrence, if 2 of 100 papers were classified as positive of which one is true positive and the other is false positive, this would result in a recall of 1 and a very low false positive rate of 1%. Due to the unbalanced class distribution, the precision value would only be 0.5. The number of papers that would need to be examined to uncover the true positives is only two after the SVM analysis, while 100 papers would be needed to uncover the true positives without SVM analysis. Therefore the precision value reflects neither the false positive rate nor the effectiveness of SVM in improving the curation efficiency. If the same recall and false positive rate occurred in a balanced class distribution with 50 as positive and 50 as negative, the precision value would be a much higher value (0.98) which is more in line with the false positive rate and the effectiveness of SVM in increasing curation efficiency. We thus focus on the \"filtering term\", FT = 100 * (predicted positive papers)/(total papers) = 100*(TP + FP)/(total papers) i.e., FT = (TP+FP)/(TP+FP+TN+FN). For the above example, FT = 100*(1+1)/100 = 2%, a better indicator of the improvement in the curation efficiency by filtering out negative papers.

First, Chi-square scores appear to be a suitable criterion for feature selection in the classification of diverse data types in biocuration. Second, training papers of similar data type from different databases (such as different MODs) can be pooled to train SVM for successful identification of a similar data type for different databases. This is especially useful for those data types of low occurrence as it could take a long period of time for each individual database to collect sufficient training papers. Third, for data types with unbalanced class distribution, desirable performance can be achieved by using a suitable PN ratio that could be readily implemented for different data types. Most studies concerning data with unbalanced class distribution have concentrated on those cases with extremely unbalanced class distribution, and there has not been much systematic study of how different levels of unbalance in the class distribution may affect SVM performance in different application fields. We have observed that PN ratio affected performance even with some data types of relatively high occurrence and that the composition of the negative training set also has effects on the performance (data not shown). A systematic and thorough examination in the future may provide more insight for better utilization of SVM algorithms for text classification. The method presented here can be readily adopted by different biological databases for automatic identification of papers of diverse data types, thereby greatly reducing time spent on an otherwise laborious and demanding task.
