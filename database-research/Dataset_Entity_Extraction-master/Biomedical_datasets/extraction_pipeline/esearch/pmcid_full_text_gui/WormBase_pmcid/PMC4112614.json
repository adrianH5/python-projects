Owing to its manual nature, this task is considered one of the bottlenecks in literature curation. There have been many previous attempts at automatic identification of GO terms and supporting information from full text. However, few systems have delivered an accuracy that is comparable with humans. One recognized challenge in developing such systems is the lack of marked sentence-level evidence text that provides the basis for making GO annotations. We aim to create a corpus that includes the GO evidence text along with the three core elements of GO annotations: (i) a gene or gene product, (ii) a GO term and (iii) a GO evidence code. To ensure our results are consistent with real-life GO data, we recruited eight professional GO curators and asked them to follow their routine GO annotation protocols. Our annotators marked up more than 5000 text passages in 200 articles for 1356 distinct GO terms. For evidence sentence selection, the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) results are 9.3% (strict) and 42.7% (relaxed) in F1-measures. For GO term selection, the IAAs are 47% (strict) and 62.9% (hierarchical). Our corpus analysis further shows that abstracts contain \u223c10% of relevant evidence sentences and 30% distinct GO terms, while the Results/Experiment section has nearly 60% relevant sentences and >70% GO terms. Further, of those evidence sentences found in abstracts, less than one-third contain enough experimental detail to fulfill the three core criteria of a GO annotation. This result demonstrates the need of using full-text articles for text mining GO annotations. Through its use at the BioCreative IV GO (BC4GO) task, we expect our corpus to become a valuable resource for the BioNLP research community.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1899, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Database URL: http://www.biocreative.org/resources/corpora/bc-iv-go-task-corpus/.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1981, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1994, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The Gene Ontology (GO; http://www.geneontology.org) is a controlled vocabulary for standardizing the description of gene and gene product attributes across species and databases. Currently, there are about 40\u2009000 GO terms that are organized in a hierarchical manner under three GO sub-ontologies: Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Component. Since its inception, GO terms have been used in more than 126 million annotations to more than 9 million gene products as of January 2013. The accumulated GO annotations have been shown to be increasingly important in an array of different areas of biological research ranging from high-throughput omics data analysis to the detailed study of mechanisms of developmental biology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2736, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among the 126 million GO annotations, most are derived from automated techniques such as mapping of GO terms to protein domains and motifs (InterPro2GO) or corresponding concepts in one of the controlled vocabularies maintained by UniProt; only a small portion (<1%) are derived from manual curation of published experimental results in the biomedical literature. While the former approach is efficient in assigning large-scale higher-level GO terms, the latter provides experimentally supported, more granular GO annotations that are critical for the kinds of analyses mentioned above. Generally speaking, the manual GO annotation process first involves the retrieval of relevant publications. Once found, the full-text is manually inspected to identify the gene product of interest, the relevant GO terms and the evidence code to indicate the type of supporting evidence, e.g. mutant phenotype or genetic interaction, for inferring the relationship between a gene product and a GO term. Such a process is time-consuming and labor intensive, and thus, many model organism databases (MODs) are confronted with a daunting backlog of GO annotation. For instance, in recent years, the curation team of the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) has been able to curate only a fraction of newly published articles that contain information about Arabidopsis genes (<30%). It is thus clear that the manual curation process requires computer assistance, and this is evidenced by a growing interest in, and need for, semiautomated or fully automated GO curation pipelines. In particular, a number of studies have attempted to (semi) automatically predict GO terms from text including a previous BioCreative challenge task. However, few studies have proven useful for assisting real-world GO curation. Based on a recent study, enhanced text-mining capabilities to automatically recognize GO terms from full text remains one of the most in-demand tasks among the biocuration community.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 4713, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As concluded in the previous BioCreative task, one of the main difficulties in developing reliable text-mining applications for GO curation was \u2018the lack of a high-quality training set consisting in the annotation of relevant text passages\u2019. Such a sentence-level annotation provides in practice the evidence human curators use to make associated GO annotations. To advance the development of automatic systems for GO curation, we propose to create a corpus that includes the GO evidence text along with three essential elements of GO annotations: (i) a gene or gene product (e.g. Gene ID: 3565051, lin-26), (ii) a GO term (e.g. GO:0006898, receptor-mediated endocytosis) and (iii) a GO evidence code [e.g. Inferred from Mutant Phenotype (IMP)]. There are some challenges associated to creating such a corpus: the evidence texts for GO annotations may be derived from a single sentence, or multiple continuous, or discontinuous, sentences. The evidence for a GO annotation could also be derived from multiple lines of experimentation, leading to multiple text passages in a paper supporting the same annotation. In addition, as many learning-based text-mining algorithms rely on both positive and negative training instances, it is therefore important to capture all of the curation-relevant sentences to ensure the positive and negative sets are as distinct as possible. The usefulness of such evidence sentences has been demonstrated in previous studies such as mining protein\u2013protein interactions from the bibliome.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 6238, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The exhaustive capture of evidence text in full-text articles makes our data set, namely, the BioCreative IV GO (BC4GO) corpus, unique among the many previously annotated corpora [e.g. ] for the BioNLP research community.
