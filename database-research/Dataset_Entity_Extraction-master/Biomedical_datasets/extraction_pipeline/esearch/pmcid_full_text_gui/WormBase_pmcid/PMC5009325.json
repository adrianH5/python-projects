These systems are not meant to replace biocurators, but instead to assist them in one or more literature curation steps. To do so, the user interface is an important aspect that needs to be considered for tool adoption. The BioCreative Interactive task (IAT) is a track designed for exploring user-system interactions, promoting development of useful TM tools, and providing a communication channel between the biocuration and the TM communities. In BioCreative V, the IAT track followed a format similar to previous interactive tracks, where the utility and usability of TM tools, as well as the generation of use cases, have been the focal points. The proposed curation tasks are user-centric and formally evaluated by biocurators. In BioCreative V IAT, seven TM systems and 43 biocurators participated. Two levels of user participation were offered to broaden curator involvement and obtain more feedback on usability aspects. The full level participation involved training on the system, curation of a set of documents with and without TM assistance, tracking of time-on-task, and completion of a user survey. The partial level participation was designed to focus on usability aspects of the interface and not the performance per se. In this case, biocurators navigated the system by performing pre-designed tasks and then were asked whether they were able to achieve the task and the level of difficulty in completing the task. In this manuscript, we describe the development of the interactive task, from planning to execution and discuss major findings for the systems tested.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1807, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Database URL: http://www.biocreative.org", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1848, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1861, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "BioCreative: Critical Assessment of Information Extraction in Biology is an international community-wide effort that evaluates text mining (TM) and information extraction (IE) systems applied to the biomedical domain. A unique characteristic of this effort is its collaborative and interdisciplinary nature, as it brings together experts from various fields, including TM, biocuration, publishing and bioinformatics. Therefore, evaluation is tailored towards specific needs of these communities. BioCreative has been working closely with biocurators to understand the various curation workflows, the TM tools that are being used and their major needs. To address the barriers in using TM in biocuration, BioCreative has been conducting user requirements analysis and user-based evaluations, and fostering standards development for TM tool re-use and integration. The BioCreative Interactive text mining Task (IAT) introduced in BioCreative III has served as a means to observe the approaches, standards and functionalities used by state-of-the-art TM systems with potential applications in the biocuration domain. The IAT task also provides a means for biocurators to be directly involved in the testing of TM systems. IAT consists of demonstration and evaluation of web-based systems addressing literature curation tasks, evaluated by biocurators on performance and usability. One of the main goals is to collect data from biocurators testing the systems, and provide useful feedback to developers on possible enhancements and how to better tailor their system for biocuration. The benefits are multifold, including: direct communication and interaction; exposure to new TM tools that can be potentially adapted and integrated into the biocuration workflow, contribution to the development of systems that meet the needs of the biocuration community and dissemination of findings in proceedings and peer-reviewed journal articles. A User Advisory Group (UAG, http://www.biocreative.org/about/biocreative-v/user-advisory-group), representing a diverse group of users with literature-based curation needs, has been assisting in the design and assessment of the IAT. In particular, in BioCreative V the UAG was engaged in multiple aspects of the task, including preparing the requirements for the systems, reviewing the user survey, recruiting biocurators and testing the systems. Some tasks proposed in IAT build on previous BioCreative outcomes. For example, BioCreative IV included a panel session, sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE), on the TM needs of the metagenomics community which studies the genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. The discussions from this session inspired the participation of a team in the IAT task specifically to address the extraction of environmental and species metadata from free text.

Table 2 summarizes some aspects of the participating systems. The systems cover a variety of curation steps in the literature curation workflow, namely triage (selection of relevant articles), entity detection (identification of relevant bioentities in text with/without linking to entities in corresponding databases) and relation/evidence extraction (capture the relations between bioentities and evidence for such relations). Gene and disease/phenotype annotation theme was prevalent (5 out of 7 systems). However, there was a great variability in the complexity of the systems in terms of the task proposed (Table 2 under column \u2018Description\u2019) and the overall system capabilities. In the former case, the simplest task included the detection of bioentities in text with links to appropriate vocabularies [e.g. EXTRACT and Ontogene ], others also captured relations between the bioentities [e.g. Argo, MetastasisWay, egas ] and the most complex one included, in addition, the representation of the extracted information in structure language (e.g. BELIEF). Also, the system capabilities varied even within a similar type of task, some offered workflow design options, where the user can build customized TM workflows [e.g. Argo ]; management systems for curation, where a user can monitor and compare the different annotations [e.g., egas and BELIEF], plug-ins/bookmarklets for the web browser [e.g. EXTRACT and MetastasisWay ] and network visualization [e.g. GenDisFinder and MetastasisWay]. In terms of the text selected for text mining, three of the seven systems offered full-text processing for the task. However, other systems also have the capability to use full-text (egas) or even any text as long as it is presented in a browser (EXTRACT). Finally, in terms of the browser compatibility, which is important at the time of testing the systems, majority of the systems were reported to be compatible with Chrome (all systems) and Firefox (6 out of 7).

Although all systems have positive median ratings, they are not always accompanied by their recommendation to others. Reasons for this varied, e.g. biocurators did not see an immediate use for the curated data in their curation group or perceive difficulty in integrating TM tools into already established curation pipelines. Based on the interaction with the biocurators that participated in the task and the discussion during the BioCreative V Panel 1 on text mining applications, the latter reason has come up as a real bottleneck. The integration of the TM tools in the curation pipeline in well-established and mature databases might be difficult to achieve. The best opportunities exist in small and/or newly established databases. Therefore, TM developers should consider interaction with biocuration groups at an early stage of database development. Alternatively, effective ways to consume the TM data in ways that do not significantly interfere with the established database pipelines need to be developed, such as web-based TM services.

Annotators in the first group had a higher throughput per hour (approximately 5 documents) than the novice (1\u20132 documents). As mentioned before, we provided 10 documents each for the two curation tasks (TM-assisted and non-TM-assisted curation) to each annotator. Due to time constraints, most of the annotators curated less than ten documents for each of the tasks. Overall 25 documents were curated in 392\u2009min with the BELIEF Dashboard. The manual curation produced in total 24 documents in 374\u2009min out of which eight documents (33.3%) are syntactically invalid containing various syntax errors. The tool does not seem to speed up curation of BEL statements significantly when compare to non-TM assisted, but this could be due to the learning curve for the BEL language and the interface, and the low number of documents that were therefore annotated. However, given the percentage of error in the non-TM assisted task, additional effort and time was needed to correct invalid documents in a post-processing step. In contrast, assisted curation does not need such a step, as BELIEF syntax validator helps the curator to detect and eliminate errors during the curation process. The final survey shows that the learnability, as computed based on the SUS questionnaire, gives the lowest score with the highest variability, which depends on the user experience (Table 5).
