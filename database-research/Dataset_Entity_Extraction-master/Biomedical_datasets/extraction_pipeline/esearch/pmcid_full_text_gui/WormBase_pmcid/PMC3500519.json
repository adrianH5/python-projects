The current implementation of Textpresso for dictyBase recognized myosin correctly, but not the phrase \u2018myosin IE\u2019. Thus, any annotations to myosin IE in the evaluation set could not be made.

We were interested to learn whether a more restrictive search that only returned sentences referring to a figure in the paper was sufficient for curation and might result in greater search precision. Our analyses suggest that although including this fifth category can improve the precision of sentences returned, it can also lower recall. Further, including this fifth category did not appear to have dramatic effects on annotation precision and in fact slightly lowered annotation recall. As a result, we will likely continue to perform the less restrictive four-category searches. Further improvements to precision might instead include a document-filtering step based on SVM or HMM document classification, as well as a filtering step that restricts searches to particular sections of papers. Currently, as WormBase uses an SVM for classifying documents with respect to expression pattern data and as Textpresso has the ability to search specific paper sections, at least two of these options could readily be implemented for the dictyBase and TAIR curation pipelines.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 46419, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Further improvements to the Textpresso for cellular component curation pipeline", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 46499, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to category updates, filtering steps and technical improvements, analysis of the curation workflow provides further insight into how this curation pipeline may be improved.

Such a display would more closely mimic the actual environment in which curators make annotations and eliminate the need for curators to open up a separate Web page to cross-check Textpresso sentences with the full text of the paper. Also, as the Textpresso system currently requires acquisition and storage of full-text documents, \u2018on-the-fly\u2019 processing may be particularly useful for open-access articles and would allow curators to assess the content of a paper without having to download and store the document.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47729, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The initial CCC curation tool was developed to complement an existing GO curation tool at WormBase and was designed to capture a very specific type of annotation, namely GO CC annotations that could be made using the Inferred from Direct Assay evidence code.
