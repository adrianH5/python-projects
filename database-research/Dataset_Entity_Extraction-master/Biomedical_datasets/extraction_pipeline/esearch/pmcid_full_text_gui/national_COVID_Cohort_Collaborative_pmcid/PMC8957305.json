Globally, we observed similarities in the USA and Europe in gender (more women diagnosed than men but more men hospitalized than women) and age (most diagnosed cases between 25\u201360 years of age versus most hospitalized cases between 60\u201380 years of age) distributions. Similar to previous studies, we observed South Korea differed with more women than men hospitalized. We found similarities in comorbidities and presenting symptoms. The large, diverse sample size allows also for the identification of populations of great interest, including children and adolescents, pregnant women, patients with a history of cancer, patients with a history of autoimmune disorders, or patterns of drug utilization in COVID-19 treatment, and which were the focus of additional in-depth investigations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 26737, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Summary of Key Findings", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 26761, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We described characteristics of 4,537,153 individuals with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test, 886,193 hospitalized with COVID-19, and 113,627 hospitalized with COVID-19 requiring intensive services from 9 countries.

First, this study is descriptive in nature. Further analyses are needed to utilize these findings in clinical application. The observed differences between groups (eg diagnosed versus hospitalized) should therefore not be interpreted as causal effects without further statistical scrutiny. Answering causal questions is especially difficult in COVID-19 because of the varying processes by which patients were screened, tested, admitted, and treated; the critical importance of knowing the exact timing of treatments and outcomes in severe cases; and the lack of appropriate comparison groups. Simple multivariable models by themselves will not sufficiently address bias for multiple questions and were purposely not applied here. This study was carried out using data recorded in routine clinical practice and based on electronic health records (EHRs) and/or claims data. The analysed data are therefore expected to be incomplete in some respects and may have erroneous entries, leading to potential misclassification. We have selectively reported database-specific outcomes to minimise the impact of incompleteness. We are aware that this may mean the network assembled is not inherently valuable for every follow-on analysis as each data partner may have different elements missing. Hospital encounters may be unable to ascertain outcomes experienced in an outpatient data. Our EHR partners rely on structured data and may be missing key findings from clinical notes. Additionally, the under-reporting of symptoms observed in these data is a key finding of this study, and should be taken into consideration in previous and future similar reports from \u201creal world\u201d cohorts. Differential reporting in different databases is likely a function of differential coding practice as well as of variability in disease severity, with milder/less symptomatic cases more likely presenting in outpatient and primary care EHR, and more severe ones in hospital databases. Finally, the current result submissions are prejudiced to data in the initial wave of COVID-19 cases. Further analysis using this network requires stratification by calendar month. Lastly, we currently lack data partners in low to middle income countries and recognize these data are lacking representation of some of the hardest hit areas in the world (eg Brazil, India). As data are accumulated over time, future updates of the results will provide the opportunity to study more recent cohorts of COVID-19 patients, who seem to have a better prognosis overall compared to those diagnosed in the first half of the pandemic.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 32991, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 33002, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We constructed a global, multi-centre view to describe trends in COVID-19 progression, management and evolution over time. By characterising baseline variability in demographics across geography, our work provides critical context to the reliability of the insight we generate. In retrospective database studies, one can struggle to identify whether heterogeneity occurs because of patient variability or because of the variability in source systems we use to capture patient data. Here we use a network of retrospective databases standardised to the same data model adhering to a shared ontology and data quality processes. Our study provides a comprehensive view into the first year of the pandemic at a scale unlike most retrospective research. Our work sheds light on the natural history of millions of COVID-19 patients from the USA, 6 European countries and 2 Asian countries. This framework is open source and available for re-use enabling a repeatable, reproducible method to capture the evolving natural history of this novel coronavirus and can be extended to other disease of international interest.
