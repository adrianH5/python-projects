Large amounts of detailed longitudinal patient information have consequently been accumulated and made electronically available for analysis. One common challenge is the prevalence of clinical information embedded in clinical text, which commonly varies by institution in the practices of documenting impressions, findings, assessments, and care plans. Natural language processing (NLP) has demonstrated a great potential to extract information from text. However, NLP algorithms are mostly developed and applied in single-site settings. Therefore, many algorithms suffer from limited external validity and research inclusiveness. In comparison, multi-site studies typically generate more valid research findings due to larger sample sizes, greater representations of participant demographics (eg, age, gender, race, ethnicity, and social-economic status), and more diverse investigator expertise. Moreover, NLP algorithms developed at a single site tend to have poor generalizability when ported to other institutions.

this study, we highlight the importance of using multi-site data for algorithm development and explore the challenges of the development and evaluation of NLP algorithms in single- and multi-site settings. Our experimental results support the need for multi-site development of NLP algorithms: regardless of the approach used, models refined using data from multiple sites showed a moderate-high improvement in generalizability in multi-site settings. Due to the limitation of data acquisition from outside sites, sample sizes for fine-tuning deep learning model and corresponding performance were low, which highlights the advantage of symbolic systems. However, our experience here also clearly highlights 2 additional bottlenecks in the overall workflow that would also be better served being done in a federated manner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13546, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Firstly, due to resource constraints, the annotation process was centralized at Mayo as opposed to in a federated manner. Several pragmatic implementation challenges were discovered and may impact the intermediate and final NLP results. We observed that IAA varies between the 3 sites even though annotators had been trained using de-identified Mayo notes (0.686 F1-score for Mayo, 0.521 for UMN, and 0.373 for UKen). This was caused by several factors: (1) central collection of the text data itself took 4 months as each site needs to complete de-identification before sharing data; (2) as the annotation training began when Mayo data was first collected, it was difficult for annotators to remain consistent throughout the 4-month text collection process; and (3) the shared deidentified datasets were usually small. As a result, external notes were not used in the annotator training. The high variation in IAA illustrates that multi-site participation in NLP development was insufficient.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14540, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Secondly, our experiment shows the need for document annotation and evaluation itself to be a federated, site-local process given the lengthy process involved in procuring the limited multi-site dataset centrally. Site-specific factors such as documentation intention, data capture method, and document structure also impacted the annotation accuracy in this case study. These site-specific factors posed a challenge not only for annotation but also for the NLP algorithm development. In some cases, it was also ambiguous to the annotators that if a certain condition is related to COVID when adverse events and indication of treatment appeared.

Statistical model weights are considered to be possible PII leakage points for several participating institutions. The difficulty in centrally procuring deidentified data inherently conflicts with the need for a reasonably sized labeled dataset from multiple sites to build statistical NLP models. In our study, when comparing our symbolic NLP models with a fine-tuned Bio+ClinicalBERT model for the same task, we observed that the symbolic NLP models significantly outperform the deep learning models for concept extraction tasks. This is mainly due to small labeled dataset size. Similarly, the performance gain from multi-site fine-tuning is not as large as that with symbolic methods due to similar reasons. These results are consistent with many other application-specific information extraction tasks. While there have been promising advances in the federated statistical training space, such methods would still incur substantial overhead in the need for institutional review/approval relative to symbolic methods. Addressing these identified issues (ie, the need for federated annotation and evaluation, inconsistent error analysis) has been prioritized for further development of the OHNLP toolkit.
