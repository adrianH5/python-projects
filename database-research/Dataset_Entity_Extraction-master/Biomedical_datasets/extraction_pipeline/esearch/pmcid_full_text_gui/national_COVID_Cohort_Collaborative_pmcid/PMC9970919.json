Therefore, we used these existing OMOP CDM concept sets to identify the variables (Appendix 3). To phenotype placental abruption, one researcher (T.L.) used regular expressions combined with relevant medical terminologies on Athena vocabulary and built the concept set (Appendix 2).

Disagreements were resolved with a senior obstetrics and gynecology physician (B.C.). In step 2, clinical validity was assessed using the EHR chart review method. For every OMOP CDM concept set, 20 patients were randomly selected by concepts validated from step 1. All charts within \u00b114 days of the date of the concept were extracted and reviewed by 2 researchers (C.L. and N.G.) independently to determine whether a patient was appropriately identified given all documented clinical events of this patient.
