Despite significant advances in high-quality healthcare access, health inequities in the United States persist by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability, as well as by economic and community-level factors such as geographic location, poverty status, and employment. Socioeconomic status is perhaps the central concept that brings together the set of social determinants that shape health and plays a critical role in driving disparate health outcomes.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also shed light on the systemic drivers of health inequities in our society as well as innovative technology solutions to help mitigate the effects of the pandemics, specifically, the need for clinical data sharing and the collection and integration of high-quality SDoH data. The pandemic has also revealed the coupled role of the clinical health system and the non-clinical aspects that influence patient well-being and ability to maintain physical and mental wellness.

One way to address the current state is through maturity models. Maturity models are self-evaluation tools that reflect best practices and can help organizations identify gaps, prioritize investments, and develop institutional roadmaps and strategies for growth. They are \u201cbased on the premise that people, organizations, functional areas, processes, etc., evolve through a process of development and growth towards a more advanced maturity accomplishing several stages.\u201d Examples of clinical informatics maturity models include The HIMSS Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model, the Continuity of Care Maturity Model, and the Quintegra maturity model for electronic healthcare (eHMM). There has also been active development of research informatics maturity models, focusing on domains like research data warehouses and research data sharing.

This could be seen as a manifestation of the initial commitment of many organizations to improve efforts related to SEDoH data. Another interpretation could be that existing maturity in other informatics domains might translate to a basic level of maturity for SEDoH data (no other informatics maturity assessments were performed, but this could be a reasonable assumption given that all respondents were from the CTSA network). Further, an important finding of the round one assessment was that organizations endorsed maturity levels 4, 5, and 6 for the \u201cData collection methods and technologies\u201d dimension of the maturity model, with over half suggesting the middle-level maturity at level 4. This growing momentum likely reflects a confluence of several phenomena: first, an increasing recognition of the importance of SEDoH at a community, regional, and national level, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as recent initiatives leading to the adoption of solutions that connect healthcare and community partner stakeholders together to move the needle on social determinants. In addition, the recent federal reforms of health care and health information technology (IT) facilitate data collection by extending investment in electronic health records to healthcare providers that receive public funds, as well as incorporating social determinants into EHR to promote patient and population health. Novel initiatives have emerged to address socioeconomic and non-medical health determinants within the framework of the healthcare delivery system.

In recent years, public health leaders and researchers in the United States have increasingly recognized that medical care alone cannot adequately improve health overall or reduce health disparities without also addressing where and how people live. Social, economic, and environmental factors influence health behaviors and are primary drivers of health outcomes. For instance, children born to parents who have not completed high school education are more likely to live in an environment that presents obstacles to healthy living, such as exposure to trash, substandard housing, unsafe living conditions, limited access to playgrounds, etc. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted on a national scale many of the existing inequities. According to the CDC, people of color had higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19, resulting from an increased risk of exposure to the virus due to living, working, and transportation conditions, as well as witnessed increased barriers to treatment due to existing disparities in access to health care. Capturing and collecting SEDoH data in clinical settings is essential to reduce health inequities, improve health, and control healthcare costs, according to a 2014 report from the Institute of Medicine. For example, Hennepin County Medical Center standardized food insecurity screening at two outpatient clinics that used an EHR-based food resource referral system. It was observed that systematic screening increased Senior Care referrals by 1,450% (P < .001) and Pediatrics recorded a 275% referral increase (P < .001). Given the broad recognition of the increasing need to address SEDoH in healthcare, the SIMM is a timely and important tool to help identify areas where organizations are not operating optimally and allow them to determine strategies that can improve their operations and processes. Further, the impact of maturity model implementation can be learned from a recent mixed methods case study in Australia that indicated that higher digital health maturity was associated with better outcomes, including maintaining a patient health record, tracking patient experience data, tracking the patient journey, and mitigating the clinical risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 31799, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Challenges in accessing and analyzing SEDoH data", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 31848, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While it is being increasingly accepted that SEDoH data should be routinely incorporated into clinical decision-making to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency, collecting and analyzing this data remain inherently challenging. It is unclear whether or not SDoH are frequently recorded as part of the standard clinical care. Our study findings also demonstrate that standardized data collection policies were endorsed only by individuals or small organizational subunits. Data harmonization across clinical, public health, and administrative datasets continues to be a significant challenge. Moreover, while it is easy to free-text this information within the electronic health record (EHR), extracting unstructured data from narrative notes requires time-consuming manual chart reviews or the use of advanced natural language processing. In addition, the healthcare industry primarily relies on administrative claims data to evaluate SDoH [,]. However, it is important to realize that the documentation of this data within the EHR is inconsistent and spotty due to lack of standards for capturing this data in a structured format. To address these unmet needs, SEDoH extraction research from unstructured clinic notes has been increasing. A variety of SEDoH, such as substance use, work, housing situation, environmental factors, physical activity, sexual factors, transportation, education, and language, have all been annotated in clinical corpora. The i2b2 NLP Smoking Challenge introduced a corpus of 502 notes with tobacco use status labels. As a tool, the SIMM can help organizations understand their current state as it relates to SEDoH data and develop a systematic approach to improvement, but they will still need to look to the literature, best practices, and guidelines for specific solutions, such as protocols to improve race and ethnicity data collection.
