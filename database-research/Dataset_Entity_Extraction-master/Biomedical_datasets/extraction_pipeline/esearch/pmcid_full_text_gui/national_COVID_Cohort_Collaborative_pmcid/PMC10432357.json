They also rely on approximations based on the pregnancy outcome or available pregnancy markers to infer pregnancy start, which may not always be recorded accurately in the data or may be absent from the EHR. Therefore, we adapted Matcho et al and layered on our own data-driven algorithms to robustly and precisely infer pregnancy start or last menstrual period (LMP) in a similar spirit to work done by others (eg, Bertoia et al who used ICD-10-CM Z3A codes in claims data). This more comprehensive and inclusive approach provides a robust foundation for public health research using harmonized data on pregnant persons beyond COVID-19.

Briefly, the N3C, which is overseen by the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), collects and harmonizes information from single- and multi-hospital health systems across the United States and stores data in a central location, the N3C Data Enclave. For this study, we used a limited dataset, which contains deidentified data, 5-digit patient ZIP codes, and exact dates of COVID-19 diagnoses and service use. The N3C Data Enclave\u2019s Palantir Foundry platform, a secure analytics platform, was used for data access and analysis. Each N3C data partner site provides demographic, visit, vital status, medication, laboratory, and diagnosis data; data are harmonized to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) version 5.3.1.

Briefly, we first identified all females of reproductive age (15\u201355 years, inclusive) within N3C and applied pregnancy-specific concepts to identify potential pregnancies (Figure\u00a02.1\u20134). Next, we applied 2 distinct algorithms to infer and validate unique pregnancy episodes (Figure\u00a02.5\u201311). Then, we used gestational timing concepts to rigorously determine pregnancy episode start dates and their precision level (Figure\u00a02.12).

The inputs (A) of our composite algorithm are all individuals and the full set of OMOP concepts in N3C. From these, we identify pregnant persons (B) and identify pregnancy-specific concepts (C). Our HIPPS algorithm (D) is comprised of the Hierarchy-based Inference of Pregnancy (HIP) algorithm (E), Get gestational timing concepts (F), Pregnancy Progression Signature (PPS) Algorithm (G), Merge episodes (H), and Estimated Start Date (ESD) Algorithm (I). The output is a dataset with pregnancy-related data and enriched with COVID covariates. The following are the individual steps within each panel. (1) From the 12 million (M) patients in N3C, we identified 4M that were both female and of reproductive age (15\u201355 years). (2) Of these, we identified 633K possibly pregnant persons who matched at least one concept in an initial set of ultrasound and pregnancy outcome concepts from Matcho et al. (3) To develop an enriched set of concepts specific for pregnancy, we then assessed concept frequency among the initial cohort of possibly pregnant persons and chose 1417 concepts that were present in at least 1000 individuals and were 10X (determined empirically via distribution analysis) more frequent among possibly pregnant persons relative to controls (all other patients in N3C). (4) We utilized Athena and Atlas to expand and curate the concepts from Matcho et al related to pregnancy outcomes and gestational age. (5\u20137) For each of the 628K pregnant persons selected for the HIPPS approach based on the presence of at least one of the 930 concepts in their records, we inferred pregnancy episodes with the Hierarchy-based Inference of Pregnancy (HIP) Algorithm. Gestation-based and outcome-based episodes were first defined before combining them for each pregnant person. Any overlapping episodes were merged as a single episode and any outcomes were reclassified if the gestational age info did not align with the outcome. (8) We then used the start dates of the HIP episodes to discover concepts that occur during a specific time during pregnancy from the 1417 pregnancy-specific concepts derived from Step 3. Concepts with a standard deviation of <1.5 months were kept for clinicians to vet and assign minimum and maximum months of when these concepts most likely occur during pregnancy. (9) The Progressing Pregnancy Signature (PPS) Algorithm was applied to both (A) validate HIP algorithm predictions and (B) provide further evidence of pregnancy in the data using a separate set of concepts and logic: iterations of comparisons of each concept with other gestational timing concepts for each person were performed, followed by checks of whether the actual difference in dates was within the minimum and maximum plausible expected months for the concepts. If at least one comparison between concepts evaluated to \u201cTRUE\u201d, the algorithm continued building the pregnancy episode. If all evaluated to \u201cFALSE\u201d, then a new pregnancy episode was begun if a minimum permissible retry period of 60 days was also met. (10) For each PPS episode, outcomes were added if they occurred within 10 months or until the next episode, whichever was earlier. (11) We then combined HIP and PPS episodes and checked which HIP episodes and outcomes were supported by PPS. (12) Lastly, pregnancy start dates were calculated using the Estimated Start Date (ESD) Algorithm using the gestational timing concepts from Step 8. The result of the HIPPS approach is a dataset that can be enriched to include other variables of interest related to pregnancy and in our case, COVID-19.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12587, "infons": {"file": "ooad067f3.jpg", "id": "ooad067-F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Inference of pregnancy episodes.

Both types of episodes were then merged and quality checked (steps 7\u20139). (B) Definition of Pregnancy Progression Signature (PPS) algorithm: we leveraged further, empirically derived, gestational timing markers based on low standard deviation distance from HIP algorithm start dates across any pregnancy outcome category, followed by clinician curation of expected gestational timing ranges (N\u2009=\u200974 concepts). The patient records were first scanned for this new set of gestational timing concepts (step 1), followed by detailed iterations across the patient data making comparisons between pairs of concepts to determine whether to extend or start a new episode (steps 2\u20133). To provide further clarity, equations representing these iterations and detailed application to an example patient can be found in Figure S1. Where present, outcomes were appended to the end of the progression signatures to derive the full recorded episode (step 4). Finally, we first check for any overlap of HIP and PPS episodes.

Firstly, we used the \u201cOutcome assessment and classification\u201d step to define episodes with outcomes using concepts listed in Table S1. We applied the minimum required duration between consecutive outcomes to determine distinct pregnancy episodes per patient. If a patient has more than one outcome type, the outcomes were assessed in this order: live birth, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, abortion (separately for spontaneous and induced), and delivery record only. For example, if a patient has both live birth and stillbirth outcomes, we first checked that there was at least 182 days or 26 weeks between live birth outcomes and 168 days or 24 weeks between stillbirth outcomes. Of the outcomes that met these requirements, we then checked that any stillbirth outcome followed at least 24 weeks or preceded at least 26 weeks a live birth outcome. Secondly, we used gestational age concepts that were prevalent in N3C data and had week-level resolution (GW) for estimating gestational age such as \u201cGestation period, X weeks\u201d to identify gestation-based episodes without outcomes. We marked any GW record as a potential start of a new episode if the number corresponding to the week is less than or the same as the previous GW record\u2019s week. We performed additional checks to ensure that the projected start date of any starting GW record of a new episode does not overlap with a previous episode. Once the initial gestation-based episodes were delineated, we then calculated the start date of a gestation-based episode by tracking backwards the maximum gestational age in weeks from its corresponding record date. Lastly, gestation-based episodes were combined with outcome-based episodes if they overlapped. If the maximum gestational age of an overlapping gestation-based episode does not align with the expected term duration of the outcome, then the outcome is removed. This step eliminates misclassified outcomes. If an outcome-based episode does not overlap with a gestation-based episode, then the start date is calculated using the maximum possible outcome-specific estimate (ie, 301 days or 43 weeks for live birth).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17302, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Pregnancy progression signature (PPS) algorithm: novel temporal sequence analysis for detecting pregnancy episodes", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17417, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We developed the PPS algorithm to validate plausible episodes identified by the HIP algorithm (Figure\u00a03B, Figure S1, Text S1E). PPS searches for signatures of progressing pregnancy concepts across each patient record using an adaptation of longest increasing consecutive subsequence (LICS) analysis to find the longest subsequence of a given set of concepts in which all concepts of the subsequence appear in increasing order based on when they occur during pregnancy to define a pregnancy episode. To create a set of progressing pregnancy concepts, we assessed the frequently recorded pregnancy-related concepts from our concept frequency analysis and determined the mean and standard deviation of when these concepts occur relative to the start of each HIP episode with a pregnancy outcome. After filtering for concepts with a standard deviation <1.5 months, our clinicians reviewed these concepts and provided expected time ranges of occurrence during pregnancy for each concept. Any concepts where the gestational time range spanned >3 months were removed. This resulted in 74 progressing pregnancy concepts (eg, \u201cGlucose; tolerance test (GTT), 3 specimens (includes glucose)\u201d). Time intervals across these concepts in the pregnant person\u2019s data were compared to their expected gestational time ranges. For each concept, (1) comparisons were made with all previous concepts and the current concept and (2) between each successive pair of concepts surrounding the current concept. If any comparison yielded discordance between the actual time elapsed between concepts and the expected gestational time ranges, this may indicate the start of a new episode. We then checked if the minimum permissible time between the end of a pregnancy episode and the start of a subsequent pregnancy episode of 2 months (retry period) was met. If there was at least a 2-month separation between the current and previous concept, a new pregnancy episode was assigned. These multiple comparisons and checks per concept address the influence of any historical records or recording of concepts outside the expected gestational time range (eg, gestational diabetes screening occurring before 6 months or 24 weeks) from intervening with finding the true progressing sequence of gestational timing concepts. Further cleanup removes any episodes with a length greater than 12 months or patients with more than 5 episodes occurring in a year. To assign a measure of support for outcomes identified in HIP episodes, we inferred pregnancy outcomes in the PPS by checking for any outcome within a window of 14 days before the episode end to up to the earliest date from either (1) the next episode start date, or (2) up to 10 months minus the last record\u2019s expected minimum month after the start of the episode.

We first identified all GW and GR3m concepts within each pregnancy episode, kept only the max GW concept if there was more than one type of GW concept sharing the same date, and inferred the pregnancy start dates for each recorded concept. Next, we filtered out outlier GW concepts that did not fall within the intersection of the inferred pregnancy start dates of the GR3m concepts and did not meet the 1.5*interquartile range (IQR) threshold of the GW concept start dates. These steps help to remove any concept that may occur much earlier or later than the concept\u2019s expected gestational time range. For example, concepts related to gestational diabetes screening (eg, \u201cGlucose; tolerance test (GTT), 3 specimens (includes glucose)\u201d) may take place earlier in some pregnancies than expected (even if the data are clinically accurate). Instead, we rely on the other concepts within the episode to estimate LMP.

We used PPS to validate episodes from HIP. HIPPS offers unique elements not currently covered by existing, published algorithms. First, we followed a prior algorithm that only considered pregnancies with an outcome (eg, live birth), omitting pregnancies without outcomes. As such pregnancies still offer important data, including for COVID-19, our HIP and PPS algorithms were designed to capture pregnancies with and without outcomes, the former by employing \u201cGestation period, X weeks\u201d concepts as attempted by Naleway et al and analogous to the ICD-10-CM Z3A codes used in Bertoia et al. Second, PPS checks if the gestational timing data is progressing, even without outcome anchoring, and finds 1.7-fold longer episodes compared to HIP, highlighting the value of adding this approach to existing episode length inferences. Third, our HIPPS approach is consistent with how clinicians would annotate EHR information, as demonstrated by our clinician validation. Fourth, high concordance between HIP and PPS provides high confidence in our pregnancy episode and outcome inference. Fifth, combining empirical analysis and clinician validation to derive gestational timing concepts for PPS and ESD allows episode inference to be optimized to the EHR dataset available. This is an advantage over using an inflexible set of concepts of previous algorithms for inferring pregnancy episode timing that may not be generalizable to other EHR datasets.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44370, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our final novel sub-algorithm applied to the episodes, ESD, rigorously estimates pregnancy start date or LMP; this is ever more important in ascertaining risks related to exposures in pregnancy and outcomes.

Such precision in gestational age allows researchers to determine associations with an unprecedented level of confidence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44911, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, as proof-of-concept of application of HIPPS to N3C data, we generated 3 types of cohorts of pregnant persons, ranging from all episodes regardless of precision in gestational age (cohort 1) to a cohort with week-level precision for gestational age and defined outcome (cohort 3), and compared sociodemographic, clinical, and COVID-19 variables across the cohorts. Our cohorts were similar (age, race/ethnicity) to national statistics on live births (2019\u20132021) and CDC surveillance data on COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, demonstrating our results are consistent with national demographics. Furthermore, the distribution of gestational ages for live birth are similarly asymmetrical to the national distribution with a mode of 39 weeks. While we generally did not observe many significant differences in the proportion of pregnant persons across the 3 cohorts, some interesting differences arose. For example, those in cohort 3 are less likely to be teenaged, more likely to have live birth outcomes, and more likely to have been screened for COVID-19 than those in our other 2 cohorts. That this cohort type is less likely to have abortion or ectopic pregnancy is only natural given these outcomes have less gestational info. Thus, for example, questions anchoring on vaccination timing during pregnancy on risk of breakthrough or incident COVID-19 infection may require week-level granularity for estimated start date. Evaluating abortions as the outcome would be a likely mismatch. On the other hand, certain research questions may not require exact gestational age, as is common with claims data when researchers assign 40 weeks gestation to classify exposure where gestational info is missing, in which case selecting cohort 1 may be most appropriate. Our presentation of 3 possible cohorts, to elucidate the possible sizes, demographics, precision, and tradeoffs for using exact definition types to define pregnancy cohorts in N3C, should aid future researchers for various research efforts both within and outside of N3C.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46956, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While our work has several unique strengths, limitations also exist. First, we are unable to conduct source validation. Due to the nature of N3C not allowing reidentification, we cannot conduct a \u201cgold standard\u201d validation of our findings against source data using birth certificates or medical charts; thus, our work, in principle, cannot ascertain accuracy. Though we attempted a clinician validation approach that mimicked a medical chart review, it is possible that both the clinician annotators and HIPPS misidentified a pregnancy episode or misclassified a pregnancy outcome. Regardless, previous literature supports our approach for defining pregnancy episodes even without source data validation, and our proportions of abortion, stillbirth, and ectopic pregnancy were roughly similar to the national proportions described in the literature. Second, as with any EHR dataset, the likelihood of missingness and misclassification is high. It is possible that we may have missed potential pregnancy episodes or outcomes with our current concept sets, although we found inferred episode overlap of 90.2% on average between the 25 gestational age-specific concepts independent of those used for algorithm definition. This suggests that concept bias, either in our overall algorithms or in the small numbers included in our clinician validation, is unlikely. Also, because we did not filter out any episodes with a single occurrence of an outcome concept, as Matcho et al had done, it is possible that our dataset overestimates the presence of some outcomes. Relatedly, misclassification may be high, especially for uncommon pregnancy outcomes, which could create sources of bias. Nonetheless, since we do provide the number of outcome concepts and confidence score for each pregnancy episode, users of the data and our approach can individualize criteria for excluding episodes depending on their research question. Third, while our approach has high certainty using the outcome concordance score as a metric of support for identifying common pregnancy outcomes, such as live birth, we observed less certainty in inferences related to less common outcomes (ie, ectopic pregnancies) or underreported outcomes (ie, spontaneous abortions), which are recurrent issues among all EHR-based phenotyping of such outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49276, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To make HIPPS generalizable to other datasets beyond N3C, we provide code (written in PySpark) and instructions in our GitHub repository, https://github.com/jonessarae/n3c_pregnancy_cohort, for interested users to adapt and apply our approach.
