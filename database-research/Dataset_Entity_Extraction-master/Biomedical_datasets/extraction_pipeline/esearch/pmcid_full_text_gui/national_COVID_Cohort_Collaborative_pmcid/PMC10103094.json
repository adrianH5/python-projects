One characteristic distinguishing this pandemic from others is the remarkable heterogeneity of outcomes among infected people. While some patients have mild illness, 18% have moderate or severe outcomes. Worse outcomes have been associated with several risk factors, including age, sex, socioeconomic background, and comorbidities, such as obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Yet, these risk factors do not fully explain the variation in outcomes. Some drugs may change the course of COVID-19. Discovering these either beneficial or harmful effects could improve medical care. For instance, certain cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which are common anti-inflammatory drugs, have been associated with worse outcomes, suggesting that some pain relievers should be avoided in COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, discovering medications associated with improved outcomes can help us identify new therapies. From the early stages of the outbreak, a number of drugs have been proposed for repurposing, including hydroxychloroquine, which was notorious, and remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral, which was successful. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus targets the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through its interaction with the ACE2 receptor, previous investigations have used the cohort study method to investigate infections and outcomes in people taking ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.

Antidepressants have been linked to unexpected effects on diverse inflammatory and cardiovascular outcomes. Use of antidepressants has been associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality, possibly due to their cardiovascular effects. In a small study in France, protective effects on severe COVID-19 outcomes were found. In another study, Clelland et al showed a significant protective association between antidepressant use and COVID-19. Hoertel et al showed a protective effect of fluoxetine or fluvoxamine on COVID-19 mortality. In a separate study, Hoertel et al used a Cox regression model to investigate the association between antidepressant intake and the risk of intubation and COVID-19 mortality.

They matched COVID-19 cases against a control cohort of COVID-19\u2013negative people on a set of 5 to 12 selected confounders. This limited adjustment for confounding is typical of previous studies, which have not controlled for possible confounders, including history of high cholesterol and other recorded medical care. Factors, such as socioeconomic status, can influence disease risk and influence levels of medical care, and such factors could create confounding. It is possible that people with more medical care, including those diagnosed and in treatment for other medical conditions, are at reduced risk for complications. If all confounders are known and well measured, then such an approach could work well. However, given the lack of knowledge about the risk factors for COVID-19, approaches controlling for a minimal set of possible confounders are vulnerable to residual confounding.

To estimate the effects of antidepressants on COVID-19 outcomes, we considered 16 antidepressants from the N3C data enclave, with each used by more than 5000 patients. To estimate the effects of these drugs on outcomes, we applied causal inference methods, including a novel application of health embeddings. Our methods build on approaches like the case-control or cohort study to estimate effects of exposures on an outcome of interest. While measurement of true causal effects requires a randomized trial, such approaches are expensive and unlikely to be performed for every common drug. Instead, causal inference methods aim to emulate a clinical trial using observational health data. While the resulting inferences cannot be conclusively deemed causal, they represent our best possible estimate using nonexperimental data. Therefore, unlike previous work, we used causal inference methods to rigorously adjust for confounding. We used both a well-established method (high-dimensional propensity score weighting) and a relatively less common method based on embeddings of medical codes.

A common method to adjust for confounding is propensity score weighting, which creates a weighted pseudopopulation where treated comparator populations are balanced for possible confounders.

Pan et al presented some references on how classification and regression models provide an improved version of propensity score weighting. Moreover, we included all medical history data of the patients as features, which resulted in high-dimensional input feature vectors (18,584-dimensional).

This means that 2 medical codes for very similar conditions, for example, fracture of the right leg and fracture of the left leg, are encoded no more similarly than 2 medical codes for unrelated conditions. In order to examine the impact of a coding system that retains the meaning of the medical codes, we made use of medical embeddings that exist for the SNOMED-CT concept coding system. While embeddings have been explored previously for matching, the use of embeddings to create propensity score weights has not been reported to our knowledge. We created an embedding representation of patient health history using the average of all medical codes in a person\u2019s history. Then, as with the high-dimensional sparse representation of health history, we calculated propensity weights and obtained the ATE. The ATEs were much more extreme using this method (Figure 6), and the negative control outcomes similarly had a biased result (not shown).

Our findings suggest that common antidepressants may increase the risk of COVID-19 complications. Additionally, in our analysis of the effect of each common antidepressant as compared to that of other antidepressants, we uncovered a pattern where certain antidepressants were associated with a lower risk of hospitalization. We also experimented with multiple methods for encoding health history to uncover causal effects. Because health data involve thousands of medical codes, representing each of these codes using a sparse representation can create a very large regression problem for propensity weighting. In addition, this representation of medical history does not make use of knowledge about the meaning of these medical codes. In order to make use of this information, we alternatively encoded medical history using embedding vectors created using the Node2Vec method. These embeddings have been extensively evaluated as an efficient representation of medical knowledge. We found that both methods had a consistent direction of effect, but the effect estimates were more extreme using embeddings rather than the sparse encoding.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26934, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our findings about the effects of antidepressants, if replicated in other data sets, could suggest that providers should change their uses of antidepressants to improve COVID-19 outcomes among high-risk groups. Among prior studies, Lenze et al performed a randomized controlled trial of 152 patients and showed a significantly reduced risk of worse clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic COVID-19 who were administered fluoxetine than in those who were administered placebo. Oskotsky et al performed an observational study on COVID-19 mortality and implemented a propensity score matching method only on the exposure of some specific SSRIs (fluoxetine or fluvoxamine). Moreover, several clinical and preclinical studies found an association between fluoxetine intake and a lower risk of intubation or mortality. However, these findings do not answer if other SSRI or non-SSRI antidepressants are as effective as fluoxetine or fluvoxamine. In contrast, our study considered 16 antidepressants of 4 types, including SSRI, SNRI, atypical, and tricyclic antidepressants. The results indicated significant associations of citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, mirtazapine, doxepin, and vilazodone with a reduced risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes, apart from fluoxetine. Some other prior studies assessing the association between antidepressant intake and COVID-19 severity have used limited adjustment for confounders or small populations. Our study has made extensive efforts to adjust for confounding. The results support and are consistent with the findings of prior preliminary studies. Further, our study showed that the association between antidepressant intake and a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality, intubation, or a worse outcome is not only for fluoxetine or SSRIs, and other antidepressants from several classes have similar effects on COVID-19 outcomes. Our consistent results from 2 causal inference methods support that these methods can be used to mine possible effects from large health record data. As the methods are not specific to antidepressant advances, these findings suggest that the N3C data set could be used with these methods to investigate other factors impacting COVID-19 outcomes, including other drugs and other medical procedures and treatments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29233, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29245, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In a nonrandomized setting, it is not possible to be certain that the results are free of residual confounding. Although our method carefully considered all medical history data, thus accounting for all measured confounding, unmeasured confounding could still bias the results. To mitigate this risk, we have undertaken an analysis using negative control outcomes. One possible example of unmeasured confounding is if people taking antidepressants generally have poor health. Poor health is not directly recorded in the N3C. However, in this case, we would expect an association between antidepressants and increased prevalence of many other diseases, such as the set of negative control outcomes we selected for analysis. Because we did not find any association of antidepressants with these negative control outcomes, our results do not appear to be due to this type of confounding. Other limitations include the short duration of observation for our data set, as we only used 3 years of data to estimate confounding. Some confounders may be recorded only more distantly in health history, but this time window is commonly used in observational data analysis. We also did not use the duration or dose of antidepressants; therefore, our results represent the impact of any use of antidepressants on disease outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30563, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another caveat concerns the embedding effect estimates. This method estimated treatment effects that were much more extreme than those in the more traditional encoding of health history. Under a conservative interpretation, we believe this is more likely due to the shortcomings of this approach, which makes it susceptible to bias, rather than being due to a true extreme causal effect. The bias in the results could be due to one of the following reasons. First, the embedding vectors do not precisely represent important confounders. As the vectors are only 128-dimensional, some information about specific medical codes that may be crucial confounders may be lost. Second, the method for calculating propensity weights based on medical embeddings must be improved. This may involve developing other ways to represent a patient\u2019s health history given a set of embeddings. Third, these embeddings are not designed to represent a patient\u2019s state before drug prescription, and performance may be improved by applying medical embeddings specifically designed to represent the confounding relationship between health history and drug prescription.

This study used causal inference techniques on large electronic health record data to identify how commonly prescribed antidepressants affect hospitalization for COVID-19 or a worse outcome. The research suggested a pattern in which some antidepressants are connected to a decreased risk of hospitalization. Because the risk profile of antidepressants is well known, our findings can be used to provide justification for investment in future large-scale clinical trials to find the best treatment for depression in those with COVID-19 at high risk of poor outcomes.
