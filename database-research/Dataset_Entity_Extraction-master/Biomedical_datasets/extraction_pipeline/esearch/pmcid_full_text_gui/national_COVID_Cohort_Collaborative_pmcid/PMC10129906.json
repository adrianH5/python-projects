Although controversial, some studies have suggested the 100-fold increase in 17-estradiol levels in pregnancy may also be associated with reduced mortality. Multiple estradiol-mediated mechanisms have been proposed including an enhancement of the antiviral immune response through increased immune tolerance (expansion of regulatory T cells) and antibody production (stimulation of B cells), stabilization of the immune system and reduction in dysregulated innate immunity through interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interleukin 1b inhibition, increased expression of the Mas-receptor with resultant protection against acute lung injury, and a corresponding downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor expression with corresponding diminished SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

Furthermore, testosterone deficiency has been associated with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness and thrombocyte malfunction resulting in an increased risk of COVID-19 triggered thrombovascular events in hypogonadal males.   However, other studies suggest a contradictory pathologic effect of androgens in patients with COVID-19. Testosterone has been proposed to upregulate the transmembrane serine protease 2 via the androgen receptor, potentially facilitating viral entry into cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, with studies also showing increased COVID complications in men with high free testosterone levels, a higher incidence of androgenetic alopecia in patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19,   and a 4-fold higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with prostate cancer not receiving androgen-deprivation therapy versus those on androgen-deprivation therapy. Thus, the effect of androgens on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and post-COVID outcomes is unclear; there is a potential increased risk of infection via transmembrane serine protease 2 upregulation offset by a potential reduction in immune dysregulation and fatal cytokine storm.

In our primary analysis, we defined HRT use in females as including estrogen and/or progesterone, but the results were nearly identical in a sensitivity analysis excluding women on progesterone monotherapy, suggesting estrogen was likely driving this effect. In addition, we show quite decisively that testosterone supplementation also associates with significant benefit in immunocompetent males with COVID-19.

As with any retrospective analysis, this study was also at risk for miscoding and misclassification bias. We did not have information regarding the true SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, and instead adjusted for time periods where a given variant demonstrated historical dominance. Another potential limitation is that in this study all systemic estrogen supplementation was examined together. Oral estrogen administration undergoes first-pass liver metabolism that has been shown to increase markers of inflammation and C-reactive protein. Earlier studies have suggested that perhaps transdermal estrogen supplementation has the greatest anti-inflammatory influence. Unfortunately, the cross-sectional nature of the N3C precludes detailed granularity around medication route or dosing and longitudinal use. It has been suggested that cardiovascular and stroke risk may be increased in women during the first year after HRT discontinuation; if patients noted to be on HRT 24 months before their COVID diagnosis subsequently discontinued therapy, they may paradoxically be at an increased risk, despite being misclassified as \u201cHRT exposed.\u201d However, HRT discontinuation would not be expected to differ substantially between the SOT and non-ISC cohorts, and our results were reproduced in a cohort restricted to HRT use in the last 6 months. Similarly, we do not have detailed information regarding changes in immunosuppression, or differential therapies used in managing outpatient or hospitalized COVID patients. We acknowledge these are important limitations and areas for future study. Another limitation is that based on data availability, our observation window begins at the time of a positive COVID test. Thus, the current study cannot comment on the potential risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection in those with and without HRT exposure. Further, although this represents the largest study of its kind to date, the number of SOTRs on HRT with a diagnosis of COVID during the study period was relatively small (n=322 for males, n=813 for females). This resulted in greater instability around the true point estimate for the association of HRT versus no HRT for each outcome in males and females (particularly so in the smaller subgroup analyses). Finally, while we restricted our population to adults \u226545 years (peri- or postmenopausal/andropausal), we did not have access to measured sex hormones, and it is possible that patients not taking exogenous HRT still had adequate endogenous testosterone or estrogen reserve. This would attenuate the relative benefit observed with HRT but would not be anticipated to differentially impact the non-ISC and SOT populations. Therefore, the differential benefit of HRT in the general and SOT populations we demonstrate is unlikely to relate to differences in endogenous sex hormone levels. Importantly, our results persisted in a smaller sensitivity analysis restricted to adults >55 years of age and therefore more likely to be truly post-andropause or menopause.
