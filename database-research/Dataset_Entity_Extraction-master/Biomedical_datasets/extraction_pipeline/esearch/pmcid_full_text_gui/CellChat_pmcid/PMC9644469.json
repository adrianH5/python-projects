However, most of these data were generated under physiological conditions, and thus overlooked the disease-related cell subtypes or phenotypes. Recent studies exploring neurologic diseases such as arteriovenous malformation and Alzheimer\u2019s disease have indicated that cellular phenotypes and functions could be altered during pathological events. In the context of ischemic stroke, a previous investigation interpreted the data on the basis of the physiological atlas and failed to identify new disease-related cell subtypes. To fill this gap, we reanalyzed the data generated from a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, and focused on identifying new disease-related EC subtypes or phenotypes under ischemic stroke condition. We successfully discovered a new EC subtype that highly expressed pan-EC marker genes and pro-angiogenic factors but underexpressed all the arteriovenous markers identified in the vascular cell atlas. This EC subtype also possessed high differentiation potency into known ECs. We thus named this new EC subtype \u201chealing EC.\u201d We further identified a key molecule Xbp1 that highly correlated with the phenotype of healing ECs. A series of in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo analyses confirmed the roles of Xbp1 in promoting angiogenesis.

For detailed assessment of endothelial cells at successive timepoints after MCAO surgery under different Xbp1 intervention conditions, we performed a series of immunofluorescence microscopic assays. We used rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (RECA-1) antibody to label the ECs and calculated the area of ECs under different conditions (Fig.\u00a05C). The area of ECs was considered the proportion of functional cerebral vessels after MCAO surgery.

However, the robustness of the results was still not satisfying considering the spatial heterogeneity of ischemic injury. The 2D brain slices could not guarantee the representativeness of the whole-brain lesion. To address this issue, we utilized a novel technology called SR-PCI that could capture the whole-brain vasculature at a high spatial resolution while enabling detailed analyses at the regional scale. The MCAO surgeries were conducted on the same one side, to ensure self-control comparison and avoid influence from individual vasculature differences. After reconstruction, we first inspected the overall appearance of the brain under different Xbp1 interventions. Intuitively, cerebral atrophy was the mildest in the lesion side of the ov-Xbp1 group, followed by the the NC and sh-Xbp1 groups (Fig.\u00a06A). The leptomeningeal vasculatures were also preserved the best in the ov-Xbp1 group, indicating a superior ability of collateral compensation (Fig.\u00a06A, middle), while the sh-Xbp1 group preserved the worst (Fig.\u00a06A, right). Three-dimensional (3D) skeletonization of cerebral vasculature showed that the whole-brain-scale blood supply largely varied across different Xbp1 intervention conditions. The conformations of vessels greatly impact their trophic functions. Specifically, the ov-Xbp1 group showed the best-preserved blood-supplying microvessels in the lesion-side corpus striatum with the best vascular network conformation (Fig.\u00a06B, middle), while sh-Xbp1 showed the worst (Fig.\u00a06B, right). The vessels supplying cerebral cortex also preserved the best in the ov-Xbp1 group, followed by the NC and sh-Xbp1 groups (Fig.\u00a06B, and Additional file 1: Fig. S4A). Interestingly, the microvessels were also enriched on the normal side in ov-Xbp1 group, indicating better angiogenesis even in the physiological condition (Fig.\u00a06B, middle). The further vascular diameter analysis confirmed the above conclusions. The newly formed microvessels in the lesioned corpus striatum of the ov-Xbp1 group resembled those of the normal side the best (Fig.\u00a06C, middle, and Additional file 1: Fig. S4B, C) with a diameter of\u2009~\u200940\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm, indicating the best trophic function preservation of this microvasculature.

The enlarged vessels in the lesioned side of sh-Xbp1 were possibly the obstructed vessels due to ischemic injury (Fig.\u00a06C, right, and Additional file 1: Fig. S4B, C). Similarly, the vascular surface area in the lesioned prefrontal cortex of the ov-Xbp1 group was also larger compared with the other two groups (Fig.\u00a06D and Additional file 1: Fig. S4D), indicating a better trophic supply in this encephalic region. Statistical analyses of the whole-brain vasculature further confirmed the above conclusions, while the number of vascular nodes and segments were significantly higher in the ov-Xbp1 group and significantly lower in the sh-Xbp1 group (Fig.\u00a06E, F, \u2009P<\u20090.0001).

Next, we would like to explore the extrinsic pathways influencing EC subtypes. We exploited a widely used tool, CellChat, which utilizes manually curated database based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and primary literature to infer cell communications. To ensure the comprehensive analysis of cell communications, we integrated the data of EC subtypes and other cells. Compared with the sham condition, the number of interactions between cells generally increased while the interaction strength was impaired (Additional file 1: Figs. S5A S6A, B). The overall statistics confirmed this phenomenon (Additional file 1: Fig. S6C). Specifically, the number of interactions increased mostly owing to the increased receiving pathways in monocytes, suggesting an immune activation process under post-24\u00a0h MCAO condition. On the contrary, the EC subtypes were more likely to be a signal sender under post-24\u00a0h MCAO condition, including healing and venous ECs (Additional file 1: Figs. S5A and S6A, B). To understand the activated communication pathways in detail, we compared the relative information flow in the endothelial cells under sham or MCAO conditions. The main activated pathways enriched in endothelial cells included mainly pro-inflammatory pathways (MHC-I, IFN-II, TNF, CCL, CXCL) and angiogenesis-related pathways (SEMA3, ANGPT, OSM, ANGPTL, SPP1) under MCAO condition (Additional file 1: Fig. S5B). Both healing and venous ECs showed enrichment in the ANGPTL pathway as a signaling sender (Additional file 1: Figs. S5C and S6D). By analyzing the detailed roles played by each cells, we found that healing ECs and SMCs were most important cells that influenced and sent ANGPT signaling, and that most EC subtypes (except capillary EC) were major receivers (Additional file 1: Fig. S5D). Consistently, the expression of Angpt2 was upregulated in healing ECs and SMCs, while the receptor Tek was more lowly expressed in capillary ECs (Additional file 1: Fig. S5G). We thereafter performed similar analyses on ANGPTL (Additional file 1: Fig. S5E, H), SEMA3 (Additional file 1: Fig. S5F), and OSM (Additional file 1: Fig. S6E) pathways; all these pathways showed high participation of EC subtypes, especially healing and venous ECs. Collectively, these results indicated that EC subtypes profoundly participated in the cell communication process under post-24\u00a0h MCAO condition, mainly by introducing pro-inflammatory signals and pro-angiogenic pathways.

Previous studies have investigated angiogenesis after ischemic stroke. Endothelial cells, a prominent cell type in brain vasculature, modulate angiogenesis in two patterns: sprouting and intussusceptive. For sprouting angiogenesis, the endothelial cells sprout and form a tip that further becomes a newly formed vessel, while for intussusceptive angiogenesis, the splitting and extending endothelial cells form a new lumen inside the pre-existing vessels, which finally become a new vessel. Owing to the heterogeneity of ECs, the physiological brain vascular single-cell atlas has been established on the basis of human and mouse samples, in which the zonation pattern of ECs was found in the brain. Several cell markers of endothelial cells were thus identified, including artery, capillary, and venous ECs. These previously defined cell markers largely expedite the knowledge in several cerebral diseases, including arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, at a single-cell scale, which identified a capillary-associated variant of ECs and tip-like ECs, respectively. A recent study further identified venous ECs as the main effector EC subtype promoting angiogenesis in the retinal ischemic mouse model. We thus wondered whether similar mechanisms were involved after brain ischemia.

Via spatial\u2013temporal analysis of all the highly variable genes, we identified Xbp1 as the putative molecule. Previous studies have shown that Xbp1 was involved in VEGF signaling and spliced Xbp1 could regulate EC proliferation and angiogenesis in the retina, skeletal muscle, cardiac, and cerebral vasculature. For example, inhibition of the kinase activity of IRE1\u03b1, which is responsible for the unconventional splicing of Xbp1, or downregulation of Xbp1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) dramatically reduced the tube formation on angiogenesis assay. In isoproterenol\u00a0(ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy mouse models, myocardial capillary density and the expression of VEGF-A were significantly decreased after sh-Xbp1 treatment. In addition, spliced Xbp1 could upregulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme and regulate its cellular location, contributing to EC migration and angiogenesis. Intriguingly, Xbp1 can also serve as the downstream target of VEGF signaling. Karali et\u00a0al. reported that VEGF could activate mTORC1 via phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3, leading to the activation of IRE1\u03b1 and increased levels of spliced Xbp1 in HUVECs. More strikingly, a previous study constructed Xbp1 global knockout or EC conditional knockout mouse models and revealed that spliced Xbp1 was involved in angiogenesis during embryonic development and retinal vasculogenesis angiogenesis in ischemic muscle tissues. In detail, VEGF induces internalization of KDR and its interaction with IRE1\u03b1, leading to the phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1. Spliced Xbp1 then facilitates EC cell proliferation in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin/E2F2-dependent manner and also promotes EC cell size increase. Several in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiments confirmed its roles in promoting angiogenesis, not only under cerebral ischemia condition (Fig.\u00a05), but also possibly under physiological condition (Fig.\u00a04). Notably, from the literature discussed above, it seems that only the spliced form of Xbp1 can promote angiogenesis, which is a highly active transcription factor. Further, several studies investigated the therapeutic potentials of targeting Xbp1 and showed that aptamer-conjugated Xbp1 siRNA nanoparticles or scAAV2 vectors encoding the Xbp1 siRNAs could efficiently impair angiogenesis and suppress tumor growth in breast cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66121, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In\u00a0vitro experiments in the plate and in\u00a0vivo experiments on brain slices mostly detected the vessel network in a two-dimensional (2D) scale, which may cause bias due to lack of three-dimensional (3D) interconnection and different slice selection, respectively. To overcome the shortcoming, we introduced an SR-PCI method that ensured high-resolution 3D vasculature imaging at whole-brain and regional scales. The SR X-ray sources can provide high-resolution imaging of thick tissues. Meanwhile, SR-PCI utilizes X-ray phase shift, and thus it is far more sensitive to the refraction of X-rays than conventional X-ray absorption imaging. Therefore, SR-PCI is particularly suitable for the detection of delicate biological microstructures without the need for contrast agents. This advanced imaging technique has been used for the 3D visualization of the neuronal network and microvascular network in mouse spinal cord. Microvessels with a diameter reaching 10\u00a0\u03bcm can be discriminated using SR-PCI. We successfully detected the overall change of vasculature in the MCAO model under different Xbp1 interference conditions. The 3D rendering of whole-brain and regional vasculature indicated higher angiogenesis activity in the Xbp1-overexpressed group. Furthermore, the microvasculature in the lesioned site recovered the best under MCAO condition in the ov-Xbp1 group, especially in the corpus striatum and prefrontal cortex, suggesting a spatial specificity of Xbp1 in promoting angiogenesis. The phenomenon remains elusive, and may be elucidated by spatial RNA-seq technology in the future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67715, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67727, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Endothelial cells are major effector cells modulating angiogenesis after the occurrence of MCAO. A previously generated mouse cerebral vascular atlas has indicated the heterogeneity of endothelial cells under physiological conditions. Herein, by reanalyzing the previously published MCAO single-cell datasets, we successfully identified a novel disease-related EC subtype named \u201chealing EC.\u201d Healing ECs possessed the pan-EC marker and pro-angiogenic genes but underexpressed all the arteriovenous zonation markers. This EC subtype also possessed a high stemness and a tendency to differentiate into other EC subtypes. Via in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo validation, the predicted molecule Xbp1 was thus confirmed as a key pro-angiogenic modulator under both physiological and pathological conditions. Meticulous 3D whole-brain vasculature analyses further confirmed the roles of Xbp1 in promoting angiogenesis and recovering normal vasculature conformation. Cell communication analyses further determined the important roles of ECs in cell communication under MCAO conditions, especially with healing and venous ECs as message senders of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 68906, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Information",
