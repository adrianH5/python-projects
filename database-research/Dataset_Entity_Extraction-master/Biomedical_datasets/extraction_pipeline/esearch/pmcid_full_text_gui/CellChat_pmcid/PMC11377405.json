These cells were visualized using the UMAP and classified into 35 Seurat clusters using unsupervised clustering (Fig.\u00a01A). The cell clusters were differentiated based on three primary histological types, including GNB, GN, and NB, with NB exhibiting a significant dominance (Fig.\u00a01D). Cell types were identified using marker genes, and eight main types were recognized, namely B-plasma, T-NK, Myeloid cells, NE cells, Proliferating cells, pCDS, Hematopoietic precursor cells, and Erythroid lineage cells (Fig.\u00a01C). Additionally, we analyzed the cell cycle of NB and observed that most cell types were in the G1 phase, while the lower right corner (mainly NE cells and Proliferating cells) predominantly occupied the G2M and S phases (Fig.\u00a01B).

A correlation analysis was performed to determine the proportion of cell types among all patient samples corresponding to the three primary histological types. It was found that NE cells were scarce in GNB and GN, but they were more prevalent in NB. Notably, M2a and M3 samples exhibited a distinct specificity in terms of NE cell proportion (Fig.\u00a01F). Comparing high-malignant NB with low-malignant GNB and benign GN, it became evident that NE cells were exclusive to NB, which piqued our interest.

We visualized the scRNA-seq data using UMAP, presenting Seurat clusters, phases, groups, and orig.ident. Notably, the C1 subgroup was predominantly placed in the G2M and S phases, indicating its highly active state (Fig.\u00a02A). To assess the malignancy of the cells, we performed inferCNV analysis and determined NE cells were malignant cells using T-NK cells as reference cells. And the malignancy degree of the four NE cell subsets was further determined.\u00a0We observed chromosomal alterations such as Chr2 gain (C1-C4), Chr7 gain (C0, C1, C3), and Chr17 gain or Chr1 loss (Fig.\u00a02B). The CNV indicated a high degree of malignancy in NE cells, particularly in the C1 subgroup, which displayed pronounced specificity and held significant research value. Subsequently, we showed the differential genes of the four subgroups (Fig.\u00a02C). Moreover, the specific expression levels of marker genes in these subgroups were also described (Fig.\u00a02D). The word cloud map showed the enrichment of differential genes in each subgroup. Notably, the GATA3 was primarily enriched in the C0 subgroup, while the C1 subgroup highly enriched the AURKB and CDT1. The NRP1 was most significant in the C2 subgroup, while the CCNB1, CDCAB, and BIRC5 were highly enriched in the C3 subgroup (Fig.\u00a02E). AURKB promoted the transition from metaphase to telophase, effectively prolonging telophase and facilitating malignant cell proliferation and deterioration. Similarly, CDT1 played a crucial role in maintaining cell cycle and genome stability. To study further, we employed the bubble chart to demonstrate the tumor stem genes of the four subgroups and their relation to the G1, G2M, and S stages. Notably, the KDM5B and CD44 genes were primarily associated with the G1 phase, while the CTNNB1 and HIF1A genes were linked to the G2 phase, and the NES and SOX2 genes were connected to the S phase (Fig.\u00a02F, G).

Research indicates that PCLAF is closely associated with several malignancies, including prostate cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, and gastric adenocarcinoma, serving as a crucial regulator in cancer initiation and progression. Overexpression of PCLAF in NB is correlated with a poor prognosis, promoting NB cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 45501, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In recent years, numerous cell death-oriented cancer therapy studies have emerged, offering new avenues for exploring novel cancer treatment methods. Research suggests that cuproptosis is a copper-dependent form of cell death that occurs through direct binding of copper to the lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, leading to\u00a0lipoylated protein aggregation and subsequent iron-sulfur cluster protein loss, and these ultimately lead to proteotoxic stress, causing cell death. it is potentially implicated in the development of various cancers. Studies have shown that it is maybe related to the prognosis of cancer. In NB, some cuproptosis-related genes can promote the invasion, proliferation, and metastasis of NB by regulating the cell cycle. We observed that C1 PCLAF\u2009+\u2009NE cells scored highly in cuproptosis; the scores of other subgroups were low. Combined with the relevant characteristics of cuproptosis, we can infer that it can be used as a potential target for cancer treatment. To investigate the mechanisms of NB occurrence and progression, we initially employed CellChat to explore intercellular interactions and communication networks among various cell types within NB. We found that the MK signaling pathway was secreted in NE cells, indicating that it was a very important signaling pathway. In addition, the MK signaling pathway showed a high centrality score in C1 PCLAF\u2009+\u2009NE cells, which confirmed the strong association between this signaling pathway and this subpopulation. We also conducted in-depth studies on the ligand receptor pair MDK-NCL of the MK signaling pathway. Malignant cells mainly interacted with each other through the MDK-NCL pathway, which could promote tumor invasion. Midkine (MK), a heparin-binding growth factor with a protein molecular weight of 13\u00a0kDa, is shown to play roles in development, inflammation, and tissue protection. It is highly expressed in various cancers, including NB. The MDK-NCL interaction has been implicated in cancers such as endometrial and lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its role in NB as well. Thus, the MK signaling pathway and the MDK-NCL ligand-receptor pair can be a promising therapeutic target.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47709, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Additionally, we investigated NB-related metabolic conditions. Among all NB cell types, NE cells exhibited the highest specificity in the Oxidative Phosphorylation metabolic pathway. Within NE cells, the C1 PCLAF\u2009+\u2009NE cells prominently expressed both Oxidative Phosphorylation and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis pathways. Oxidative Phosphorylation refers to the process where the oxidation of organic substances (such as sugars, fats, and amino acids) releases energy to drive ATP synthesis. Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is broken down into pyruvate in the cytoplasm under anaerobic conditions, producing ATP. Gluconeogenesis, on the other hand, maintains blood glucose levels during fasting. Malignant cells can switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to adapt to changing metabolic environments. Thus, it is evident that C1 PCLAF\u2009+\u2009NE cells not only provide the necessary energy for cell survival, proliferation, synthesis, and signal transduction through oxidative phosphorylation but also sustain energy supply under anaerobic and nutrient-deprived conditions, contributing to the formation of a Regarding Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, tumor cells underwent metabolic reprogramming, favoring a \u201cglycolysis-dominated\u201d state, which provided energy for the tumor cells and created a TME.
