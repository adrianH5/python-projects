A recent review highlighted that numerous varicocele-related studies involving both animal models and human patients, consistently reported an abnormal increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1 and TNF-\u03b1, within seminal plasma, testicular tissue, and peripheral blood. These observations emphasize the involvement of these cytokines in activating potential inflammatory pathways in testicular cells. In another study focusing on chromium-induced testicular toxicity in male rats, the pro-inflammatory roles of IL1, IL6, IL10, and TNF-\u03b1 in testicular cells were also mentioned. The IL6 signaling pathway network mainly affected non-spermatogenic cells, with early primary spermatocytes being the primary targets among spermatogenic cells. The TNF and IFN-II signaling pathways networks revealed that all testicular cells influenced macrophages. Previous studies have also demonstrated that elevated levels of IL1, IL6, CCL, TNF, and IFN-II in semen are associated with decreased sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology.

Researchers have observed significantly higher IL2 levels in the testes of LPS sepsis rats compared to the normal control group. Another study has also suggested that the reduction of IL1 and IL2 levels by lycopene may contribute to the improvement of hypoxia-induced testicular injury. Although the etiology of the CS varies, these findings are consistent with our research.
