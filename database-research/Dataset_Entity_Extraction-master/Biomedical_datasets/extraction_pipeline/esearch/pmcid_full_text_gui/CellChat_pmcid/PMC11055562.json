This disease is characterized by the formation of plaques within arterial walls, which can lead to life-threatening events such as heart attacks, and strokes. Stroke, a consequence of AS with high mortality and disability rates worldwide, affects 30 million people and poses a significant threat to human health. Approximately 795,000 people in the United States experience a new or recurrent stroke annually, 87% of which are ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes, are caused by advanced atherosclerotic plaque (AAS), surface erosion, and rupture, often without warning, lead to significant adverse ischemic events (IE). Hence, early detection and prediction of AS plaque instability are crucial. With the deepening of AS-related research, we noticed that the biological properties of macrophages are key to determining lesion size, composition, and instability in AS plaque. There are significant differences in immune cell infiltration between early atherosclerotic plaque (EAS) and advanced atherosclerotic plaque. Macrophages in AS plaques demonstrate significant variability and adaptability, modulating their microenvironment through mechanisms such as elevated lipid concentrations, deregulated cytokine functions, hypoxia, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress and inflammation are interconnected processes that establish a strong feed-forward cycle, accelerating the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. A previous study has indicated that excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), a byproduct of oxidative stress, inflict damage on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), proteins, and lipids. These damages have been observed to escalate during AS progression, influencing whether the system activates or remains unresponsive and ultimately affecting the stability of AS plaques. Additionally, the risk of plaque rupture is significantly influenced by inflammatory responses, which are driven by interactions among lipoproteins, monocytes, and various macrophage subtypes. It\u2019s crucial to acknowledge a significant dilemma in current AS research, namely, the evident heterogeneity within the atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment. This heterogeneity primarily stems from the diverse biological functions of macrophage subtypes. Simply classifying them as M1/M2 types cannot adequately elucidate the mechanism of action of macrophage subtypes in AAS and is likely to produce deviation. Therefore, it is urgent to conduct in-depth research on more effective classification characteristics of AS plaque subtypes and macrophage subtypes, in order to accurately identify patients who will suffer from adverse ischemic events.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5349, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Conventional imaging techniques, focusing on plaque appearance and size, are insufficient for predicting rupture risk and acute thrombotic events. Macrophage heterogeneity within AS plaques has become a focal point of recent research. High-throughput sequencing technologies such as transcriptome analysis (bulk-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have provided deep insights into the complexity and dynamic nature of atherosclerotic lesions. In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, which focuses primarily on identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different groups, scRNA-seq offers diverse perspectives on heterogeneity, cellular interactions, and transcriptome changes, crucial for understanding disease progression. It also enables the identification of distinct cell populations, including various immune cell subtypes within the disease, and offers an in-depth understanding of their roles in disease progression. However, scRNA-seq\u2019s high cost, small sample size, and limited clinical follow-up information may bias results. Bulk-seq complements single-cell analysis, providing a comprehensive view of gene expression patterns across large cell populations within atherosclerotic tissue. Integrating data from both single-cell and bulk-seq allows for a more holistic understanding of the pathological processes in AS. It also aids in identifying key biomarkers and therapeutic targets for predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and personalized treatment strategies, in line with the Predictive, Preventive, and Personalized Medicine (PPPM) model. Partial scRNA-seq analysis has elucidated the transcriptomic profiles of immune cell subpopulations in AS. However, the prognostic significance of macrophage subtypes and their cellular interactions during AS progression, especially in unstable plaque subtypes, remain poorly understood. Therefore, examining the metabolic features and phenotypic changes in dysregulated macrophage subpopulations linked to AS plaque subtypes, along with identifying more robust diagnostic biomarkers, holds significant clinical importance.

This analysis revealed distinct clustering of 131 carotid atherosclerotic plaques into three clusters: cluster 1, cluster 2, and cluster 3. Intriguingly, DEIRGs demonstrated significantly increased expression in the cluster 3 plaque subtype. Notably, most plaques linked to ischemic events were categorized within this cluster. Furthermore, DEIRGs showed reduced expression in cluster 2, whereas cluster 1 exhibited expression levels intermediate to both clusters (Figure 2A). This finding has not been observed in prior similar studies. Survival analysis demonstrated significant prognostic differences among the three subtypes, with cluster 3 plaque subtype exhibiting markedly lower ischemic event-free survival (p-value < 0.01) (Figure 2B). PCA results further indicated distinct separation among the three clusters, suggesting diverse features and functions among three plaque subtypes (Figure 2C). Through ssGSEA of the immune landscape, we observed increased infiltration of 28 immune cell types in the cluster 3 plaque subtype. In contrast, the lowest infiltration was noted in cluster 2, with cluster 1 exhibiting intermediate levels (Figure 2D). This variation in immune cell infiltration corresponded with the DEIRGs expression patterns across three AS plaque subtypes, suggesting a potential link between the cluster 3 subtype and more prevalent immune inflammatory responses. Moreover, by employing hallmark gene sets, we evaluated the biological functions of the different plaque subtypes. Consistently, the cluster 3 subtype showed increased expression in several immune-inflammatory signatures, such as apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, complement activation, fatty acid metabolism, hypoxia, and inflammation (p-value < 0.05). Conversely, no significant differences or lower expression were observed in signatures related to cholesterol homeostasis and EMT (Figure 2E). Given the evident biological functional differences between cluster 3 and the other two clusters, we designated cluster 3 as the Differentially Expressed Macrophage-Related Genes (DEMGs) cluster, while clusters1 and 2 were defined as non-DEMGs clusters. GSVA analysis revealed that the DEMGs cluster was implicated in various immune cell-related signaling pathways, while non-DEMGs clusters were associated with EMT-related signaling pathways, such as vascular smooth muscle contraction and cell adhesion aggregation (Figure 2F and Supplementary Figure 2). Additionally, we assessed the expression of immune checkpoint-related genes in the DEMGs and Non-DEMGs clusters, and as anticipated, multiple immune checkpoint genes were upregulated in the DEMGs cluster, suggesting a more intense immune cell response and inflammatory gene expression in this cluster (Figure 2G).

Following data processing and quality control procedures, a total of 54,701 single cells were subjected to subsequent analysis. The major cell-type annotation was performed based on the \u201cSingleR\u201d package and classical gene markers to identify cell types. Ultimately, we identified eight major cell types, including B cells, myeloid cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, T cells, NK cells, and mast cells (Figure 4A). The major cell-type atlas showed a significant increase in myeloid cells within the AS group (Figure 4B), and the quality control results for the nine single-cell samples indicated no apparent heterogeneity between samples. The mRNA quantity and mitochondrial ratio in each sample were controlled within a reasonable range (Figure 4C). Additionally, we observed significant changes in cell distribution in the AS compared to the normal group: myeloid cells and T cells increased markedly, whereas endothelial cells and fibroblasts showed a notable decrease in distribution proportions (Figure 4D and E). To assess the impact of gene changes in major cell types between the AS and normal groups, hierarchical clustering was performed based on the expression changes of major cell type genes relative to the normal group. The results clearly indicated an aggregation of these eight major cell types in the AS group (Figure 4F). Moreover, there were similar transcriptional features between the AS and normal groups, further confirming the accuracy of our cell-type annotation. Furthermore, using the 43 DEMGs, we calculated enrichment scores for eight major cell types employing the \u201cAddModuleScore\u201d function.

Through literature searches and the identification of classical gene markers, we successfully annotated a total of ten myeloid subtypes. These include classical monocytes, DC1 cells, DC2 cells, DC3 cells, SPP1+/VCAN+ macrophages (Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN), SPP1+ macrophages (Mac-C2-SPP1), IL1B+ macrophages (Mac-C3-IL1B), TREM2+ macrophages (Mac-C4-TREM2), FLT3LG+ macrophages (Mac-C5-FLT3LG), and monocyte-like macrophages (Monolike Mac). As illustrated in Figure 5A, we employed multiple classical gene markers to annotate these ten myeloid subtypes. Notably, the classical gene markers for SPP1+/VCAN+ macrophages and SPP1+ macrophages exhibited significantly higher expression in the AS group, suggesting these two macrophages may be AS-induced. Previous literature has reported the unique functions of SPP1+ macrophages, including slowed cholesterol clearance, enhanced vascularization, and glycosylation effects. Interestingly, the gene expression profile of Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN not only include the classical gene markers of SPP1+ macrophage but also includes inflammatory, angiogenesis and lipid generation-related genes, such as EREG, VCAN, and AQP9. These results implied that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN may represent a novel macrophage subtype with more intense inflammatory and angiogenesis reactions based on SPP1+ macrophage subtype. Additionally, the single-cell atlas indicates that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN is closer in distance to Mac-C3-IL1B and Mac-C5-FLT3LG, suggesting potential functional similarities and closer cell connections among these three subtypes (Figure 5B). Concurrently, as depicted in Supplementary Figure 3, the distribution of Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG gradually increases in AS. However, the distribution patterns of these subtypes in nine single-cell samples suggest a decrease in these three macrophage subtypes in AS. We attribute this result to these three macrophage subtypes being relatively rare cell types in AS4, AS5, and AS6 samples, with an uneven proportion of each AS sample compared to normal groups. The higher number of AS samples may have statistically diluted the proportion of these rare macrophage subtypes (Figure 5C). Based on the previously identified 43 DEMGs, we conducted a subsequent enrichment scoring for these ten myeloid subtypes (Figure 5D). Interestingly, we observed a significant upregulation of DEMGs scores in Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG, suggesting that these three macrophage subtypes may contribute to the increased instability of plaques. Single-cell pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on fifty hallmark gene sets, focusing on the ten identified subtypes of myeloid cells. The results indicate that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN is significantly upregulated in angiogenesis, while oxidative phosphorylation and oxygen responses are significantly downregulated. Mac-C3-IL1B is significantly upregulated in angiogenesis, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, inflammatory response, and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. Mac-C5-FLT3LG is significantly upregulated in NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and apoptosis (Figure 5E). These findings suggest that these three macrophage subtypes may primarily exert biological functions such as angiogenesis, regulation of immune inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. We also conducted enrichment scoring for three AS-related pathways embedded in the UMAP plot: fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, and hypoxia.

We conducted further pseudo-trajectory analysis to investigate the dynamic immune states and cellular differentiation trajectories of these macrophage subtypes. Simultaneously, we utilized two algorithms, \u201cCytoTRACE\u201d and \u201cMonocle2\u201d, to mutually validate and infer the developmental initiation stages of the macrophages. Impressively, two distinct activation paths emerged, suggesting a three-state differentiation process for the macrophage subtypes, namely state1, state2, and state3 (Figure 6A). Both algorithms indicated that state2 represents the initiation stage of development, characterized by generally high stemness scores and the earliest development onset. State2 then differentiates into state1 and state3 via node1. We defined these three states inferred from the trajectory distribution as Pre-branch, Cell fate 1, and Cell fate 2. Notably, significant differences in the distribution of macrophage subtypes were observed under different activation paths. Specifically, Pre-branch was mainly dominated by Monolike Mac and Mac-C4-TREM2, Cell fate 1 was mainly dominated by Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN and Mac-C2-SPP1, and Cell fate 2 was mainly dominated by Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG (Figure 6A). Ridgeline plot indicates that among the macrophage subtypes, those in the Pre-branches show the earliest activation in development time. In contrast, the subtype under Cell Fate 1 exhibits the latest activation. The subtype (Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG) associated with Cell Fate 2, on the other hand, displays activation at a mid-to-late stage in the development timeline (Figure 6B). Consistent with expectations, pseudo-trajectory analysis of the AS-related pathways revealed that as pseudo-trajectory time progressed, AS group showed increasing expression scores in four pathways: angiogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and hypoxia. In contrast, the normal group exhibited the opposite trend. Interestingly, Cell fate 2 also demonstrated the highest expression scores in these four pathways, showing a similar expression trend to the AS group (Figure 6C). This finding suggests a key role of these three macrophage subtypes within Cell fate 2 in AS formation. Furthermore, we assessed the enrich trends of DEMGs scores across the three stages. Surprisingly, the DEMGs scores gradually increased along the activation trajectory of Cell fate groups and were significantly higher in Cell fate 2 than in Cell fate 1/Pre-branch (p < 0.0001) (Figure 6D). Subsequently, we investigated the transcriptional changes associated with the differentiation state of DEMGs and observed that, except for DPP4, PTGS1, LAPTM5, and TMC6, the gene expression trends of other DEMGs gradually upregulated with pseudo-trajectory time change, mirroring the expression trend of Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG macrophage subtypes (Figure 6E). Additionally, our SCENIC analysis of macrophage subtypes revealed that their regulons can be categorized into five distinct modules, as shown in Figure 6F. Each specific macrophage subtype exhibited unique TF regulons. Notably, TFs such as E2F3/6/7, ATF2/4, JUNB, IRF1/7, FOS, and ELF1known for their involvement in cell cycle regulation, cellular stress responses, IFN signaling pathways, and immune modulation, were found to be highly activated in Cell fate 2 (Figure 6G). This suggests a nuanced regulatory landscape in these macrophage subtypes, emphasizing their functional diversity in cellular processes. Collectively, tracing gene fluctuations along the bifurcated trajectory, Cell fate 2 appears to play a key role in pathways closely associated with AS, such as angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and hypoxia. Additionally, DEMGs score exhibit the highest in Cell fate 2, suggesting selective high expression in Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG macrophage subtypes. These macrophage subtypes in Cell fate 2 may be key cell types leading to plaque rupture in AS, resulting in decreased ischemic event-free survival.

Thus, we utilized BEAM analysis to identify the DEGs associated with Cell fate 2. The GO Term results reveal that DEGs with Cell fate 2 are predominantly expressed in pathways related to immune-inflammatory responses, including immune cell receptor signaling pathways, positive regulation of the immune response, and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Figure 7A). Concurrently, Cell fate 1\u2019s DEGs were found to be linked to cell recognition, cell signal transduction, and ATP synthesis. Further survival analysis demonstrated that high enrichment scores of Cell fate 2\u2019s DEG could predict the occurrence of ischemic events in the AS patient cohort, suggesting that these macrophages within the Cell fate 2 can markedly reduce the prognosis of cardiovascular disease patients (Figure 7B). We further investigated the tissue distribution of these macrophages within the Cell fate 2 using a large pair of samples. Intriguingly, in two independent datasets of AAS, a higher enrichment score of Cell fate 2 was observed in AAS (Figure 7C). Additionally, through bulk-seq analysis, significant expression differences were observed among the 41 DEGs of Cell fate 2 across different AS plaque subtypes. Specifically, in the cluster 3 plaque subtype, Cell fate 2\u2019s DEGs exhibited high expression, whereas they exhibited low expression in the cluster 2 subtype and intermediate expression in the cluster 1 subtype (Figure 7D). This finding suggests that these macrophages within Cell fate 2 are likely crucial components of the cluster 3 plaque subtype. Subsequently, we conducted a metabolic pathway analysis for these three states of macrophage subtypes. The results indicated significant upregulation of fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid elongation, and fatty acid degradation pathways in the Cell fate 2 (Figure 7E and F). Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis revealed that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN has relevant functions in both inflammation and lipid metabolism (Figure 7E and G). We implied that the inflammatory response of these macrophages within the Cell fate 2 group is one of the factors contributing to the overactivation of lipid metabolism. Existing research indicates a correlation between excessive fatty acid elongation and the development of AS, where fatty acids in the body can transform into pro-inflammatory metabolites, triggering inflammation and exacerbating vascular wall damage. In summary, these results support the likelihood that macrophage subtypes within Cell fate 2 accumulate in lesions and play a crucial role in the progression and prognosis of atherosclerosis.

A heatmap of intercellular correlations reveals a significant positive correlation (p-value < 0.05) between Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN and Mac-C3-IL1B, in line with expectations (Figure 8B). Notably, a positive correlation is observed between Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN and NK cells and mast cells, suggesting potential immunoregulatory and cytotoxic functions, consistent with prior findings (Figure 7G). Interestingly, survival analysis based on the proportion of Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN indicates a marked reduction in the ischemic event-free survival for high cell proportion (p-value < 0.0001) (Figure 8C). Furthermore, the clustering heatmap of AS plaque subtypes reveals that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG exhibit high infiltration proportions in cluster 3 plaques, low infiltration proportions in cluster 2 plaques, and moderate infiltration proportions in cluster 1 plaques, consistent with our earlier findings (Figures 8D and 7D).

In summary, we have identified the transcriptional features of these three macrophage subtypes in cluster 3 plaques and discovered that the high infiltration proportions of two macrophage subtypes (Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN and Mac-C3-IL1B) are a crucial factor contributing to plaque instability.

In group comparison, we found significantly augmented interactions among macrophage subtypes in AS, particularly for Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG (Figure 9C). Subsequently, we delved into exploring the ligand-receptor pairs involving Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, Mac-C5-FLT3LG, and other macrophage subtypes. We found a significant upregulation of ligand-receptor pairs inducing inflammatory responses and participating in immune regulation and angiogenesis in AS, such as SPP1 and its partners, MIF and its partners, and ANXA1-FRP1 (Figure 9D). Notably, SPP1, as a cytokine, plays a vital role in the type-I immune response by enhancing the production of IFN and IL12 and reducing the production of IL10. The expression of its ligand-receptor pairs in Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN is significantly higher than in the other two macrophage subtypes. Similar trends were observed for MIF and its partners. MIF, a pivotal regulatory protein in the immune system, stimulates inflammation and immune responses, participates in the directed movement of immune cells, and regulates cell proliferation, impacting endothelial cell growth and differentiation. These findings support the inference that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN cells exhibit more inflammatory responses and angiogenesis. Additionally, we investigated the roles of different cells in the SPP1 signaling pathway, ANNEXIN signaling pathway, and MIF signaling pathway. This revealed that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN tends to act as a ligand cell in these three pathways, while Mac-C3-IL1B and Mac-C5-FLT3LG tend to act as ligands in the ANNEXIN signaling pathway and as receptors in the other two pathways (Figure 9E\u2013G).

Earlier research centered on macrophage polarization, exploring biological functions, inflammatory genes, and signaling pathways of M1 or M2 macrophages. However, as research on AS deepened, the complexity of macrophage heterogeneity in AS requires moving beyond this binary classification. The detailed mechanism underlying how macrophage subtypes affect the microenvironment has been a prominent topic in recent years. We should notice that the AS plaque microenvironments present a complex landscape, especially when considering the transformational capabilities of macrophages. At the heart of this complexity lies the dynamic transformation between the M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes. Some research has illuminated that the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 2 plays a critical role in the transition of M2 macrophages from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory state. This transformational process further complicates the identification of unstable plaque characteristics. Moreover, traditional beliefs posited that macrophages originated solely from the differentiation of monocytes. However, recent studies have unveiled a more nuanced narrative. These studies suggest that resident macrophages are not merely byproducts of differentiation but are actively present at various stages within the plaque microenvironment. The behavior of these macrophage subtypes is intriguing: under steady-state conditions, they exhibit low levels of proliferation. Yet, when faced with inflammatory challenges, they demonstrate a marked increase in proliferation rates, significantly contributing to the accumulation of macrophages in plaques. Lastly, the phenotypic classification of macrophages has traditionally relied on the identification of surface markers and their associated functions. However, the issue arises from the fact that many of these markers are shared across different macrophage subtypes, with only a few being unique to specific phenotypes. This overlap not only blurs the functional distinctions between the subtypes but also introduces a degree of ambiguity and complexity in understanding their distinct roles in plaque formation and progression. In the present analysis, our results reveal different biological functions (eg, hypoxia, fatty acid metabolism, inflammatory response, cholesterol homeostasis) and clinical outcomes for macrophage subtypes, particularly in previously identified cluster 3 plaque subtypes. Although identifying macrophage subtypes\u2019 biological functions in AS is crucial, it\u2019s more important to understanding which subtypes contribute to plaque instability and to identify common traits of these macrophages in unstable plaque subtypes. Here, we identified three AS plaque subtypes using unsupervised clustering in bulk-seq data. revealing prognostic differences and transcriptomic characteristics linked to high immune cell infiltration and inflammatory response pathways in cluster 3 subtypes through survival analysis and GSVA methods. Additionally, we discovered that cluster 3 plaques exhibit high expression selectively associated with a specific macrophage subtype. This highlights the importance of actively identifying the molecular characteristics of different AS plaques in inflammation-targeted therapies, which could benefit patients with ischemic events-related plaques.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 69249, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Furthermore, using DEMGs as a bridge, three macrophage subtypes significantly associated with DEMGs score were identified (Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG). Pseudo-trajectory analysis further revealed various differentiation stages and specific biological functions of these macrophage subtypes. The Cell fate 2 group, marked by the highest DEMGs score, represents a differentiation stage formed by the aggregation of these three subtypes. It\u2019s appeared crucial for AS progression, as patients with high Cell fate 2 DEGs expression had poorer prognoses. The BayesPrism deconvolution method confirmed the high activity of these three macrophage subtypes and characteristic genes in cluster 3 plaque subtypes, validating our analysis. Our study also traced the origins of macrophage subtypes and the biofunctions of Cell fate 2. Consensus suggests that most macrophage subtypes likely originate from activated monocyte-like macrophages, as indicated by the trajectory from Pre-branch to Cell fate 2/Cell fate 1. Interestingly, our study revealed that Cell fate 2 macrophages are significantly enriched in pathways related to fatty lipid synthesis, hypoxia, apoptosis, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, with most DEMGs being highly expressed in these macrophage subtypes. This underscores their role in immune-inflammatory responses and their selectivity for pro-inflammatory and oxidized LDL (OxLDL)-related metabolic processes during differentiation. Previous studies have demonstrated that hypoxia can activate immune cells and increase energy demands of resident cells, creating a hypoxic microenvironment and mitochondrial dysfunction. This leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, and the activation of inflammation and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, which in turn, may secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, undermining plaque stability through extracellular matrix degradation. Oxidative stress also leads to the oxidation of both lipid and protein components in OxLDL, which plays a crucial role in AS formation due to its pro-inflammatory, chemotactic, and procoagulant properties. Moreover, OxLDL is pivotal in macrophage differentiation and foam cell formation, which are key processes in AS progression. Conversely, Cell fate 1\u2019s DEGs were found to be linked to cell recognition, cell signal transduction, and ATP synthesis, suggests a pivotal role in initial inflammatory responses, potentially contributing to the recruitment of further immune cells and the establishment of an inflammatory milieu conducive to plaque development. Our current findings and these previous studies help consolidate the evidence for a potential causal relationship between inflammation and AS and further explore potential macrophage subpopulations that may play an important role in the process of inflammation. Targeting specific macrophage states or modulating their evolutionary trajectories could offer novel strategies for treating AS. For example, therapies designed to inhibit the transition to Cell fate 2 or stay in the Pre-branch state could mitigate plaque progression or encourage plaque stabilization, respectively. Additionally, we identified a unique Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN cell, rare in quantity but exhibiting high expression of AS-related genes (CD36, AQP9, EREG). Unlike traditional SPP1+ macrophage, it expresses both SPP1 and VCAN genes, known to influence tumor invasion, metastasis, and recruit macrophages as inflammatory factors, while VCAN plays a vital role in angiogenesis in tumor invasion and heterogeneity. A previous study on tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells also identified angiogenesis-associated macrophages in 8 cancer types, marked by SPP1 expression. These findings suggest the existence of other functional SPP1+macrophages subtypes. In our study, Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN was not only highly expressed in cluster 3 plaque subtypes but also found to significantly lower the survival of ischemic events-free in AS. Cell communication analysis also revealed enhanced inter-macrophage interactions in AS. We noticed that Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN likely plays a pivotal role in regulating the entire inflammatory response and angiogenesis through pathways like SPP1 and MIF significantly intensified. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a prominent atypical chemokine (ACK), an evolutionarily conserved multifunctional inflammatory mediator that is structurally distinct from other cytokines. MIF may enhance the recruitment of atherogenic leukocytes via CXC motif chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), promoting atherosclerosis. Current data have indicated that MIF activates activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinases in synoviocytes and p38 MAPK, resembling other proinflammatory cytokines. MAPK activation can be well characterized as a feature of atherosclerotic inflammation. Furthermore, MIF is the only known cytokine that directly downregulates p53 expression and function, especially under cellular stress. If a small molecule MIF inhibitor can be developed, it could represent a new category of direct anti-cytokine drugs that would have potential utility in inflammatory diseases. Our findings align with these conclusions that MIF-related signaling pathways are actively expressed in pro-inflammatory, especially in Mac-C1-SPP1/VCAN as ligand, Mac-C3-IL1B, and Mac-C5-FLT3LG as receptors. Furthermore, in the ANXA1-FPR1 signaling pathway, inflammatory stimulation of the P2X7 receptors on macrophages leads to the release of the phospholipid-binding protein membrane associate protein A1 (ANXA1), which binds to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting the transport capacity of leukocytes effects. Leslie et al indicated the ANXA1-FPR1 signaling pathway could promote the maturation of macrophages and migrate them into the damaged tissue. Our results of activation in the ANXA1-FPR1 signaling pathway with Cell fate 2 macrophages as receptors were observed to imply that continuous inflammatory signals induce large amounts of inflammatory gene expressions in AS plaque to cause a series of inflammatory responses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 75522, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Moreover, we employed three machine learning algorithms to identify ten biomarkers expressed in plaque subtypes and macrophages, leading to the construction of a diagnostic model for AS. The reliability of the diagnostic model was assessed using ten machine learning algorithms and validation sets, with in vitro validation of three biomarkers (FCER1G, CD36 and VAMP8). By searching the literature, we found FCER1G encoding the Fc receptor \u03b3-chain, first informed as the third subunit of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, was abundantly expressed in different types of immune cells and involved in various types of immune responses such as phagocytosis and cytokine release. Youshi Meng et al proved that FCER1G is a hub gene significantly upregulated in AAS. However, FCER1G is still less studied in interactive mechanisms in AS. In our study, FCER1G was a highly expressed gene in Mac-C3-IL1B, proving FCER1G might be involved in inflammation-related signaling pathways by regulated Mac-C3-IL1B activity. CD36 belongs to the class B scavenger receptor family and is expressed on monocytes and macrophages. CD36, a pattern recognition receptor, is an important signaling molecule for the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), foam cell formation, cytoskeleton dynamics, and macrophage migration. Although uptake of ox-LDL by CD36 has been verified to be a critical step in foam cell formation, the mechanism regulating ligand-induced CD36 internalization and its corresponding downstream signaling remains unclear, so clarification of this regulatory mechanism may unexpectedly find the one of discovery of the emerging therapeutic strategies for AS. Data from the study by Sai Kuchibhotla et al indicated that CD36 deficiency not only reduced the level of lipid accumulation in macrophages to retard the progression of atherosclerosis but also reduced the secretion of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This pro-inflammatory cytokine affects plaque instability due to macrophage migration. These results are consistent with our findings and support the pro-atherogenic effect of CD36. VAMP8 is a SNARE protein that has been found in a variety of important cellular activities, which is critical for the fusion between the autophagosomes and lysosomes. Youwei Lu et al suggested that VAMP8 may promote the development of AS and be a new biomarker for diagnosing and treating AS.
