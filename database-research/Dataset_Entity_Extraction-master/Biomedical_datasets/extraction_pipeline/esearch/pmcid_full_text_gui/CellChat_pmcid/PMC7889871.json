To predict significant communications, CellChat identifies differentially over-expressed ligands and receptors for each cell group (Fig.\u00a01b; also see \u201cMethods\u201d section).

The latter is modeled by the law of mass action based on the average expression values of a ligand by one cell group and that of a receptor by another cell group, as well as their cofactors (see \u201cMethods\u201d scetion).

Network centrality analysis of the inferred TGF\u03b2 signaling network identified that several myeloid cell populations are the most prominent sources for TGF\u03b2 ligands acting onto fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a02a, b). Of note one myeloid population MYL-A is also the dominant mediator, suggesting its role as a gatekeeper of cell\u2013cell communication. These findings are consistent with the known critical role played by myeloid cells in initiating inflammation during skin wound healing and driving activation of skin-resident fibroblasts via TGF\u03b2 signaling. Importantly, CellChat also predicted that certain endothelial cell populations, as well as several fibroblast populations, both known sources of TGF\u03b2 ligands, significantly contribute to myeloid-dominated TGF\u03b2 signal production in the wound. This reveals that TGF\u03b2 signaling network in skin wounds is complex and highly redundant with multiple ligand sources targeting large portion of wound fibroblasts. Interestingly, CellChat shows that the majority of TGF\u03b2 interactions among wound cells are paracrine, with only one fibroblast and one myeloid population demonstrating significant autocrine signaling (Fig.\u00a02b). Notably, among all known ligand-receptor pairs, wound TGF\u03b2 signaling is dominated by Tgfb1 ligand and its multimeric Tgfbr1/Tgfbr2 receptor (Fig.\u00a02c). In contrast with TGF\u03b2, CellChat analysis of inferred ncWNT signaling network revealed its very distinct, non-redundant structure with only one ligand (Wnt5a) and only one population of fibroblasts (FIB-D) driving largely fibroblast-to-fibroblast, fibroblast-to-endothelial and to a lesser extent fibroblast-to-myeloid signaling (Fig.\u00a02d\u2013f). FIB-D cells highly expressed Crabp1 and were enriched for cell cycle genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d), which likely represent an actively cycling subset of Crabp1-positive cells in upper wound dermis.

To address this question, CellChat employs a pattern recognition method based on non-negative matrix factorization to identify the global communication patterns, as well as the key signals in different cell groups (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). The output of this analysis is a set of the so-called communication patterns that connect cell groups with signaling pathways either in the context of outgoing signaling (i.e., treating cells as senders) or incoming signaling (i.e., treating cells as receivers). Application of this analysis uncovered five patterns for outgoing signaling (Fig.\u00a02g) and five patterns for incoming signaling (Fig.\u00a02h). This output, for example, reveals that a large portion of outgoing fibroblast signaling is characterized by pattern #4, which represents multiple pathways, including but not limited to ncWNT, SPP1, MK, and PROS (Fig.\u00a02g). All of the outgoing myeloid cell signaling is characterized by pattern #2, representing such pathways as TGF\u03b2, TNF, CSF, IL1, and RANKL. On the other hand, the communication patterns of target cells (Fig.\u00a02h) shows that incoming fibroblast signaling is dominated by two patterns #1 and #3, which include signaling pathways such as TGF\u03b2 and ncWNT, as well as PDGF, TNF, MK, and PTN among others. Majority of incoming myeloid cell signaling is characterized by the pattern #4, driven by CSF and CXCL pathways. Notably, both incoming and outgoing signaling by Schwann cells share the same pattern #1 with wound fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a02g-h). These results show that: (1) two distinct cell types in the same tissue can rely on largely overlapping signaling networks; and that (2) certain cell types, such as fibroblasts, simultaneously activate multiple signaling patterns and pathways, while other cell types, such as myeloid cells or B cells, rely on fewer and more homogeneous communication patterns. Moreover, cross-referencing outgoing and incoming signaling patterns also provides a quick insight into the autocrine-acting vs. paracrine-acting pathways for a given cell type. For example, major autocrine-acting pathways between wound fibroblasts are MK, SEMA3, PROS, and ncWNT, and major paracrine-acting myeloid-to-fibroblasts pathways are TGF\u03b2 and TNF (Fig.\u00a02g-h).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20894, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Further, CellChat is able to quantify the similarity between all significant signaling pathways and then group them based on their cellular communication network similarity. Grouping can be done either based on functional or structural similarity (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). Application of functional similarity grouping identified four groups of pathways (Fig.\u00a02i). Group #1 is dominated by inflammatory pathways (e.g., TGF\u03b2, TNF, IL, CCL) and largely represents paracrine signaling from myeloid and endothelial cells to fibroblasts. Group #2, which includes ncWNT, EGF, GAS, and PROS pathways, largely represents autocrine signaling between wound fibroblasts. Group #3, which includes CXCL and APELIN pathways, represents signaling from endothelial cells, while group #4, which includes MK, PTN, and SPP1 pathways, represents promiscuous signaling (i.e., signaling with high connectivity) and is dominated by signals from certain fibroblast populations and myeloid cells. By identifying poorly studied pathways that group together with other pathways, whose role is well known, this CellChat analysis can predict putative functions of the former. Different from grouping on the basis of functional similarity, which heavily weighs in similarity between sender and receiver cell groups, grouping based on structural similarity is primarily driven by the similarity of signaling network topology (Fig.\u00a02j; see \u201cMethods\u201d section). Structural similarity grouping also identified four groups of signaling pathways (Fig.\u00a02k). Group #1 represents pathways that have very few senders and numerous receivers, such as ncWNT; group #2 represents pathways with numerous senders and receivers, such as TGF\u03b2 and PTN; group #3 represents pathways with numerous senders and few receivers, such as CCL and IL1; and group #4 represents pathways with few senders and few receivers, such as PROS, IL2, and CXCL. Thus, grouping based on structural similarity reveals general mode of how sender and receiver cells utilize a given signaling pathway.

First, we inferred pseudotemporal trajectories for dermal and epidermal embryonic skin cells using the diffusion map approach (Fig.\u00a03a-b; Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d; see \u201cMethods\u201d section).

A linear sequence of these trajectory groups recapitulates sequential stages of embryonic skin fibroblast lineage specification process (Fig.\u00a03a). Embryonic epidermal cell trajectory starts from basal epidermal cells and progresses either toward Edar-high epithelial placode cells or toward Krt1-high and Lor-high suprabasal epidermal cells.

Previous studies showed that activation of canonical WNT signaling is required for DC cell specification in the embryonic skin. Indeed, CellChat-inferred canonical WNT signaling network indicates that epidermal cells are the primary ligand source, which acts both in autocrine manner between epidermal cell populations, as well as in paracrine way from epidermal to dermal cells (Fig.\u00a03c). Notably, two WNT ligand-receptor pairs, namely Wnt6\u2013Fzd10/Lrp6 and Wnt6\u2013Fzd2/Lrp6 were the dominant contributors to this communication network (Fig.\u00a03d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a), which is consistent with the previous report that Wnt6 is the highest expressed canonical WNT ligand in embryonic mouse skin. Signaling communication network for ncWNT pathway differs substantially from that of canonical WNT pathway. Late stage fibroblast state FIB-E was the primary ncWNT source, signaling both in autocrine and paracrine manner (Fig.\u00a03e) with Wnt5a\u2013Fzd2 and Wnt5\u2013Fzd10 ligand-receptor pairs driving the signaling (Fig.\u00a03f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b\u2013c). These results suggest distinct roles for canonical WNT and ncWNT pathways in skin morphogenesis. In another example, we analyzed the FGF signaling network (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d\u2013h) and found it to be similar to the ncWNT signaling network, with the additional epithelial placode-derived Fgf20 signaling (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e and h).

Three DC states\u2014pre-DC, DC1, and DC2, and one placode state were identified (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e\u2013f; see \u201cMethods\u201d section). CellChat analysis on these four cell states identified placode cells as the dominant communication \u201chub\u201d, which secretes and receives signals via 44 and 19 ligand-receptor pairs, respectively (Fig.\u00a04b). Prominent bidirectional forward and reverse signals were identified for DC states, suggesting that the cell state transition along pre-DC-DC1-DC2 cell lineage trajectory is highly regulated. Specifically, FGF pathway exhibited abundant signaling interactions among all four states with FGF ligands being dominantly secreted by pre-DC and DC2 states (Fig.\u00a04c). Fgf10 was the major ligand contributing to dermal FGF signaling (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a), which is the known DC signature gene. Epithelial placode cells distinctly secreted Fgf20 both in autocrine and in paracrine manner to all three DC states (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a), which is consistent with the known role of placode-derived FGF20 signaling in hair follicle morphogenesis. For another major signaling pathway in early hair follicle morphogenesis\u2014canonical WNT, epithelial placode cells were the major source of ligands (Fig.\u00a04c), prominently expressing primarily autocrine Wnt3 and Wnt6. CellChat also predicted that this dominant epithelial autocrine WNT signaling was supplemented by a minor DC-derived Wnt9a paracrine signaling (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b-d). In contrast with canonical WNT, the inferred ncWNT signaling network revealed that DC cells express only one ligand, Wnt5a, that drives paracrine DC-to-placode and autocrine DC-to-DC signaling (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05e).

Therefore, we further studied the cell\u2013cell communication among placodes, DC cells and melanocyte cells (including three melanocyte subpopulations: MELA-A, MELA-B, and MELA-C; see \u201cMethods\u201d section and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03g). CellChat revealed that melanocytes strongly respond to DC cells via previously unrecognized EDN signaling (Fig.\u00a04i). Edn3 is a ligand of the EDN pathway, which regulates melanocyte migration. Therefore, CellChat prediction suggests DC cells induce early directed migration of melanocytes. To experimentally examine this prediction, we used the RNAscope technique to spatially map expression of Dct, which marks late-stage melanocyte precursors, Edn3 ligand and its receptor Ednrb in E14.5 embryonic mouse skin. As expected, Dct+ melanocytes (i.e., MELA-C subpopulation) localize in and around epithelial placode. They also express Ednrb. In turn, Edn3 is specifically enriched in DC cells (preDC, DC1, and DC2 subpopulations), while Ednrb is also enriched in a portion of DC cells (likely DC2 subpopulation). Scattered Ednrb+/Edn3neg/Dctneg cells inside dermal condensate are likely undifferentiated melanoblasts (i.e., MELA-A/B subpopulations) (Fig.\u00a04j). This spatial Edn3, Ednrb, Dct co-expression pattern is highly consistent with the scRNA-seq data (Fig.\u00a04i). Thus, our RNAscope result confirms the CellChat prediction of Edn3-Ednrb signaling from DC cells to melanocytes, implying the roles for DC cells in inducing early-stage directed migration of melanocytes into placodes.

By comparing the overall communication probability between nonlesional and lesional skin, we found that 11 out of 16 signaling pathways were highly active in lesional skin, including 9 pathways involved in inflammatory and immune response, such as CXCL, LIGHT, GLAECTIN, COMPLEMENT, MIF, CSF, IL4, CCL, and TNF (Fig.\u00a07c). Four pathways were specifically active in lesional skin, including known inflammatory signals CSF, IL4, CCL, and TNF, suggesting that these pathways might critically contribute to disease progression. Specific to CCL signaling, CellChat identified ligand-receptor pair CCL19-CCR7 as the most significant signaling, contributing to the communication from Inflam.FIB to Inflam.DC (Fig.\u00a07d\u2013f). This is in agreement with a reported experimental finding. Ligand MIF and its multi-subunit receptor CD74/CD44 were found to act as major signaling from Inflam.FIB to Inflam.TC in lesional skin compared to nonlesional skin (Fig.\u00a07d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a09a\u2013c).
