Consequently, there are still few studies on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)-related cuproptosis, and we aimed to deepen in this matter. In this study, data from 503 patients with lung cancer from the TCGA-LUAD cohort data collection and 11 LUAD single-cells from GSE131907 as well as from 10 genes associated with cuproptosis were analyzed. The AUCell R package was used to determine the copper-dependent cell death pathway activity for each cell subpopulation, calculate the CellChat score, and display cell communication for each cell subpopulation. The PROGENy score was calculated to show the scores of tumor-related pathways in different cell populations. GO and KEGG analyses were used to calculate pathway activity. Univariate COX and random forest analyses were used to screen prognosis-associated genes and construct models. The ssGSEA and xCell algorithms were used to calculate the immunocyte infiltration score. Based on data from the GDSC database, the drug sensitivity score was calculated using oncoPredict. Finally, in vitro experiments were performed to determine the role of TLE1, the most important gene in the prognostic model. The 11 LUAD single-cell samples were classified into 8 different cell populations, from which epithelial cells showed the highest copper-dependent cell death pathway activity. Epithelial cell subsets were significantly positively correlated with MAKP, hypoxia, and other pathways. In addition, cell subgroup communication showed highly active collagen and APP pathways. Using the Findmark algorithm, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between epithelial and other cell types were identified. Combined with the bulk data in the TCGA-LUAD database, DEGs were enriched in pathways such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, Hippo signaling pathway, and tight junction. Subsequently, we selected 4 genes (out of 112) with prognostic significance, ANKRD29, RHOV, TLE1, and NPAS2, and used them to construct a prognostic model. The high- and low-risk groups, distinguished by the median risk score, showed significantly different prognoses. Finally, we chose TLE1 as a biomarker based on the relative importance score in the prognostic model.

It has the highest morbidity and mortality rates worldwide and poses a serious threat to human health. Treatment options for lung cancer encompass chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. However, the insidious nature of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) makes early diagnosis challenging. Consequently, most patients are diagnosed in the advanced stages. This late diagnosis significantly restricts the applicability of surgical interventions and exacerbates health complications due to the metastatic spread of cancer cells. To improve the outcome of LUAD, reasonable treatments should be implemented. Currently, tumor risk score prediction signatures are used to determine the survival rate of patients. Therefore, patient prognosis can be accurately predicted by these tools, which are gradually being used in clinical settings. As a result, prognostic features should be urgently identified to predict the long-term survival rates of patients with LUAD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3654, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cell death is a common part of life; thus, it has always been a focus on life science research.

For example, all life relies on copper, which is typically found at very low levels in mammalian cells, similar to iron ions. Increasing the concentration of copper ions in cells above the threshold required for homeostasis can also cause cytotoxicity. Tsvetkov et al. discovered a novel mode of cell death that depends on and is regulated by copper ions; it is called copper-induced cell death or cuproptosis. The mechanism of cuproptosis involves direct binding of copper ions to acylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, leading to abnormal aggregation of acylated proteins and loss of iron-sulfur cluster proteins, ultimately leading to proteotoxic stress-mediated cell death. Despite the advances in understanding cuproptosis, its specific role in LUAD remains unclear. There is a gap in knowledge concerning how cuproptosis interacts with other cellular processes and pathways within the context of LUAD, and how these interactions could potentially impact disease progression and patient prognosis. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the involvement of cuproptosis in LUAD, to elucidate its regulatory role, and to explore its potential as a novel therapeutic target for LUAD treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5604, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The advantage of using bioinformatics methods in this study lies in their ability to handle large-scale and heterogeneous data, thereby enhancing the depth and breadth of our analysis. By integrating gene expression profiles and single-cell data from multiple LUAD samples, we could comprehensively elucidate the complex landscape of cuproptosis in LUAD, providing a resolution unachievable with conventional experimental methods. In this study, we identified seven genes associated with cuproptosis (FDX1, LIAS, LIPT1, DLD, DLAT, PDHA1, and PDHB) and three genes that inhibit it (MTF1, GLS, and CDKN2A). Though it was previously thought that a model of cuproptosis could be constructed based solely on gene expression levels, our application of bioinformatics has revealed that the related subtypes of cuproptosis cannot be fully uncovered using such a method. By calculating the copper-dependent death pathway score and screening for copper-induced death subsets, we were able to identify two types of cuproptosis expression patterns, each associated with different prognoses and tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics.

The AUCell R package was used to determine the activity of the cuproptosis pathway for each cell subset, based on the expression profiles of ten commonly upregulated genes. The AUCell algorithm is an innovative computational method used in the realm of single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis. Its primary goal is to score individual cells based on a predefined set of genes, with an emphasis on gene expression rankings rather than absolute expression levels. This algorithm effectively transforms gene expression matrices into an enrichment score for each cell, essentially providing a measure of the activity of a certain gene set within each individual cell. The methodology behind AUCell involves the calculation of an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each gene set and cell, thereby creating a robust ranking system that can accommodate various gene expression distributions. This method is highly beneficial for analyzing single-cell data as it allows the identification of cell subsets expressing a specific gene signature, even when the signature is only mildly expressed.

Patients with LUAD have a poor prognosis. In the current state of lung cancer screening, low-dose computed tomography screening can reduce mortality, but it is associated with a high false-positive rate. To prevent and control LUAD, it is crucial to determine reliable lung cancer risk characteristics and accurately predict the prognosis and survival of the patients. Recent discoveries have led to the discovery of a new form of cell death called cuproptosis. This copper-dependent cell death is caused by the direct binding of copper to acylated lipid components of the TCA cycle in mitochondrial respiration, leading to aggregation of acylated proteins, followed by reduction of iron-sulfur proteins, proteotoxicity, and, ultimately, cell death. In an attempt to induce cuproptosis, the small molecule anticancer drug elesclomol, which is a copper ionophore, has undergone clinical trials, but the results have not been satisfactory. Consequently, further research on cuproptosis and its regulatory role in LUAD is needed. Here, we comprehensively described the clinical significance of cuproptosis patterns in LUAD as well as their relationship with TME features. Furthermore, a cuproptosis scoring system was proposed to help doctors develop more effective immunotherapy strategies by improving the understanding of the TME.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28591, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our investigation, we analyzed data from 503 patients with lung cancer (the TCGA-LUAD cohort) and 11 LUAD single-cell datasets from GSE131907. Based on cell characteristic markers, the cells were divided into eight cell subsets. The activity of the cuproptosis pathway was higher in the epithelial cell subsets, and carcinogenic pathways such as MAPK and TGF-\u03b2 were enriched in this cell subset, revealing that tumors may originate from epithelial cells and that cuproptosis plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Subsequent cell communication analyses revealed that CD74 is an active element in the interaction between epithelial cell subsets and other cells. Fernandez-Cuesta et al. analyzed LUAD tissues from 25 non-smokers and identified a new somatic gene fusion, CD74-NRG1, that causes the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-\u03b23 to be expressed extracellularly, thereby, providing ligands for the ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complex. Xu et al. also proposed that CD74 is involved in the development of various types of cancer and demonstrated that CD74 can be used as a biomarker for predicting prognosis in patients with glioma. These results suggest that CD74 is an important factor involved in the interaction between epithelial cells and other cells.

Using transcriptome sequencing, the risk score of patients with LUAD can be determined from pathological samples.
