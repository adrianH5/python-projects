Therefore, it has important implications to investigate the molecular mechanism governing hair follicle development. Due to high cellular heterogeneity as well as the insufficient cellular, molecular, and spatial characterization of hair follicles on sheep, the molecular mechanisms involved in hair follicle development and wool curvature of sheep remains largely unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have made it possible to comprehensively dissect the cellular composition of complex skin tissues and unveil the differentiation and spatial signatures of epidermal and hair follicle development. However, such studies are lacking so far in sheep. Here, single-cell suspensions from the curly wool and straight wool lambskins were prepared for unbiased scRNA-seq. Based on UAMP dimension reduction analysis, we identified 19 distinct cell populations from 15,830 single-cell transcriptomes and characterized their cellular identity according to specific gene expression profiles. Furthermore, novel marker gene was applied in identifying dermal papilla cells isolated in vitro. By using pseudotime ordering analysis, we constructed the matrix cell lineage differentiation trajectory and revealed the dynamic gene expression profiles of matrix progenitors' commitment to the hair shaft and inner root sheath (IRS) cells. Meanwhile, intercellular communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells was inferred based on CellChat and the prior knowledge of ligand\u2013receptor pairs. As a result, strong intercellular communication and associated signaling pathways were revealed. Besides, to clarify the molecular mechanism of wool curvature, differentially expressed genes in specific cells between straight wool and curly wool were identified and analyzed. Our findings here provided an unbiased and systematic view of the molecular anatomy of sheep hair follicle comprising 19 clusters; revealed the differentiation, spatial signatures, and intercellular communication underlying sheep hair follicle development; and at the same time revealed the potential molecular mechanism of wool curvature, which will give important new insights into the biology of the sheep hair follicle and has implications for sheep breeding.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2453, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2466, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Wool is the critical textile raw material which is produced by the hair follicle of sheep.

Hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) and dermal papilla cell (DPC) play a crucial role in hair follicle cycles, which was demonstrated by hair regeneration assay in vitro using the above cells. The research of hair follicles progressed rapidly since the molecular markers of HFSC and DPC had been identified, such as keratin 15 (K15), CD34 in mice, and CD200 in humans for HFSC as well as SOX2 for DPC, which allowed isolation and characterization of these cells from follicles using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Besides, recent studies showed that immune cells, adipose cells, etc. in the skin play critical roles in regulating hair follicle development. However, due to the lack of bulge structure and few available antibodies for sheep, the marker genes of HFSC and DPC as well as other cells of the hair follicle in sheep are still elusive.

Thibaut revealed that hair curliness was programmed from the bulb and was associated with asymmetry in differentiation programs.

Hu sheep, our research object, is famous for lambskin and high reproductive traits.

Since the hair follicle is constantly renewed, once activated, HFSCs typically give rise to matrix progenitors, which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. To investigate the gene regulatory machinery underlying the matrix progenitors' commitment to the hair shaft (HS), IRS, and the companion layer, the related hair follicle epidermal cell clusters (clusters 1, 2, 7, 8, and 10) were selected to infer the cell lineage developmental trajectory using a monocle. As expected, pseudotime trajectory construction analysis displayed two branches (Figure 4A). To infer each branch's identity, DEG analysis was performed between the branches (Supplementary Table S2). As a result, IRS marker genes including KRT71, KRT25, KRT27, and GATA3 were enriched in cell fate 1; HS marker genes including KRT36, KRT84, and KRT2.11 were enriched in cell fate 2, which indicated the successful recapitulation of the HS and IRS differentiation trajectory from the matrix progenitors. Besides, monocle trajectory gene expression analysis revealed HS differentiation-related genes such as FOXN1, HOXC13, MSX1/2, and WNT3; IRS-differentiation-related genes such as GATA3 and unexpected SOX9; and matrix cells' enriched genes such as CCND1, CCND2, and PCNA (Supplementary Figure S3). It was of interest that SFRP1, the WNT antagonist, was upregulated during IRS specification, while WNT3 and LEF1, the ligand and nuclear mediator of WNT signaling, were upregulated during HS differentiation, which indicated the opposite effect of WNT signaling in matrix progenitors' commitment to the HS and IRS (Figure 4B). To further unmask the molecular mechanism underlying HS and IRS specification, we compartmentalized the identified branch-specific DEGs using k-means clustering (Figure 4C). As expected, gene sets 2, 3, and 4 corresponded with HS, matrix, and IRS, while gene set 1 was speculated relating with the pre-cortex, the precursor cell of HS cortex, since the enriched genes MSX2, HOXC13, and DLX3 had been demonstrated as key transcription factors in promoting pre-cortex differentiation. To investigate gene functions in each gene cluster, Metascape was used to perform GO analysis.

To verify whether the different curvature of the wool was related to distinct molecular pathways in the DPCs, the gene expression profiles of DPCs between straight wool individuals and curly wool were initially compared through Seurat. As a result, 74 DEGs were found (Figure 6A) (Supplementary Table S4). Among these genes, SPINK5, RPTN, CRABP1, SFN, and SFRP1 had been previously demonstrated to play an important role in hair follicle development. We were particularly intrigued by the RPTN gene and CRABP1, as variation in the RPTN gene may facilitate straight hair formation in Europeans and East Asians, and CRABP1 is specifically expressed in the hair follicle DP in normal postnatal skin and may influence regulators of hair bending in mice as retinoic acid-binding proteins. Meanwhile, a series of collagen genes, including COL4A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL6A3, and COL4A1, were found in the DEGs. Collagen, coded by collagen genes, are extracellular matrix molecules that regulate DPCs behavior and hair development. In addition, through comparing the DEGs with DP signature genes, we found that 19 DP signature genes were differentially expressed between straight wool and curly wool, including S100A4, CRABP1, SFRP1, DCN, and collagen genes (Supplementary Table S4). To further gain insight into the signature and biological process underlying wool curvature, we used Metascape to perform GO analysis.

Furthermore, the DEGs in matrix cell, IRS, and HFSC were also analyzed (Supplementary Tables S5\u2013S9), since these cells may also affect the hair shape. It is worth noting that KRT71, the major structural component of the hair follicle IRS layer, was differentially expressed in the IRS cells between straight wool and curly wool.

Meanwhile, the hair follicle is the ideal model for studying systems biology as it undergoes life-long cyclical transformations. Originally, through natural and induced mutant mice as well as the transgenic mice model, a number of genes related with hair follicle development had been identified. Through lineage tracing, microanatomy, and micromechanical separation, the critical cells, DP and HFSC, had been isolated, studied, and characterized in vitro. Recently, Rezza et al. used FACS and RNA sequencing to define gene expression signatures of distinct hair follicle cell types from embryonic skin. Rendl et al. examined transcriptional profiles of DPCs and the cells surrounding their niche through employing double-transgenic mice and selective cell-surface labeling. However, most of the studies relied on bulk-sampling techniques and cell enrichment using pre-defined markers; the dynamics of genes expression during development and molecular relationship between the different cell populations were still insufficiently addressed. In contrast, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies have made it possible to comprehensively dissect the cellular composition of complex skin tissues, unveil novel cell populations, and reveal the differentiation and spatial signatures of skin and hair follicle development. However, such studies are lacking so far in sheep; some fundamental questions such as the marker genes of DPC and HFSC, the interaction between epidermis and dermis, and the molecular mechanism of wool curvature on sheep are still unknown.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33904, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here, we used scRNA-seq to sequence 15,830 cells from the lamb skin including straight wool and curly wool skins; 19 clusters were identified, and 14 cell types including all known cell types in hair follicle were subsequently characterized, which showed the cellular heterogeneity of skin cells during tissue homeostasis. Based on Seurat analysis and well-defined markers, we identified the potential marker genes of all the cell types. Among these marker genes, some of these were conserved among different species, such as the keratin markers in different keratinocyte cells, while some marker genes showed specificity in sheep. Sox2 and CD34 were well-recognized marker genes for DPC and HFSC in mice and humans, however, we did not detect them in our sequencing data. Besides, through Seurat analysis, we identified two HFSC cell types. Corresponding with that, HFSCs presented quiescent state and proliferate state early in the anagen. Recently, Morita traced the origin of HFSC using marker-independent long-term 3D live imaging and scRNA-seq, and upper HFSCs and lower HFSCs with different transcriptome were found. In addition, our study provided novel marker genes for the different skin cell types in sheep, yet these marker genes should be further verified. Using immunofluorescence of skin tissue sections, several marker genes were verified, which were consistent with scRNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, we successfully applied marker genes identified from our data on DPCs isolated in vitro. It is worth noting that IGFBP3, a novel marker gene identified from our data, showed a close relationship with the aggregative growth character of DPCs. In line with that, IGFBP3 was mainly expressed in the human DP. Previous studies have reported that IGF1 and IGF1 signaling as an important mitogenic and morphogenetic regulator was essential for normal hair growth and development. Since IGF1 was expressed in the DP from our data and the IGFBP3 have high affinity for IGFs, we speculated that IGFBP3 played a significant role in DPC aggregative growth through IGF signaling.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35988, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on the above analysis, we identified 19 populations of skin cells and unmasked their gene expression profiles.

Therefore, according to their transcriptional profile, we reconstructed the differentiation processes by ordering hair follicle epidermal cell lineage cells along a path using a network-based approach (Trapnell et al., 2014). We revealed that IRS and HS cells were at the end of branches, while the companion layer was at the front. Correspondingly, Mesler et al. report that matrix can be divided into early and late phases; early matrix progenitors form the hair follicle companion layer, whereas later matrix populations progressively form the IRS and HS. Meanwhile, we revealed matrix commitment to the HS and IRS based on distinct temporal, molecular, and functional characteristics. Different transcription factors may govern IRS and HS specification. Signals from the dermal cell were required during epidermal cell lineage commitment; however, it remains unclear how epidermal\u2013dermal cell interactions drive specific cell fate decisions. Therefore, we analyzed intercellular communication networks using CellChat and the public ligand\u2013receptor database. We revealed that DP cells may interact with the epidermal cell through FGF, IGF, and PDGF signaling, while matrix cells regulated HS cells and IRS cells through WNT signaling. Correspondingly, growth factors and cytokines such as IGF1 and FGF7 secreted from DP regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hair follicle keratinocytes surrounding DP.

Previously, Demars revealed the mutation underlying fleece variation through comparing ancestral hairy sheep with a long and hairy fleece and modern woolly sheep with a short and woolly fleece in genome-wide scale. However, the detailed regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Driskell demonstrated that Sox2-positive DPCs specify particular hair follicle type in mice, which indicated that the gene expression profiles may affect hair curvature. Due to the selection of lambskin traits, segregation of wool curvature character appeared in the Hu sheep population including curly wool and straight wool individuals, which provide an excellent research material to study the biology of wool curvature. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism underlying wool curvature using curly and straight wool Hu sheep at single cell transcriptome. Different from mice, our study had not detected the specific expression of SOX2 in DPCs. We found 74 DEGs in DPC between straight wool and curly wool, including WNT signaling gene and a series of hair follicle development-related genes. Among these DEGs, Spink5-deficient mice displayed impaired keratinization, hair malformation, and a skin barrier caused by abnormal desmosome cleavage. RPTN, encoding repetin, could interact with trichohyalin and connect to keratin intermediate filaments, which may facilitate straight hair formation in Europeans and East Asians due to variation in the RPTN gene. SFN is a cell cycle regulator involved in the program of epithelial keratinization. Mice heterozygous for the SFN mutation had severe defects in HS differentiation. DCN is expressed in the extracellular matrix of DPCs, where it may play a positive role in hair biology. SFRP1, the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling antagonist, is expressed in DPCs, which was related to the capability of inducing hair follicles. Previous studies showed that WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling maintained the hair-inducing capacity of the DPCs, was involved in hair follicle differentiation through regulating keratin genes, and was evidently critical for hair curvature. In accordance with that, we found that KRT71 was differentially expressed in the IRS cells between straight wool and curly wool groups. Current evidence suggests that KRT71 was involved in the determination of natural variation in hair morphology. Based on the above results and the consensus that DPC is the regulatory center of hair follicles, we speculated that different activity of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway in the DPCs may affect the keratin organization in the IRS and further affect the wool curvature. Besides, GO analysis was performed on these DEGs. Except for GO terms of \u201chair follicle development\u201d and \u201csupramolecular fiber organization,\u201d it is worth noting that the DEGs enriched GO terms of \u201cnegative regulation of cell population proliferation.\u201d As previous study had demonstrated that the number of DPC specified hair size, shape, and cycling, we assumed that there is a difference in the number of DPCs between curly wool and straight wool individuals. According to the above analysis, we believe that the DPCs may play a critical role in regulating wool curvature. However, more research is needed for a deeper understanding of wool curvature.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41092, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41103, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, our findings provided an unbiased and systematic view of molecular anatomy of the sheep hair follicle comprising 19 clusters, revealed the differentiation, spatial signatures and intercellular communication underlying sheep hair follicle development, and at the same time revealed the potential molecular mechanism of wool curvature, which will give important new insights into the biology of the sheep hair follicle and its associated breeding.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41565, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Data Availability Statement", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41593, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The single-cell RNA sequencing data used in this research are deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number: GSE186204.
