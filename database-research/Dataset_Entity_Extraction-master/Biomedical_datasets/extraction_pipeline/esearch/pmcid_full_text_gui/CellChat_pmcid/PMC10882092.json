LUAD microenvironment has been categorized into three phenotypes, namely, \u201cinflamed\u201d, \u201cimmune-desert\u201d, and \u201cimmune-excluded\u201d, which mediate different prognoses and immunotherapeutic responses. The inflamed phenotype demonstrates anti-cancer immune activation and has a better prognosis. However, angiogenic Cluster1 in this study was associated with a poor prognosis, demonstrating the characteristics of the immune-deserted and immune-excluded phenotypes, which are characterized by differential activation of oncogenic signaling pathways such as glycolysis, cell cycle, hypoxia, and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. Moreover, immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune-related regulatory factors were downregulated in Cluster1.

Furthermore, angiogenesis activated the three cell states with specific transcription factors (regulons). Evaluation of RAS revealed differences in transcription factors regulating the heterogeneity of angiogenic activation in malignant LUAD cells. Transcription factors of State2 cells were found to be associated with angiogenic activation. However, transcription factors of State3 cells mediated lower angiogenic activation, and angiogenic activation was more complex in State 1 cells than in State2 and State3 cells.

In this study, different cell states, that is, different activation states of angiogenic pathways, communicated significantly differently with cells in the TME of LUAD, which further reveals the role of angiogenesis in the crosstalk in TME. Furthermore, multiple ligand\u2013receptor pairs associated with malignant, immune, and stromal cells were identified, some of which have been reported to play a significant role in lung cancer. For example, the TNFRSF12A/Fn14 signaling axis activates NF-\u03baB to promote the survival of LUAD cells, and IGF2 promotes neovascularisation in LUAD. However, SEMA3B attenuates tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Furthermore, a complex relationship was observed between State1 and angiogenesis, and several novel cellular communication modes of State1 cells were identified. State1 cells were found to communicate closely with fibroblasts and M2-type macrophages via the POSTIN\u2013(ITGAV+ITGB5) and MDK\u2013(ITGA6+ITGB1) signaling pathways, respectively; however, State2 cells promoted tumorigenesis by interacting with microenvironmental cells through a different communication mode, such as the HBEGF\u2013EGFR pathway that induces the proliferation and growth of lung cancer cells.

However, anti-angiogenic therapy has been shown to improve the response to immunotherapy while preventing tumor immune escape. Given the significant role of angiogenesis in the prognosis of LUAD and TME, an individualized prognostic model (ARS) based on angiogenesis-related genes was constructed in this study for assessing the TME and survival of patients with LUAD. ARS can be considered an independent prognostic factor for LUAD and can guide individualized treatment strategies. It was significantly correlated with immune-related pathways, cell cycle, and drug metabolism and was significantly positively correlated with the infiltration of Th2 cells and neutrophils. Th2 cells can form an immunosuppressive microenvironment and promote tumor immune escape. However, ARS had a significant negative correlation with the infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells such as CD8+ T cells, with the high and low ARSs characterizing the immunosuppressive and anti-tumor immune microenvironments, respectively. Significant differences were observed in mutation frequencies between the high- and low-ARS groups. TP53 mutations significantly increased the expression of immune checkpoints and were associated with the significant clinical benefits of PD-1 inhibitors. KEAP1-driven co-mutations in LUAD are closely associated with having high TMB but not responding to immunotherapy. In this study, significant differences in mutation frequencies between the high- and low-ARS groups and their close correlation with immunotherapy response indicated that ARS can help to individually assess the immune infiltration status, immunotherapeutic response, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in patients with LUAD.
