Adaptive responses to RAF/MEK inhibition occur on a timescale of hours to days, involve homeostatic responses that reactivate MAP kinase signaling and compensatory mitogenic pathways, and attenuate the anti-tumor effects of RAF/MEK inhibitors. We profile adaptive responses across a panel of melanoma cell lines using multiplex biochemical measurement, single-cell assays, and statistical modeling and show that adaptation involves at least six signaling cascades that act to reduce drug potency (IC50) and maximal effect (i.e., Emax\u00a0\u226a\u00a01). Among these cascades, we identify a role for JNK/c-Jun signaling in vemurafenib adaptation and show that RAF and JNK inhibitors synergize in cell killing. This arises because JNK inhibition prevents a subset of cells in a cycling population from becoming quiescent upon vemurafenib treatment, thereby reducing drug Emax.

We apply a three-step approach involving measurement of multiple signaling proteins across dose and time combined with population average and single-cell measurement of cell state and phenotype followed by statistical modeling.

Significant but quantitatively modest increases in apoptosis were also observed upon co-treatment of cells with vemurafenib and SP600125, a structurally distinct but less selective JNK inhibitor (Supplementary Fig S2L).

In population-level measures of signaling proteins (e.g., RPPA or Western blots of pERK levels), incomplete response gives rise to partial inhibition of a signaling pathway, but at a single-cell level it usually involves cell-to-cell variability. This is particularly true in the case of apoptosis, which is an all-or-none change in cell fate (Flusberg et\u00a0al,). Our data show that Emax\u00a0<\u00a01 for viability following exposure of even the most sensitive BRAFV600E cells to RAF/MEK inhibitors, implying high cell-to-cell variability.

Apoptosis was measured using the DEVD-NucView488/Hoechst 33342 assay described above. To monitor the effect of vemurafenib at the level of signaling, we measured S6 phosphorylation (Ser235/236). pS6 is a marker of TORC1 activity (Magnuson et\u00a0al,; Corcoran et\u00a0al,), a multiprotein complex controlled by signaling cascades such as MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and LKB1/AMPK (Roux et\u00a0al,; Shaw et\u00a0al,; Magnuson et\u00a0al,) involved in adaptation to vemurafenib (a point we return to below). pS6 levels have previously been proposed as a particularly effective predictor of resistance of melanoma cells to vemurafenib-induced apoptosis (Corcoran et\u00a0al,), and we found pS6(Ser235/236) levels 24\u201348\u00a0h after drug treatment to be the best single predictor of apoptosis across cell lines, drugs, and doses. We asked whether JNK/c-Jun-mediated resistance to apoptosis was correlated with pS6 levels.

The proportion of Ki-67Low/p-cJunHigh cells increased concomitantly (visible as broadening of the distribution of cells along the horizontal axis of Fig5A, bottom left panel). Similar data were obtained with pRb: untreated WM1552C cells comprised \u223d54% cycling pRbHigh and \u223d46% interphase pRblow cells (Fig5A, top right panel; Supplementary Fig S3B). Exposure to vemurafenib reduced the proportion of pRbHigh/p-cJunHigh cells fourfold at 0.8\u00a0\u03bcM (from \u223d35% to \u223d9%) and increased the proportion of pRbLow/p-cJunHigh cells twofold (from \u223d25% to \u223d48%) (Fig5A). This shift was observed within \u223d24\u00a0h of drug exposure in all four lines (Fig5B) at a time when cell killing was negligible. It thus reflects a change in the distribution of the population from proliferation to quiescence rather than death of a subset of cells. Among the four cell lines that exhibited synergistic apoptotic responses to RAF and JNK inhibitors in combination, two (WM115 and COLO858) had low basal p-cJunHigh fractions (i.e., \u223d15% and \u223d3% p-cJunHigh, respectively), and vemurafenib increased the p-cJunHigh fraction to \u223d40%, a 3- to 12-fold increase, representing a clear case of JNK/c-Jun activation. In the other two lines (WM1552C and LOXIMVI), 50\u201360% of cells were already in a p-cJunHigh state under normal conditions, and they retained this following exposure to vemurafenib. In all four lines, regardless of the basal p-cJun levels, vemurafenib exposure resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of quiescent p-cJunHigh state (Fig5B). This contrasts with C32, MMACSF, and MZ7MEL cells in which p-cJun levels (and also the p-cJunHigh/pRbLow subpopulation) were reduced following vemurafenib treatment (Supplementary Fig S3C).

Thus, only a small fraction of the difference in cell killing by structurally distinct MEK and RAF inhibitors is explained by differences in the extent of target inhibition (pERK levels at 1\u00a0h) independent of pS6 changes. For example, the fact that SB590885 was no more effective than PLX4720 in killing melanoma cells despite more efficient pERK inhibition can be explained by insignificant differences in pS6 inhibition (Fig6H). Conversely, more efficient killing of C32 cells relative to WM1552C cells by PLX4720 (despite equivalent reductions in pERK) can be explained by significantly more effective suppression of pS6 (Fig6I). It has been proposed that pS6 levels better predict the responsiveness of melanoma patients to RAF inhibition than pERK levels (Corcoran et\u00a0al,), and our data are in agreement with this finding. Our data also suggest that pS6 is effective as a biomarker because it reports on the activities of pathways such as JNK/c-Jun involved in adaptive drug response.

We find that cellular responses to RAF or MEK inhibition are remarkably diverse across cell lines\u2014even those carrying the same BRAFV600E driver\u2014and involve multiple cell signaling kinases that can be up- or down-regulated over time, often in different directions in different cell lines.

The plasticity of adaptive signaling, the different ways in which signaling kinases are coupled to cell state and phenotype, and the fact that we did not observe strong positive and negative correlations between different pathways raise the question of whether every cell line (or patient tumor) adapts differently to the anti-mitogenic effects of MEK or BRAFV600E inhibition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44128, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also find that the JNK/c-Jun pathway, a primary mediator of cytokine and stress responses, is important in adaptive responses to vemurafenib. c-Jun is up-regulated in a subset of melanoma lines and co-treating cells with RAF and JNK kinase inhibitors results in a synergistic induction of apoptosis, an observation of potential therapeutic significance. The primary effect of JNK inhibition is to prevent a vemurafenib-induced shift from cycling to quiescence with a concomitant reduction in the level of apoptosis. We propose that drug-induced changes in cell cycle distribution increase cell-to-cell variability and help explain why Emax is relatively low for many MEK/RAF inhibitors even in cell lines scored as sensitive based on IC50.

Because many samples can be assayed inexpensively in parallel, RPPA represents a good match to our experimental systems. RPPA is limited, however, to assaying proteins for which good antibodies exist and the signal-noise level is relatively poor. Future improvements to the approach include the use of alternative multiplexing methods including mass spectrometry to perform a deeper analysis of signaling under selected conditions (Fedorenko et\u00a0al,).

Another use of PLSR and related modeling methods is to evaluate potential biomarkers. pS6 has been proposed as a clinical biomarker for assessing the effectiveness of targeted therapy in BRAFV600E tumors (Corcoran et\u00a0al,), and our data add the insight that c-Jun up-regulation can also be estimated by measuring pS6 levels. pS6 levels are a significantly better measure of vemurafenib-induced apoptosis than pERK inhibition (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.62 versus 0.44), but neither is as good as a three-component PLSR model.

This is consistent with the view that adaptation is a fundamental property of a tumor cell that can be elicited by structurally distinct small molecules. However, to construct mechanistic models of these adaptive mechanisms, it will be necessary to expand the number of proteins measured and the number of perturbations introduced with siRNA or other drugs.

In some cases, inhibition of JNK signaling is clearly counter-indicated; in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the inhibition of JNK protects cells from UV-induced cell death (Vin et\u00a0al,). However, we find that the JNK/c-Jun pathway, hitherto little studied in melanoma (Lopez-Bergami et\u00a0al,), plays an important role in adaptive resistance to RAF and MEK kinase inhibitors in about half of cell lines tested. Exposing cells to vemurafenib and JNK inhibitors in combination results in synergistic cell killing. Single-cell analysis suggests that p-cJun up-regulation contributes to the resistance of a subset of the population to vemurafenib by decoupling the inhibition of proliferation from induction of apoptosis. c-Jun has well-recognized roles in regulating both proliferation and apoptosis (Wisdom et\u00a0al,), but in melanoma it is thought to function downstream of ERK by promoting transcription of cyclin D1, a positive regulator of the G1-S cell cycle transition (Lopez-Bergami et\u00a0al,). This link is evident in the first few hours after cells are exposed to RAF or MEK inhibitors when phospho-cJun levels fall dramatically. Subsequently, however, c-Jun phosphorylation is decoupled from ERK activity via processes that remain to be determined, but it is known that c-Jun activity can be elicited by growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, cAMP-dependent pathways, cellular stress, and cell cycle regulators such as Rb and cyclin-dependent kinases (de Groot & Sassone-Corsi,; Nead et\u00a0al,; Wisdom et\u00a0al,; Vanden Bush & Bishop,; Sun et\u00a0al,). It has also been reported that JNK activity promotes growth and survival of melanoma cells under unstressed conditions (Lopez-Bergami et\u00a0al,; Alexaki et\u00a0al,; Gurzov et\u00a0al,). Overall, our data suggest that pan-JNK inhibitors such as JNK-IN-8 are potentially useful in promoting vemurafenib-induced apoptosis in a subset of melanomas.

Our studies reveal that incomplete suppression at a population level is likely to represent a bimodal response in single-cells (Fig7).

In our study, the dimensions of the input data matrix for each cell line were 35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 (5 drugs\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07 doses; 21 signals\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05 time points). The initial dimensions for the cellular response measurements were 35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 (5 drugs\u00a0\u00d7 7 doses; viability and apoptotic fraction at three time points). We combined the two cellular response measurements (viability and apoptosis) at different time points to generate a new variable, \u201cnon-apoptotic viability\u201d, by subtracting the number of apoptotic cells from the total number of cells at each condition followed by normalization to a DMSO-treated control. We then averaged the 48 and 72\u00a0h non-apoptotic viability data to generate one output variable for each of the 35 conditions in the PLSR model. The reason for this averaging is that we observe a substantial variability in the timing of responses for different cell lines exposed to different drugs. For example, both C32 and MMACSF cell lines respond with high levels of apoptosis (60\u201380%) to 72-h treatment with PLX4720 at doses \u22651\u00a0\u03bcM, but C32 responds more quickly (with \u223d60% of apoptosis happening in the first 48\u00a0h) as compared with MMACSF (showing <20% apoptosis in the first 48\u00a0h) (see Supplementary Fig S1B). Thus, by averaging the cellular responses across the two time points, we account for the rate at which different cell lines respond to treatment (we did not use the 24\u00a0h cellular response data for PLSR modeling, as most of the cell lines do not begin to respond to treatments in the first 24\u00a0h). Accounting for averaging, the dimensions of the output data used in the PLSR models were 35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01. In the case of one cell line (K2), cellular response data at 72\u00a0h were unavailable and we used the 48\u00a0h data for PLSR modeling.

We computed and reported the percent of variance predicted using tenfold cross-validation. Model fitness was calculated using R2, Q2, and mean squared prediction error (MSPE) which were calculated as previously described (Gaudet et\u00a0al,). For the assessment of relative variable importance in each PLSR model, the information content of each variable (representing a signal measurement at a specific time point) was assessed by its variable importance in the projection (VIP) (Wold,; Janes et\u00a0al,):  where K is the total number of signaling variables (K\u00a0=\u00a021\u00a0\u00d75\u00a0=\u00a0105), wnk is the weight of the kth variable for the nth PLSR component, N is the total number of PLSR components, and SSn is the sum of squares explained by the nth PLSR component.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67089, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As described above, RPPA slides were scanned and analyzed twice using two different scanners and two different image analysis programs.
