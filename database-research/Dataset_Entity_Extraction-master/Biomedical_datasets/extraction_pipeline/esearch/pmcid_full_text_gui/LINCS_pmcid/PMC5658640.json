We were only able to obtain data corresponding to 3 months after the official PHR release, which is a relatively short period of time in the adoption curve. Consequently, these results might not be generalizable to the whole population of initial adopters.

Data regarding health problems was available for less than 9% (n=9543) of the total sample (N=109,619). Our definitions of users, nonusers, multiple inputs, and single input were conditioned by the particularities of this specific PHR and the data that we were able to collect. We included both dynamic (eg, blood pressure) and more static (eg, allergies) types of data to define PHR use and to characterize frequency of use. The use of these different types of data in the characterization of adopters should be further studied. Data regarding the booking of primary care consultations through the PHR or the access to summary care records were not available to researchers at the time of the study.
