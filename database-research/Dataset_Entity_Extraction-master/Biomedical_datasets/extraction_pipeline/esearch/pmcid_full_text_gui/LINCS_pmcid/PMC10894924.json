Recognized factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking have been identified as contributors to increased CVD risk, with atherosclerosis serving as its primary underlying pathology. Of these factors, hypertension emerges as a pervasive, modifiable risk element exacerbating atherosclerosis, particularly in the coronary and cerebral arteries. Despite the significance of these traditional risk factors, or composites thereof (like the Framingham score), their predictive value at the individual level remains limited. Seeking more precise indicators for future CVD events, numerous biomarker discovery studies have concentrated on plasma or serum molecules, yielding modest success. The CIRCULATING CELLS study was conceived to unveil and validate cell-based biomarkers for risk prognostication in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Among accessible cell types, blood monocytes, characterized by their ready trauma sensing capacity and adaptability, emerge as promising targets for biomarker discovery.

Both aging and male gender were shown to increase monocyte numbers and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Smoking was also shown to affect circulating monocyte numbers but to decrease their chemotactic capacity. Interestingly, monocytes from symptomatic CVD patients are primed in vivo to produce more pro-inflammatory cytokines after an ex vivo stimulation with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), linking infection to CVD. Undoubtedly, the pro-inflammatory signaling of monocytes/macrophages through toll-like receptors, such as toll-like-receptor-4 (TLR4), triggered by bacterial endotoxins like LPS, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Endotoxin levels may be elevated not only during infections but also in common subclinical or chronic conditions like periodontitis, sinusitis, or bronchitis. Interestingly, increased intestinal barrier disruption, often observed in patients and mouse models of CVD, is accompanied by a concurrent elevation in plasma endotoxin levels, inevitably contributing to systemic inflammation, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Collectively, this endorses the (patho)physiological relevance of our experimental setting and findings.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 45034, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A limitation of this study lies in the relatively modest number of participants and its exclusive focus on patients with clinically manifest CAD, presenting a complex constellation of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Due to the deliberate inclusion of only CAD patients in our cohort, the study design did not allow examination of the module\u2019s correlation with hypertension in a non-CAD context. Furthermore, we acknowledge that a significant proportion of CAD patients in our cohort had undergone anti-hypertensive treatment, often in conjunction with lipid-lowering or anticoagulant drugs. While we successfully ruled out a confounding role of drug treatment on the module\u2019s correlation with DBP for various medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers (both individually and collectively), the presence of medication may still complicate the data interpretation. The observed correlation in hypertensive patients undergoing anti-hypertensive treatment, however, suggests that the module exposes a common underlying disease mechanism that is either not targeted or inadequately addressed by the prescribed antihypertensive drugs themselves. Finally, monocyte LPS responsiveness was studied ex vivo. Although the isolation procedure was performed on ice, LPS stimulation was short (15 min), precluding early differentiation effects, and baseline monocytes did not show any indication of activation because of sample preparation and bead isolation, we cannot exclude that monocytes ex vivo behave different than in vivo.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 46661, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, our study demonstrated a strong negative association of diastolic blood pressure with LPS responses in monocytes of advanced, stable CAD patients, and identified a gene cluster sharply enriched in OXPHOS term members to mediate this correlation.
