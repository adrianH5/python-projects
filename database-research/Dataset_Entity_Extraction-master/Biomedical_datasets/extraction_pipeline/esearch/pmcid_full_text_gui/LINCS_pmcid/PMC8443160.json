Choosing appropriate transformations for variables can enhance visualization, improve efficacy of analytical methods, and increase data interpretability. However determining appropriate transformations of variables from high-content imaging data poses new challenges. Imaging data produces hundreds of covariates from each of thousands of images in a corpus. Each of these covariates will have a different distribution and need a potentially different transformation. As such imaging data produces hundreds of covariates, determining an appropriate transformation for each of them is infeasible by hand. In this paper we explore simple, robust, and automatic transformations of high-content image data. A central application of our work is to microenvironment microarray bio-imaging data from the NIH LINCS program. We show that our robust transformations enhance visualization and improve the discovery of substantively relevant latent effects. These transformations enhance analysis of image features individually and also improve data integration approaches when combining together multiple features. We anticipate that the advantages of this work will likely also be realized in the analysis of data from other high-content and highly-multiplexed technologies like Cell Painting or Cyclic Immunofluorescence.

Consider principal components analysis (PCA), one of the primary statistical techniques for visualization and recovery of latent variables. PCA is well-known to be sensitive to skewed distributions and outliers. Using PCA in such cases can lead to results that are unduly influenced by arbitrary data scales and often describe only a few particular outlying points. Thus an active area of research is methods for making PCA robust to such problems. One approach to dealing with data scale and outliers is data transformation. However, choosing the correct transformation is highly application specific and typically entails substantial domain-specific knowledge. While recommended transformations are established in some fields, determining an appropriate transformation is often itself a substantial question to answer. In this manuscript we tackle this problem by exploring automatic transformation and integration of features as part of a PCA data analysis pipeline. One important area in which automatic transformation of data is necessary is high-content imaging data. Such data consists of hundreds of features extracted from thousands of images using automatic feature detection software. While classically there is only one data matrix to transform, for high-content image data there will be hundreds of matrices to consider: one for each image feature. An appropriate transformation will need to be chosen for each of these feature matrices. In this paper we consider simple and robust ways of adaptively doing this. We show that transforming data can improve visualization and discovery of substantive latent effects in features individually and when integrating together multiple features. Consequently, we explore the interaction of transformation with integrating multiple features to extract a common set of latent variables. As part of all these analyses we employ methods to estimate principal components from data with missing values.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3595, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Motivating Application: MEMAs", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3625, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The motivating application of this work is data from the high-content bio-technology called the Microenvironment Microarray (MEMA).

Indeed, central to the Box-Cox estimator is a re-scaled sample variance. As the breakdown point of the sample variance is exactly zero, we expect the breakdown point of the Box-Cox estimator to also be near zero. A breakdown point near zero indicates that even one outlier can lead to a drastically over-fit Box-Cox transformation. To overcome this, the (G) step uses an interpretable and robust \u201cdivide-and-summarize\u201d approach to improve stability and avoid over-fitting. The procedure first divides the data column-wise and estimates a Gaussianizing (Box-Cox) transformation for each column of the feature matrix. To avoid over-fitting, the procedure then robustly summarizes the transformation parameters, choosing the median among the column-wise estimates. This median transformation is then used to transform the original feature matrix. This model-averaging approach is similar to attribute bagging seen in supervised learning applications. However because all attributes (columns) are used in (G), as opposed to a random subspace procedure, the estimates we calculate are interpretable.

For MEMAs, we divide latent effects into two categories: (1) biological effects and (2) technical effects. Biological effects include, for example, differences in biological endpoints due to ECMps or ligands. Technical effects are unwanted and we are interested in identifying them so that we may remove them. Examples include batch across plates or spatial effects within wells. Discovery of latent effects is typically done through visual inspection of plots or quantitative analysis like PCA. Unfortunately, methods like PCA are often misled by prominent aspects of the data are unrelated to substantive latent effects. As an example, consider how PCA can be misled when used to identify groups in skewed data. Let  have elements that are i.i.d from a standard log-normal distribution.
