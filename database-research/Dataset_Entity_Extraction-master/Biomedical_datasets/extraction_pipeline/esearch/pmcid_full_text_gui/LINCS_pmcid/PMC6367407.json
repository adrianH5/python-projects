Current modeling approaches consider prediction of a single metric of the drug response curve such as AUC or IC50. However, the single summary metric of a dose-response curve fails to provide the entire drug sensitivity profile which can be used to design the optimal dose for a patient. In this article, we assess the problem of predicting the complete dose-response curve based on genetic characterizations. We propose an enhancement to the popular ensemble-based Random Forests approach that can directly predict the entire functional profile of a dose-response curve rather than a single summary metric. We design functional regression trees with node costs modified based on dose/response region dependence methodologies and response distribution based approaches. Our results relative to large pharmacological databases such as CCLE and GDSC show a higher accuracy in predicting dose-response curves of the proposed functional framework in contrast to univariate or multivariate Random Forest predicting sensitivities at different dose levels. Furthermore, we also considered the problem of predicting functional responses from functional predictors i.e., estimating the dose-response curves with a model built on dose-dependent expression data. The superior performance of Functional Random Forest using functional data as compared to existing approaches have been shown using the HMS-LINCS dataset.

Yu et al. have presented each response curve as a linear combination of known basis functions and grown regression trees using the coefficients of this expansion, while Nerini et al. have proposed functional PCA in the classification method for easy representation of regression trees. The knowledge of the entire drug response curve can answer clinically relevant questions such as what will be the sensitivity at the highest non-toxic dose concentration (toxicity can be estimated using experimentations on normal cells or computational modeling) or the sensitivity at the drug concentration available at the targeted organ (pharmacokinetics estimated using micro-dosing) for that specific patient? Furthermore, a summary metric such as AUC for two different dose response curves might be same even when they might offer different information such as very high sensitivity for high doses for drug A as compared to relatively moderate sensitivity over all drug doses for drug B.

CCLE database was generated by Broad Institute and Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research. This database includes genetic and pharmacological characterization of 947 human cancer cell lines, together with pharmacological profiling of 24 small molecules (anticancer compounds) across ~500 of these cell lines that encompasses 36 tumor types. The response of a cell line to a specific drug is reported for 7 to 8 dose points ranging from 0.0025\u2009\u03bcM to 8\u2009\u03bcM. Additionally, four different drug sensitivity measures EC50, IC50, Amax and AUC are listed. Note that these measures are features of a dose-response curve fitted from the observed dose-response points. GDSC database was created as part of the Cancer Genome Project and contains gene expression data for 789 cell lines and drug responses for 714 cell lines. Each cell line has 22,277 probe sets for gene expression yielding a high dimensional feature space. Similar to CCLE, each cell line\u2019s response to the drugs are reported for 7 to 9 dose points where minimum dose ranges from 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125\u2009\u03bcM to 15.625\u2009\u03bcM and maximum dose ranges from 0.008\u2009\u03bcM to 4000\u2009\u03bcM. For our experiment, we utilize GDSC v5 that lists two drug sensitivity measures IC50 and AUC along with 105 different IC values for different levels of cell viability from 0.1% to 100% in each cell line for each drug. Note that these IC values are extracted from the complete dose-response curves fitted from the observed dose-response points and extrapolated to 100% cell viability as the curves do not reach 100% at maximum dose for most cell line\u2013drug pairs. Both CCLE and GDSC provide observed dose-response points or fitted curve points which could be utilized as our functional response data. However, the genomic characterization data are available in the stationary format as the expressions are measured before any drug application. Therefore, to demonstrate the functional input and output scenario for our FRF model, we have used data from the Harvard Medical School Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (HMS-LINCS) database, which to our knowledge, is the only publicly available source offering functional responses as well as predictors. HMS-LINCS offers genomic characterization data in the form of Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) expression data for 21 proteins where Phosphorylation state and protein levels were measured in 10 BRAFV600E/D melanoma cell lines at 7 different doses and 5 different time points. The cellular response data consists of viability and apoptosis measured in the same cell lines using Fluorescence imaging apoptosis assay for the same 7 doses but 3 different time points. The database contains data for 9 BRAFV600E and 1 BRAFV600D melanoma cell lines that were exposed to 4 RAF inhibitors and 1 MEK inhibitor at 7 different doses ranging from 3.2\u2009nM to 3.2\u2009\u03bcM.

We expect that a better model will have higher feature scores for the significant genes, and thus, in turn will result in a higher biological relevance. Typically in RF based models, VIM (or feature score) is calculated from either the frequency of feature selection, out of bag errors, or permutation measures.

Furthermore, FRF predicts the entire dose-response profile incorporating the continuous nature of the curve that separate RF models for individual doses fails to capture. We have illustrated this behavior for GDSC dataset by modeling 8 IC points using 8 different RFs to generate the dose-response profile which has an inferior performance compared to the continuous curve prediction from FRF (Table\u00a05). Moreover, a major advantage of predicting a complete curve is the visualization of the changes in response across different doses. Figure\u00a010 shows two representative cases of Curve(1) and Curve(2) that has same IC50 values and similar AUC values but their dose-response profiles are significantly different. For instance, a small dose increase above IC50 will produce significantly higher sensitivity for Curve(1) whereas Curve(2) will have minimal change for dose increases above the IC50 value.

For these drugs, the dose-response points at different doses for the available cell lines are stretched out and the resulting fitted curves or summary metrics show significant variations which cannot be captured by any Random Forest based model since it employs an smoothing strategy (averaging) in the leaf nodes to provide estimates around the mean prediction.
