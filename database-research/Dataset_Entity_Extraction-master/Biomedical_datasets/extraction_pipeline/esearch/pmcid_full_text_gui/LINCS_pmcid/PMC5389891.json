Through unique several intrinsic and extrinsic benchmarking schemes, we demonstrate that processing the L1000 data with the characteristic direction (CD) method significantly improves signal to noise compared with the MODZ method currently used to compute L1000 signatures. The CD processed L1000 signatures are served through a state-of-the-art web-based search engine application called L1000CDS2. The L1000CDS2 search engine provides prioritization of thousands of small-molecule signatures, and their pairwise combinations, predicted to either mimic or reverse an input gene expression signature using two methods. The L1000CDS2 search engine also predicts drug targets for all the small molecules profiled by the L1000 assay that we processed. Targets are predicted by computing the cosine similarity between the L1000 small-molecule signatures and a large collection of signatures extracted from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) for single-gene perturbations in mammalian cells. We applied L1000CDS2 to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to reverse expression in 670 disease signatures also extracted from GEO, and prioritized small molecules that can mimic expression of 22 endogenous ligand signatures profiled by the L1000 assay. As a case study, to further demonstrate the utility of L1000CDS2, we collected expression signatures from human cells infected with Ebola virus at 30, 60 and 120\u2009min. Querying these signatures with L1000CDS2 we identified kenpaullone, a GSK3B/CDK2 inhibitor that we show, in subsequent experiments, has a dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting Ebola infection in vitro without causing cellular toxicity in human cell lines. In summary, the L1000CDS2 tool can be applied in many biological and biomedical settings, while improving the extraction of knowledge from the LINCS L1000 resource.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2102, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2115, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Systematic collection and analysis of genome-wide gene expression drug\u2013response data from human cell lines can be used to identify drug repurposing opportunities, discover novel mechanisms of action for compounds, realize small-molecule mimickers of endogenous ligands, and assist in predicting side effects for pre-clinical compounds. Such an approach was initially made possible by the Connectivity Map, which contains the data on the transcriptional responses of four human cancer cells lines 6\u2009h after exposure to one of ~1,300 drugs and other small molecules. The Connectivity Map project has been extended under the auspices of the NIH library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) program by using a cost-effective genome-wide transcriptomics assay based on Luminex bead technology called L1000.

Currently, signatures from the LINCS-L1000 data are computed using the moderated Z-score (MODZ) method. Recently, we developed a multivariate method to compute signatures called the Characteristic Direction (CD). The CD method gives less weight to individual genes that display a large change in magnitude when comparing two conditions, for example, comparing gene expression from drug-treated cells with control cells. Some genes that change in magnitude substantially may be given a lower score, or a P value, compared with other methods such as the fold-change method. In fact, the fold-change method only considers the change in magnitude; and it is known to perform poorly. The CD method gives more weight to genes that move together in the same direction across repeats. So, a gene that changes less but \u2018moves\u2018 together with a large group of other genes may be scored higher than a gene that changed more in overall magnitude. The method first identifies the linear hyperplane that best separates the control samples from the treatment samples using linear discriminant analysis, and then uses the Normal to this hyperplane to define the direction of change in expression space for each gene. We have shown before that the CD method is more sensitive in identifying the \u2018correct\u2019 differentially expressed genes than most popular alternative methods using several benchmarking strategies applied to the real data.

We demonstrate that with the CD method we can significantly extract better signatures compared with the currently available computed signatures. All of the benchmarks presented in this current manuscript are different from the benchmarks presented before. These new benchmarks are specific for the L1000 data, and as such, they set the stage for other methods to be developed by showing how internal and external data can be used to evaluate computational pipelines for processing the L1000 data. To enable access and utility to the composite of the reprocessed CD signatures, we developed a state-of-the-art web-based application, which is a signature-search-engine called L1000CDS2. L1000CDS2 computes the angle between an input signature vector and the LINCS-L1000 data to prioritize small molecules and drugs to either reverse or mimic observed changes in gene expression. With the L1000CDS2 tool, we prioritized small molecules that can potentially reverse gene expression in 670 disease signatures extracted from gene expression omnibus (GEO), and predicted small molecules as potential mimickers of endogenous ligands. Using an independent collection of gene expression signatures of single-gene perturbations extracted from GEO we also predicted the most likely targets for each small molecule profiled by the L1000 assay. As a case study, we tested one prediction experimentally. Gene expression profiles from human dendritic cells soon after infection with Ebola virus (EBOV) were submitted as input to L1000CDS2. The top candidate from the L1000CDS2 signature search was kenpaullone, a non-specific inhibitor of kinases including GS3K\u03b2 and CDK2. Subsequent experiments on EBOV-infected HeLa and human foreskin fibroblast cells demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition by kenpaullone.

To test this hypothesis, we benchmarked L1000 signatures extracted with the CD method with the only currently implemented method called moderated Z-scores MODZ. First, we examined the overall distribution of CD signature P values and MODZ signature strengths (distil_ss) for a collection of 8,301 unique L1000 experiments from two batches (LJP5 and LJP6; Figure 1a,b). These histograms show a much fatter tail for the signatures extracted with the CD method, suggesting that this method identifies more potentially significant signatures. Indeed, there are 685 significant signatures that pass the distil_ss>6 cutoff, which is currently recommended to call significant MODZ signatures, compared with 2,045 significant signatures called by the CD method with a P<0.01. As there is a one-to-one correspondence between the signatures computed by the two methods, we computed the correlation between the two scoring schemes. We observed mild but significant correlation between the two signature-scoring methods (Figure 1c).

This correlation improves, and the difference in performance between the two methods widens, when filtering out all the non-significant perturbations (P value=1.1782e\u221214, t-test; Figure 1e). For the next benchmarking assessment we analyzed the data from the LJP4 batch where four classes of endogenous ligands: growth factors; cytokines; interferons and others, were systematically applied to six breast cancer cell lines. We asked which signature extraction method separates the signatures by perturbation type, time point and cell line. Using two unsupervised clustering methods: multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering, we plotted the signatures while coloring each signature by its known class membership: perturbation type, time point and cell line (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). These figures show that the clustering results computed with the CD better reflect known biological knowledge about the experimental conditions applied. The above benchmarking methods rely only on the L1000 data and some limited knowledge about the perturbation and this is why we call this set of benchmarks intrinsic. Additional benchmarking methods can be achieved with external data, termed extrinsic benchmarks.

For experiments of identical conditions, only the strongest as measured by CD signature P value were kept. To compute the similarity between gene expression signatures of these experiments, the cosine distance was used to for both CD and MODZ signatures. Euclidean distance was also used as another measure of similarity between MODZ signatures. The chemical structure of the 20,412 small molecules were encoded into the 166-bit Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) fingerprint, or the Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP4). Tanimoto score was used to quantify fingerprint similarity with Tanimoto coefficient of larger than 0.9 as a cutoff. Although there is some relationship between expression signatures computed with the MODZ method and the similarity of the chemical structure of the perturbagens, the CD method is able to recover more significant correlations between structure and expression (Figure 2a).

A recent study that utilized the original Connectivity Map data set showed how the protein interactions of known targets are commonly found in the differentially expressed genes induced by a drug treatment. CD signatures were compared with MODZ signatures for their ability to prioritize differentially expressed genes that are also direct protein interactors of the drug targets. The signatures of 756 small molecules in the LINCS L1000 data that have at least one known protein target were selected for this benchmarking strategy. Differentially expressed genes computed by each method, CD or MODZ, were sorted by their absolute differential expression value and compared with direct PPI of the targets using a random walk (Figure 2b). The aggregated walks for the CD signatures show a much sharper peak compared with the signatures computed with MODZ, suggesting that the CD detects more direct protein\u2013protein interactions of the known targets from the L1000 LINCS data. In summary, the intrinsic and extrinsic benchmarking analyses clearly demonstrate that the CD is potentially a better alternative for computing signatures compared with the MODZ method. However, this result is global. The CD method works better than the MODZ method across many data sets in general, but it is possible that the MODZ method consistently outperforms the CD under some specific conditions. In addition, caution should be placed when considering individual genes when using the CD method, for example, when picking genes for RT-PCR validation. This is because the CD method can score highly genes that will display changes that would not be considered statistically significant with univariate methods such as the student\u2019s t-test.

Dendritic cells from four human donors were infected with Ebola, and then genome-wide gene expression was measured prior to infection and at 30, 60 and 120\u2009min after infection. The differentially expression genes at each time point were computed comparing each time point to the control.

We found that the upregulated differentially expressed genes are enriched in immune response terms, and hypothesized that small molecules that mimic this gene expression state may enhance the intrinsic immune response to assist in attenuating Ebola infection. We queried these signatures with the L1000CDS2 tool to prioritize drugs and small molecules that can potentially mimic gene expression in Ebola-infected cells. Cosine distances were calculated for each L1000 direction with an Ebola signature direction from the three time points.

In these experiments kenpaullone was observed to consistently inhibit Ebola infection in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6b,c). It is important to note that while the compound potently inhibited viral infection, it did not affect overall cell number and was therefore non-cytotoxic. Since kenpaullone is a known GSK3B inhibitor, we next experimentally tested other well-established GSK3 inhibitors for efficacy of inhibiting Ebola infection in HeLa cells. These compounds were SB216763, SB415286, TCS2002 and TC-G 24. The cells were pretreated with the drug for 2\u2009h as before, and then infected with Ebola at the same MOI of five.

For example, abnormal innate immunity is by far the most enriched MGI mouse phenotype term for the upregulated genes upon Ebola infection after 60\u2009min (adjusted P value of <0.0001, Fisher\u2019s exact test); whereas the most enriched KEGG pathway is the N-glycan biosynthesis (adjusted P-value of <0.00001, Fisher\u2019s exact test). Next, we performed KEA on the downregulated genes after Ebola infection. KEA includes kinase\u2013substrate interactions extracted from publications and consolidated from six kinase\u2013substrate open online databases. In this gene-set library each term is a kinase and its substrates are the gene sets associated with each term. Interestingly, applying KEA to the downregulated genes at all three time points shows most enrichment for known GSK3B substrates, the known target of kenpaullone (Figure 7b). At the 30-min time point, substrates of CDK1 and CDK2 are also highly enriched together with GSK3B. These observation are consistent with our prediction of kenpaullone as the top mimicking drug. X2K analysis also confirms the potential involvement of GSK3B, CDK1 and CDK2 through the transcription factors beta-catenin, Smad3 and estrogen receptor 2 (Figure 7c). Smad3 activity was recently shown to be induced by kenpaullone to promote iTreg differentiation. X2K analysis first identifies the enriched transcription factors upstream of the differentially expressed genes, then connects these transcription factors using known PPI collected from 20 databases, and then X2K applies KEA to the network of connected transcription factors. Hence, X2K attempts to connect changes in expression to their upstream regulatory mechanisms and cell signaling pathways through transcription factors and protein interactions. The results from the X2K analysis are consistent and robust to different thresholds and enrichment tests. Finally, we asked about the overlapping genes induced or repressed by both kenpaullone and early Ebola infection (Supplementary Table S2). The most enriched gene ontology terms, MGI phenotypes and KEGG pathways that are upregulated by both Ebola infection and kenpaullone are related to the innate immune response and include the following genes: CIITA, LILRB1, RIPK1, CARD9, ALOX5AP, AHR, TLR4 and CTSC. These genes were reported to be regulated by STAT3 before based on two independent published ChIP-seq experiments from ENCODE and ChEA. STAT3 is a known inducer of the innate immune response and we predict that STAT3 activity is further induced by kenpaullone. However, validation of such prediction remains for future studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30574, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30585, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Overall, we obtained initial coherent mechanistic insights about the potential intracellular pathways that may be required for early Ebola infection, and identified a small molecule that can potentially interfere with this process. Our finding that a GSK3B inhibitor can potentially attenuate Ebola infection is supported by some additional evidence in the literature. Inhibitors of GSK3B were previously reported to decrease the acute inflammatory response following sepsis, protect multiple organ injury and reduce muscle protein degradation during sepsis. The glycolytic pathway implicated from our enrichment analysis is known to be linked to GSK3B activity and there is increasing appreciation that the glycolytic pathway is critical to the Ebola life cycle. The non-specificity of kenpaullone makes studying its molecular mechanisms and direct targets difficult. However, here we observe that kenpaullone induces the expression of immune response genes and as such it is potentially a general anti-viral candidate. A relatively old study showed evidence that treatment with interferon can improve outcome and survival of non-human primates infected with Ebola. However, interferons are known to cause severe side effects and may not be feasible to produce and deliver, that is why small molecules such as kenpaullone, which can potentially mimic/induce interferon are desired. The increase in the expression of innate immunity response genes by kenpaullone is predicted to assist infected cells and cells nearby infected cells to better sense the viral infection and respond quicker. It is still an open question whether kenpaullone interfere with the virus life cycle or just turns on the immune response. It is also not clear whether the induction of the viral innate immune response by kenpaullone is through the same pathway induced by Ebola or through a different mechanism. More specific small-molecule derivatives of kenpaullone have been developed, and could be tested in future studies for potency for inhibiting Ebola, and other similar pathogens.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 32649, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, here we introduced an improved computational method that potentially elevates the usefulness of a subset of the newly generated publicly available LINCS-L1000 data set to rapidly prioritize small molecules that could reverse or mimic expression in disease and other biological settings. The large collection of signatures computed by the CD method is delivered as a state-of-the-art web-based application that is already widely used. Besides prioritizing small molecules for reversing or mimicking an input signature, or pre-computed signatures for 670 diseases and a collection of endogenous ligands, the L1000CDS2 search engine web-based tool also predicts pairwise small-molecule combinations, performs substructure enrichment analysis and computes predicted targets based on an external set of signatures. The top predicted molecule to reverse expression in human cells infected with Ebola, kenpaullone, was shown to attenuate infection in a dose-dependent manner while not causing cellular toxicity in two cell lines. We also predicted the affected target genes and cell signaling pathways pointing to immune response genes driven by the inhibition of the CDK1-2 and GSK3B pathways, and potentially activating STAT signaling. However, kenpaullone should be tested in more cellular contexts before moving to animal models of Ebola. As kenpaullone is shown to induce an immune response that assists human cells to potentially combat Ebola infection, it is possible that this small molecule will have positive effects in blocking the spread of other viruses.
