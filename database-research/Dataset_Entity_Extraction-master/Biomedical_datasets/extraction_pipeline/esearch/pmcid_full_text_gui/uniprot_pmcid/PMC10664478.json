It ranks first in terms of cancer incidence among males and third among females in China. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Among them, LUAD represents approximately 50% of NSCLC cases. Currently, LUAD is classified into molecular subgroups based on genetic alterations, including those of EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF. Among these, EGFR gene-mutated LUAD is the most common form of adenocarcinoma in East Asia; it accounts for 47%-62% of LUAD cases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6676, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "According to the 2021 NCCN guidelines for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), osimertinib has become the recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ib-IIIa NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after surgery. This marks the entry of EGFR-targeted therapy into adjuvant treatment for early-stage lung cancer. For stage IV NSCLC patients with sensitive EGFR mutations, first-line treatment options with a level I recommendation include EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including first-, second-, and third-generation TKIs. For patients with oligoprogressive or central nervous system progression, the level I recommendation is to continue the original TKI treatment along with local therapy. In cases of widespread metastasis and treatment failure with first- or second-generation TKIs, rebiopsy is recommended. For patients with T790M-positive mutations, third-generation TKIs, such as osimertinib, furmonertinib, or almonertinib, are recommended. Osimertinib, compared to previous generations, irreversibly binds to mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletion), primarily targeting the kinase domain of EGFR. It competitively binds to the ATP-binding site on the kinase, inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation and blocking downstream signaling pathway activation. It exhibits higher selectivity for mutant EGFR over wild-type EGFR. EGFR-TKIs hold a significant position in the treatment of NSCLC patients. Studies have demonstrated significant benefits of EGFR-TKIs, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 9\u201313\u00a0months. However, acquired resistance ultimately develops. Currently, there are no effective clinical measures to address acquired resistance.

Among these TCMs, ZLJT (Approval Number Z20010064) is included in the 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia Part I. It is a compound formulation developed based on the theory of TCM. The main ingredients of ZLJT include Huangqi (Astragalus membranaceus), Danggui (Angelica sinensis), Baiying (Solanum lyratum Thunb.), Longkui (Solanum nigrum L.), Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), Shemei (Duchesnea indica), Banzhilian (Scutellaria barbata), and Yujin (Curcuma wenyujin/Curcuma Longa/Curcuma kwangsiensis/Curcuma phaeocaulis). Studies have shown that ZLJT has inhibitory effects on tumor occurrence and development, improves hematopoietic function, and enhances the body's immune system. It is widely used in patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Huangqi in the formulation can regulate macrophage polarization and synergistically enhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy drugs. Huangqi saponin IV, one of the main active components of Huangqi, can increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to gefitinib by modulating SIRT6. Danggui has been proven to suppress lung cancer progression, cancer cachexia, and cancer-related inflammation through its immunomodulatory functions. Baiying extract can enhance NK cell activity and increase the number of CD4 cells in tumor-bearing mice, significantly improving their survival rate. Longkui significantly increases downstream ROS production in a dose-dependent manner. ROS induce cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis in cancer cells through lipid peroxidation. Compounds in Danshen, such as cryptotanshinone (CTN), exhibit various biological activities, including antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects. CTN in the methanol extract of Danshen induces cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways and inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway mediated by PTEN, effectively suppressing tumor growth. Shemei inhibits cell growth. It reduces MMP-2 protein expression and MMP-2 activity in a dose-dependent manner and decreases phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its upstream kinases, thereby increasing antitumor metastasis activity. Banzhilian can induce cytotoxicity by regulating multiple apoptotic pathways in different NSCLC cells. Yujin has antitumor and antimetastatic activities. It inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis by regulating the expression of metastasis markers, including C\u2013C chemokine receptor type 7, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11146, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining EGFR-TKIs with ZLJT in delaying acquired resistance.

The results of the docking binding affinities are presented in Fig.\u00a010. The binding energy results of molecular docking between small molecules and large molecules are generally classified into three standards. A binding energy\u2009<\u2009-4.25\u00a0kcal/mol indicates a certain binding capability between the molecule and the target. A binding energy\u2009<\u2009-5.0\u00a0kcal/mol indicates a stronger binding capability, while a binding energy\u2009<\u2009-7.0\u00a0kcal/mol indicates a very strong binding capability. The magnitude of the binding energy can demonstrate whether there is binding capability between the small and large molecules. In addition to evaluating the binding energy, another criterion commonly used is the number of hydrogen bonds. It is generally considered that the formation of two or more hydrogen bonds indicates the formation of a stable conformation between large and small molecules. Among the active compounds that showed good performance in docking scores and binding modes with the 5 core target proteins (IL-6, FOS, STAT3, ERBB2, and EGF), luteolin, tanshinone IIA, and quercetin stood out. These compounds interacted with key amino acid residues, such as DA-20, DA-18, DG-19, DG-17, DC-26, DA-9, DG-10, and ARG-155. Luteolin contains multiple hydrophobic moieties, such as benzene rings and fused benzene rings, that can interact with other hydrophobic molecules, thus affecting their biological activity. In biological systems, luteolin and tanshinone IIA can interact with other molecules through hydrophobic interactions, thereby influencing their function and activity. Hydrophobic interactions can affect the interaction between tanshinone IIA and membrane proteins, enzymes, and other biological molecules, thereby affecting their biological effects and pharmacological properties. The hydrophobic moieties of quercetin can interact with other hydrophobic molecules, such as lipid bilayers and proteins, affecting cellular signal transduction, metabolism, enzyme activity, etc. Additionally, the hydrophobic moieties of quercetin can interact with hydrophobic amino acids in the cell membrane, influencing the stability and permeability of the cell membrane. Moreover, luteolin, tanshinone IIA, and quercetin showed a good match with the pocket of the FOS protein, and each part could interact well with the groove of the pocket. In summary, luteolin, tanshinone IIA, and quercetin exhibited the best binding affinity and docking scores with the FOS protein target among the active compounds.

Subsequently, we constructed a \"ZLJT-compound-target-disease\" regulatory network and identified the main active ingredients of ZLJT that have anti-LUAD cell resistance and inhibit tumor cell growth and migration, including quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, and tanshinone IIA. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid, is found in many fruits and vegetables. Related cell experiments have shown that quercetin can prevent lung cancer by scavenging free radicals, altering signal transduction pathways, inducing cell apoptosis, inhibiting phase I enzymes responsible for activating carcinogens, and inducing phase II enzymes responsible for detoxifying carcinogens. Clinical and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that quercetin possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and exerts antitumor activity in the prevention of tumor progression by modulating oxidative and inflammatory networks. An in vivo study found that luteolin inhibits NSCLC migration by controlling the actin cytoskeleton and inducing the migration-related proteins RAC1, CDC42, and RHOA. Furthermore, luteolin has been shown to inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation by blocking LIMK1 and its related signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Moreover, kaempferol intake significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and increases the bioavailability of various anticancer drugs. Tanshinone IIA exhibits anticancer activity in lung cancer cells. It induces autophagy and apoptosis and inhibits cell growth and migration by activating AMPK and inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Tanshinone IIA can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulating DR5 or selectively activating PERK/ATF4 and inhibiting STAT3. In summary, the active ingredients in ZLJT exert their anticancer resistance effects by altering signal transduction pathways, blocking the tumor cell cycle, inhibiting tumor activity, enhancing cell viability, and improving the bioavailability of combination drugs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48808, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PPI network analysis revealed that IL-6, FOS, STAT3, ErbB2, EGF, and other targets had high degree values and were the core targets of ZLJT in delaying LUAD resistance. IL-6 is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes, such as cell proliferation, inflammation, and stress. Cancer-related inflammation significantly affects cancer metastasis, clinical manifestations of cancer, and patients' tolerance to anticancer treatment. Effective inhibition of IL-6-induced signaling and transcription activator 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation can significantly downregulate the invasive ability of cancer cells. It has been found that A431-V tumors resistant to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors secrete more IL-6 and exhibit higher levels of phosphorylated STAT3. Additionally, blocking IL-6 signaling on tumor cells can overcome this resistance. In classic treatment for liver cancer, sorafenib can reverse resistance by blocking the IL-6 and AKT pathways. Therefore, the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway is involved in the process of tumor cell resistance. FOS is a proto-oncogene associated with cell proliferation. FOS gene expression is activated by the combined action of extracellular nucleotides and growth factors. FOS has been shown to be a regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. It has been reported that FOS plays a driving role in the development of lung cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer and is involved in resistance to multiple drugs. STAT3 is a transcription factor that, upon activation by growth factors and cytokines, participates in signal transduction and transcriptional activation. STAT3 is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival in various malignancies and is associated with angiogenesis and immune dysfunction in tumor development. Feedback activation of STAT3 plays a prominent role in mediating resistance to a wide range of targeted cancer therapies and chemotherapy and is considered an important target in anticancer drug resistance treatment. ErbB2 is a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family and plays a critical role in cell growth and proliferation signaling pathways. Amplification or overexpression of ErbB2 has been observed in 30% of breast cancer patients, driving cell transformation and cancer development. In LUAD, ErbB2 has been identified as one of the driver genes, and its inhibition can attenuate tumor progression and cell invasion. Expression profiling analysis in human lung tumors has confirmed the importance of the ErbB2/Akt/ELF3 signaling pathway as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic drug target for lung cancer treatment. EGF plays a significant role in tumor cell proliferation and signal transduction. EGF activates EGFR signaling and promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. In solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer, the EGFR family is an important target in anticancer therapy.

Additionally, the process involves epithelial cell proliferation since lung adenocarcinomas typically originate from epithelial tissues of the lungs. Understanding the mechanism of epithelial cell proliferation can provide valuable insights into the biology of lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, neuron death may be associated with the effects of neurons in lung adenocarcinoma. Abnormalities in the neuron death signaling pathway could be linked to the tumor microenvironment and treatment response, thus influencing the development of cancer treatment strategies and pathological analysis. In terms of CC, the cell projection membrane may play a role in the invasion and migration process of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Investigating this process can enhance our understanding of the metastatic mechanisms of cancer cells and potentially improve therapeutic strategies. If lung adenocarcinoma occurs near the nervous system, the pathway associated with the postsynaptic membrane may be affected, which could have implications for studying specific subtypes of lung adenocarcinomas and making therapeutic choices. Furthermore, leading edge membranes are often involved in the process of cell migration and infiltration, which is crucial for characterizing tumor aggressiveness and metastasis in lung adenocarcinomas. Lastly, the molecular functions mainly include protein heterodimerization activity, an important component in signaling pathways. Understanding these activities can provide insights into protein interactions associated with lung adenocarcinoma.

Inflammation and cancer are fundamentally linked in the processes of development, invasion, and metastasis. Components of cancer-related inflammation can downregulate the activity of cytolytic enzymes, influencing tumor progression. These components include chemokines, prostaglandins, and cytokines.

Additionally, tumor cells can synthesize exogenous lipids through uptake and activate endogenous lipids to promote tumor progression. ZLJT may intervene in drug resistance in lung adenocarcinoma by affecting pathways related to lipid metabolism.Another significant pathway is the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, which involves a set of neuroreceptors that may play a role in environmental information processing and signaling molecule interactions. This pathway may have a key role in the development and molecular specificity of lung cancer. Imbalances in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction may increase the risk of lung cancer.

This study provides insights for further mechanistic research and the clinical application of combating LUAD resistance. Therefore, more cell and animal experimental verification is still needed in the future to address the inherent limitations of this study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []},
