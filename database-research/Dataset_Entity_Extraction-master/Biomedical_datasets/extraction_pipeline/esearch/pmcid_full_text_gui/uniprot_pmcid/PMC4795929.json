In total, 59 721 human genes and 73 355 mouse genes have been imported from NCBI and 27 306 human proteins and 16 728 mouse proteins have been imported from the Swissprot subset of UniProt. As Wikidata is open and can be edited by anybody, our corpus of imported data serves as the starting point for integration of further data by scientists, the Wikidata community and citizen scientists alike. The first use case for these data is to populate Wikipedia Gene Wiki infoboxes directly from Wikidata with the data integrated above. This enables immediate updates of the Gene Wiki infoboxes as soon as the data in Wikidata are modified. Although Gene Wiki pages are currently only on the English language version of Wikipedia, the multilingual nature of Wikidata allows for usage of the data we imported in all 280 different language Wikipedias.

Biomedical knowledge is fragmented across many resources and databases, and small-scale data integration is an often-repeated exercise in almost every data analysis project. As for the language-specific Wikipedias, these small-scale integration efforts are incomplete, inefficient and error-prone. Instead, users now have the option of accessing and querying a central biomedical resource within Wikidata that is already pre-populated with many key resources and identifiers. While we certainly recognize that our effort does not yet include every resource in the biomedical space, Wikidata does empower any user to contribute data from their resource of interest. For example, any user could easily contribute data from other third party resources [e.g. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR), DECIPHER, COSMIC ] with minimal effort. These contributions can range from programmatic addition of large databases, to the output of medium-sized biocuration efforts, to individual statements added by individual users. We consider integration of data on human and mouse genes and proteins as the basis also for our own efforts with Wikidata. Figure 4 illustrates how the data could be used by the scientific community. The query returns all protein coding genes on a certain region of human chromosome 9, the chromosomal coordinates being based on the human genome build GRCh38. As NCBI gene nor a different resource provide a SPARQL endpoint with access to genomic coordinates, to the best of our knowledge, a similar query cannot be achieved with any other semantic web resource currently available. As the Gene Ontology terms are attached to human proteins, a slightly modified query would also allow functional annotation of the gene products, e.g. for copy number aberrations of cancer genomes, through executing a SPARQL query. Currently, tools like ANNOVAR provide richer annotation for variants and mutations, but Wikidata could e.g. prove useful for fast functional annotation of copy number aberrations in hereditary disease and cancer sequencing. With Wikidata growing, also the number of (annotation) use cases will increase. In addition to extending data in the biology and molecular biology space (e.g. cell lines, non-coding RNAs), we are currently importing data on human diseases and drugs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25282, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An important aspect of the broad applicability and reusability of Wikidata is its connection to the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data (Figure 4). Wikidata IDs give genes and proteins stable Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in the Semantic Web, which in turn link to other common identifiers used in the biomedical research community. Moreover, Wikidata provides perhaps the simplest interface for anyone to edit the Semantic Web, which is otherwise limited by high technical barriers to contribute. Similar or complementary efforts for integration of biomedical data are Bio2RDF and SNPedia. Bio2RDF integrates 37 different, well-established biomedical resources by defining an ontology for each data source and so converting them into normalized RDF documents. The Bio2RDF data integration effort currently is considerably larger than our project. Apart from that, the data models in Wikidata are not based on ontologies, but they are a product of community discussion. Only the basic Wikidata data model exists as an ontology (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/Indexing/RDF_Dump_Format), which allows all data and data models in Wikidata to exist within this one ontology, which simplifies creation of new data models but might complicate semantic reasoning. Another major difference is that Wikidata can be edited by any user whereas for Bio2RDF, additions or corrections need to be performed by the maintainers. Furthermore, integration of smaller biomedical databases, which exist in large numbers, seems to be easier with Wikidata, whereas Bio2RDF currently might be better suited for dealing with very large numbers of triples. Although Bio2RDF users who would like to integrate their data sources of interest in their analysis still have the option to create their own Bio2RDF compatible RDF conversions, we think that having the data ready to go in a triple store should considerably simplify data analysis.
