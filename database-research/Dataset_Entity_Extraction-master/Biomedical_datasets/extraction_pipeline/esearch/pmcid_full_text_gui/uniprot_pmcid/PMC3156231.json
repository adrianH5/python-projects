They regulate diverse functions, such as homeostasis, reproduction, development and metabolism. Therefore, NRs are a very important target for drug development. Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of phylogenetically related proteins and have been subdivided into different subfamilies due to their domain diversity. In this study, a two-level predictor, called NR-2L, was developed that can be used to identify a query protein as a nuclear receptor or not based on its sequence information alone; if it is, the prediction will be automatically continued to further identify it among the following seven subfamilies: (1) thyroid hormone like (NR1), (2) HNF4-like (NR2), (3) estrogen like, (4) nerve growth factor IB-like (NR4), (5) fushi tarazu-F1 like (NR5), (6) germ cell nuclear factor like (NR6), and (7) knirps like (NR0). The identification was made by the Fuzzy K nearest neighbor (FK-NN) classifier based on the pseudo amino acid composition formed by incorporating various physicochemical and statistical features derived from the protein sequences, such as amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, complexity factor, and low-frequency Fourier spectrum components. As a demonstration, it was shown through some benchmark datasets derived from the NucleaRDB and UniProt with low redundancy that the overall success rates achieved by the jackknife test were about 93% and 89% in the first and second level, respectively. The high success rates indicate that the novel two-level predictor can be a useful vehicle for identifying NRs and their subfamilies.

They function as ligand-activated transcription factors, thus providing a direct link between signaling molecules that control these processes and transcriptional responses. Many of these receptors are potential targets for the therapy of diseases such as breast cancer, diabetes, inflammatory diseases or osteoporosis. Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of phylogenetically-related proteins, which share a common structural organization. The N-terminal region (A/B domain) is highly variable, and contains at least one constitutionally active transactivation region (AT-1) and several autonomous transactivation domains (AD); A/B domains are variable in length, from less than 50 to more than 500 amino acids. The most conserved region is the DNA binding domain (DBD, C domain), which contains a short motif responsible for DNA-binding specificity on sequences typically containing the AGGTCT motif. A non-conserved hinge (D domain) is between the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domain, and contains the nuclear localization signal. The ligand-binding domain (LBD, E domain) is the largest domain. It is responsible for many functions, such as ligand induced, transactivation, and repression. The F domain is in the C terminus of the E domain, whose sequence is extremely variable and whose structure and function are unknown.

(2) The cutoff threshold set by them to remove homologous sequences was 90%, meaning that the benchmark dataset thus constructed would allow inclusion of those proteins which have up to 90% pairwise sequence identity to others.

For detailed information about the database, refer to the NucleaRDB (http://www.receptors.org/NR/). Because the NucleaRDB has not provided the nuclear receptor sequences in FASTA format, we read Web content at the specified URL and extract all entries by the text-parsing method. The initial data set had 727 sequences belonging to seven subfamilies of nuclear receptors. To avoid any homology bias, a redundancy cutoff was imposed with the program CD-HIT to winnow those sequences which have  pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset except for the subfamily NR6 because it contained only 5 nuclear receptor protein sequences. If the redundancy-cutoff operation was also executed on this class, the samples left would be too few to have any statistical significance. The final benchmark dataset, , thus obtained contains 159 sequences classified into seven different subfamilies of NRs as shown in  Table 1 , where 500 non-NRs protein sequences were also collected in for training the predictor to identifying non-NRs. The protein sequences in were randomly collected from the UniProt at http://www.uniprot.org/ according their annotations in the \u201cKeyword\u201d field, followed by undergoing the similar redundancy-cutoff operation to assure that none of the proteins in has  pairwise sequence identity to any other.

In terms of these property values the protein sequence can be converted to a digit signal, for which we implement the discrete Fourier transform, obtaining the frequency-domain values,where j represents the imaginary number. For each  we can calculate its amplitude components  and phase components   Where abs gets the complex magnitude and angle gets the phase angle. Thus we can generate 2L discrete Fourier spectrum numbers as given below:The 2L Fourier spectrum numbers contain substantial information about the digit signal, and thereby can also be used to reflect characters of the sequence order of a protein. Furthermore, in the L phase components , the high-frequency components are noisier and hence only the low-frequency components are more important. This is just like the case of protein internal motions where the low-frequency components are functionally more important. For certain physicochemical property, accordingly, we only need to consider the 1st 10 phase components as well as their corresponding amplitudes, i.e.As for the physicochemical property values, we adopted the hydrophobicity of each constituent amino acid, and its hydrophilicity and side-chain mass as done in. These values can be obtained from the web-site at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/PseAAC/PseAAReadme.htm.

The NR-2L predictor developed in this study can be used to address this kind of problems. The high success rates achieved by NR-2L have once again indicated that it is indeed an effective approach by fussing several different kinds of sequence-derived features into PseAAC to formulate protein samples for identifying their attributes. It is anticipated that NR-2L may become a useful tool in speeding up the pace of characterizing newly found nuclear receptor proteins or at least may play an important complementary role to the other methods in this regard. For the convenience of biologists and pharmacologists in using NR-2L, a user-friendly web-server for NR-2L has been established at http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/NR2L, by which users can easily obtain the desired results in a short period of time even for a large number of query protein sequences. Furthermore, as a backup, the web-server for NR-2L can also be accessed at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/NR2L in case the former link is down.
