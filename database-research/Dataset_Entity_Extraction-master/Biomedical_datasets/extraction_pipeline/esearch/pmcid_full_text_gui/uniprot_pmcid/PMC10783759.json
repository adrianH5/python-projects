However, automation of functional clustering based on phylogenetic trees has been challenging and most of it is done manually. Clustering phylogenetic trees usually requires the delineation of tree-based thresholds (e.g., distances), leading to an ad hoc problem. We propose a new phylogenetic clustering approach that identifies clusters without using ad hoc distances or other pre-defined values. Our workflow combines uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) with Gaussian mixture models as a k-means like procedure to automatically group sequences into clusters. We then apply a \u201csecond pass\u201d clade identification algorithm to resolve non-monophyletic groups. We tested our approach with several well-curated protein families (outer membrane porins, acyltransferase, and nuclear receptors) and showed our automated methods recapitulated known subfamilies. We also applied our methods to a broad range of different protein families from multiple databases, including Pfam, PANTHER, and UniProt, and to alignments of RNA viral genomes. Our results showed that AutoPhy rapidly generated monophyletic clusters (subfamilies) within phylogenetic trees evolving at very different rates both within and among phylogenies. The phylogenetic clusters generated by AutoPhy resolved misannotations and identified new protein functional groups and novel viral strains.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1629, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1642, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The advent of deep sequence technologies, and the subsequent drop in the price of sequencing, has dramatically increased the rate of data acquisition for genomics, metagenomics, and transcriptomics. This development required the creation of faster and more accurate computational and bioinformatics algorithms, as well as a need for databases and search tools that can rapidly identify gene functions. Perhaps the most widely used method for protein function and family identification is the profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a Markov chain Monte Carlo sequence site transition model built from distantly related proteins of similar function with sequence gaps included in the scoring. Profile HMM algorithms such as HMMER implemented in Pfam provide rapid and accurate protein function identification and database search tools. While Pfam is largely concerned with broad functional identification of proteins at the family level, there is also a tremendous diversity of functions within Pfam families and many differentiated functional roles are collapsed within HMM models. These protein subfamilies share the basic function of the family, but also contain many unique properties that confer a different substrate specificity or functional role of the protein.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2906, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The diverse bacterial family of porins illustrates this point. Outer membrane porins (OMPs) are proteins that form pores or channels in bacterial membranes that allow the passive diffusion of a variety of soluble molecules such as sugars. Some OMPs are highly selective and only diffuse certain molecules (e.g., maltose by maltoporin, oligosaccharides by OmpG, long-chain fatty acids by FadL) while others, known as general diffusion porins, have no substrate specificity, though they may favor certain ions. Although OMPs are distantly related sequences with similar basic structure and function, there are very distinct OMPs within that have discrete and even novel functions. Search methods that identify broad functional categories, such as profile HMMs, detect fundamental properties of all OMPs but miss a lot of their functional subfamily diversity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3763, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In combination with these broad classification approaches, phylogenetic methods provide a potentially powerful means of identifying important functional subfamily diversity within these larger classifications because they can be used to determine well-supported monophyletic clades of protein sequences within these families. In addition, phylogenetic branch length information can be used to identify highly divergent sequences (including large insertions and deletions) indicative of novel functional structures or motifs that may confer distinct functional properties. Phylogenetic methods have been, and are currently being, used to identify and classify protein functions. For example, the TreeFam and PANTHER databases use phylogenetics to identify protein subfamilies by partitioning the trees. While these databases are very useful resources, both rely on manual curation by a team of biologists and are not automated. This clearly becomes problematic as datasets continue to increase in size.

Sjolander 1998 developed an automated method based on optimizing an encoded cost of a multiple sequence alignment(MSA) of a protein family. However, this method was not strictly based on phylogenetic trees and has not been substantially tested. Another method known as Secator used neighbor-joining trees (BIONJ) to assign dissimilarity values to nodes, allowing them to be collapsed into subfamilies at significant dissimilarity values.

Another method called PhyCLIP determines clusters in a phylogenetic tree using an optimization equation with parameters such as a minimum number of sequences to solve the partitioning problem. Although these methods are partially automated, both require the selection of arbitrary parameters (i.e. alpha and a minimum sequences number) to group tips of the tree by partitioning at edges.

The viral datasets did not require a gamma model to represent multiple site rates because the percent of invariant sites was so large that it could be assumed there are only two rates of site changes those that do (uniform rate) and those that do not (no rate). The JTT+I model utilized for viral datasets was better than JTT+GI and JTT+G because JTT+I trace converges and mixes well as opposed to the others trace which did not mix well. The length of the Monte Carlo Markov Chain was adjusted based on the size of the dataset. First, the length of the MCMC was 10 million and sampled every 1000. If the trace did not converge or mix enough due to size of data set or complexity of model, the length of the MCMC was increased to 1 billion and sampled every 10,000. The first 10% of the samples were discarded as burn-in following visual inspection in Tracer v1.7.1. The program Tree Annotator v2.6.4 was used to identify the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and to summarize the posterior of trees sampled by BEAST2 (Median node heights).

Next, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce the dimensionality of the PDM to 2 dimensions for clustering (\u201cReduce dimensionality of PDM\u201d). UMAP maintains the topology relationships between the rows in a data matrix while reducing the number of columns/dimensions to a size that humans can visualize (e.g., 2 to 3 dimensions), and to a size that eliminates noise for computers to cluster (2 to 10 dimensions). We then applied Gaussian mixture models fitted with Expectation maximization (GMMEM) to model Gaussian distributions where each distribution is a cluster of the reduced matrix (\u201cFit, score, and increment Gaussian Models GMMEM\u201d). To determine the best fit number of Gaussian distributions or clusters are required to fit the data, models of increasing number of Gaussian distributions were scored using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). BIC is a model selection score that balances a model\u2019s fit vs. its complexity (number of dimensions), with lower BIC scores optimizing this balance.

In addition to protein subfamily clustering, AutoPhy also identified phylogenetic clusters in rapidly evolving viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), and is highly robust to highly differential rates of evolution both among and within phylogenies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29706, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "AutoPhy rapidly clusters even very large phylogenetic trees (i.e., trees with many sequences), though the speed of the clustering is dependent on the tree topology. The time it took to cluster protein families into monophyletic groups ranged from 4 sec for the Ski oncogene, PNTHR10005 (55 protein sequences), to 46 sec for the helicaseC protein family, PF00271, (421 protein sequences; Table 2). The phylogenetic trees that took the shortest amounts of time to analyze tended to have discrete clusters separated by long branch lengths from other groups. The Ski oncogene tree contained many tightly bound subtrees with larger branch lengths leading to the cluster (S1 Fig), whereas the smaller helicaseC phylogeny had much sorter subtending branches (S2 Fig). This pattern also held for the analyses of the virus phylogenies. The number of sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny was less than twice the size of the Mumps phylogeny, but the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny took 28 times longer. A comparison of the two phylogenies reveals that there were many visually distinct, subtrees in the mumps phylogeny than in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (S3 and S4 Figs).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30872, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A run-time analysis of AutoPhy\u2019s algorithmic workflow found that for most of the phylogenies, the PDM creation took 2~% of the total time, while the UMAP took 17\u201328% of total time, GMMEM analysis required 20\u201355% of the total time, and the MCIM required between 25\u201370% of the total run time. However, in the case of the trees with long run times (e.g., the SARS-CoV-2, Mumps, and helicaseC phylogenies), 70% of the total run time was spent on the MCIM step. In other words, if the clusters from UMAP-GMMEM successfully identified monophyletic groups based on the PDM, very little time was spent on the MCIM step. The UMAP-GMMEM step appeared to have the most difficulty with polyphyletic sequences that were closely related and had long intra- but short inter-distances. For example, the UMAP-GMMEM analysis of the BSH tree clustered two groups as polyphyletic groups when related back to the tree, groups 1 and 8 (Fig 7A). In both cases, the polyphyletic clustering was due to a singleton sequence with a short internode distance (groups 3.1, 5.1, and 12.2, Fig 7B). Similar patterns can be observed with the analysis of the OMP proteins (e.g., groups 4, 21, and 23; Figs 4B and 6). Given these results, we suggest that improving the speed and efficiency of the MCIMalgorithm, (e.g., by converting from Python to C), followed by speed improvements to UMAP-GMMEM, would provide the greatest overall run time decrease for AutoPhy, especially with difficult to resolve phylogenies like the SARS-CoV-2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32379, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A detailed inspection of the clustering results of the well-studied and annotated protein families found that the AutoPhy clustering identified most of the functional subfamily annotations within the same monophyletic group, though in many cases these subfamilies included other closely related sequences. For example, AutoPhy placed the TOLCs efflux pumps that transfer small molecules such as antibiotics across the bacterial outer membrane of bacteria within a clade (group 6, Fig 6, S5 Fig) that also included the OMP5 and BEPC proteins, which are also known for their antibiotic resistance activity. Another two clusters included the multi-drug resistance OMPs MdtQ (group 16) and MdtP (group 5), and the 8 nucleoside-specific channel porins TSX (group 8). In other cases, the annotated sequences did not have enough sequences to form a discrete clade, such as the OMP5 and BEPC grouped into TOLC. There were also a few cases in which AutoPhy split sequences with the same annotation into different clusters, such as the OMPA sequences, two (group 0.1) of which did not cluster with the larger OMPA groups (groups 2, 15, 17, 0.0). A visual examination of the phylogeny shows that these two OMPAs from group 0.1 were significantly evolutionarily divergent from the others, suggesting they may have evolved unique functional roles.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33714, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In other cases, AutoPhy identified interesting subfamily clusters within protein families which may indicate novel functional roles. For example, all the BSH sequences were annotated as choloylglycine hydrolases (Table 1). However, a visual inspection of the BSH tree clearly indicates the BSH phylogeny includes several distinct monophyletic groups (Fig 7B) and AutoPhy split the sequences into probable subfamilies likely differing in kinetic characteristics or substrate activation. In the acyltransferases, most sequences with the same annotations (e.g., gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)) were clustered by AutoPhy (group 29.0, Fig 7B). One exception was the membrane-bound palmitoyltransferases (ZDH) which were split into three groups of only ZDH annotated sequences. The bigger AutoPhy-identified cluster of ZDH (group 11) are Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum bound and provide a variety of palmitoyl protein substrates The other two ZDH groups identified by AutoPhy (groups 2 and 17) included ZDH14, which may regulate G-protein-couple receptor signaling (PubMed:27481942), ZDH11, a palmitoyltransferase involved in immune response, and ZH11B, a probable membrane-bound palmitoyltransferase involved in cell signaling in an immune response.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34961, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The fact that separate ZDH clusters detected by AutoPhy contained distinct groups of functions indicates that AutoPhy can identify novel functional roles in previously annotated sequences. Finally, in the AutoPhy analysis of the nuclear receptors from UniProt, proteins with the same annotations (e.g., BMP(12), PIAS (14), and PARQ(6)) all clustered together with additional, closely related sequences (Fig 7E and 7F). For example, the sequence with UniProt accession number Q9H255 annotated O51E2 grouped inside a clade of PARQ sequences (group 3). Interestingly, O51E2 is likely functionally related to the PAQR proteins. Both are membrane receptors, but the PARQ proteins bind steroid receptors while the O51E2 substrate is unknown. Based on these results, receptor molecules for PARQ and O51E2 are most likely very similar. We hypothesize that the O51E2 substrate is an aromatic lipid with a steroid hormone-like structure. In addition to the automated monophyletic clustering, AutoPhy includes downstream analyses for further investigation of these clusters such as a log ratio approach for analyzing the relative evolutionary divergence rates among clusters. The relative evolutionary divergence of identified AutoPhy clusters revealed by the log ratio analysis indicates AutoPhy determined monophyletic groups under potential purifying selection at the amino acid level. For example, group 9.1 in the OMP tree (Fig 8B), groups 6 in the BSH tree (Fig 8C), and group 4.2 in the AT tree (Fig 8D) have the lowest within group divergences compared to the rest of the subfamilies within the tree.

Parsimony randomization tests using the first three letters of the annotations showed that such a close relationship between our clusters and the annotations was nearly impossible by chance (example S6 Fig). The highly non-random association between the phylogenetic clustering and these annotations provides independent confirmation of our approach.

Autophy tends to over split clades, particularly when there are long branches such as with the Acetyltransferases (Fig 7D). AutoPhy analysis also produced many cluster groups containing only one or two sequences, but this would likely be resolved with greater sequence sampling. In addition to speed, improvements noted earlier, other improvements to AutoPhy might include optimizing the number of UMAP dimensions for GMMEM clustering and including additional analysis to identify functional singletons in groups. Likewise, gaps could be added to the transition matrix to improve its estimated gap probability at sites. Lastly, the code is written in R notebooks and Python GitHub package. This is excellent for demonstration and reproducibility, but for creating databases or large-scale implementation needs to be configured as a more organized python package as a command-line tool. In addition to novel protein subfamily function identification and viral strain analysis, there are numerous other potential applications for AutoPhy. First, AutoPhy could be applied to metagenomic datasets to phylogenetically bin sequences by subfamily in a feature count table. This would allow for more refined metagenomic questions to be asked involving differentially present subfamilies. For example, a comparison of BSH abundance at the family level between conditions (e.g., healthy vs. dysbiotic gut microbiome samples) might not reveal any differences. However, in the same samples we might see a clear difference in the abundances of specific AutoPhy identified subfamily clusters within the BSHs. AutoPhy could also prove useful for automatically identifying different novel subfamilies present in the genomes of the same organisms, thereby identifying paralogs and functional misannotations. Finally, Autophy could also refine protein-matching. AutoPhy clusters could be used at the basis for subfamily-HMM models to refine protein matching to finer annotation. Finally, given the success of AutoPhy with RNA viral genomes, AutoPhy could potentially be applied to databases of RNA families.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39702, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we demonstrate that AutoPhy rapidly automates phylogenetic clustering of protein families with highly differentiated rates of evolution without the need for ad hoc parameters.
