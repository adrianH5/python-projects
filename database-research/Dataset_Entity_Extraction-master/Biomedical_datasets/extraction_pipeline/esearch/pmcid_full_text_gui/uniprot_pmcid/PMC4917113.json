Our analysis platform exploits a suite of in-house and public tools to identify Functional Determinants (FDs), i.e. residue sites, responsible for conferring different phenotypes between different classes, different types and different variants. We focused on Class A beta-lactamases, the most highly populated and clinically relevant class, to identify FDs implicated in the distinct phenotypes associated with different Class A Types and Variants. We show that our FunFHMMer method can separate the known beta-lactamase classes and identify those positions likely to be responsible for the different implementations of the mechanism of action in these enzymes. Two novel algorithms, ASSP and SSPA, allow detection of FD sites likely to contribute to the broadening of the substrate profiles. Using our approaches, we recognise 151 Class A types in UniProt.

Furthermore, microbiome sequences are sometimes incomplete and a preliminary analysis of BLAST matches revealed incomplete sequences with > 60% identity to a Class A beta-lactamase but lacking fragments of sequence containing the catalytic or FD residues, making it impossible to identify the type.

This had 37% sequence identity to the closest Class A beta-lactamase in our CATH-Gene3D dataset, marking it out as a novel type. This was confirmed by the detection of a unique FD triplet, IQA (combination 1 in Table 8). This sequence was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and its activity was tested against a range of beta-lactam compounds known to be acted on by Class A beta-lactamases (see Methods). For this purpose, a qualitative agar-diffusion test was performed with the following antibiotics: amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin and carbenicillin at concentrations of 2, 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcg/ml. The size of zone of inhibition around 10 and 20 \u03bcg/ml of amoxicillin suggested that both with the native signal and the pelB signal, candidate beta-lactamase could give resistance to this antibiotic and that the one with native signal has higher activity. 5 different concentrations of amoxicillin were then tested: 10 (the lowest concentration that inhibited growth), 15, 20, 25, 30 \u03bcg/ml, all of which gave positive results. The agar-diffusion test was also performed with higher concentrations of ampicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin and carbenicillin: 10, 20, 25, 50 \u03bcg/ml. The size of zones of inhibition suggests that the candidate beta-lactamase could also give resistance to ampicillin, again the protein with native signal has higher activity.
