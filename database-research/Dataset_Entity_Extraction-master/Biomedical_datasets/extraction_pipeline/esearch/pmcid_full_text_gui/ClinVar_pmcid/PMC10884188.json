In this study, we report a case of a Russian family with a history of GM1 gangliosidosis. The family had a child who, from the age of 6\u00a0months, experienced a gradual loss of developmental skills, marked by muscle flaccidity, psychomotor retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and the onset of tonic seizures by the age of 8\u00a0months. Funduscopic examination revealed a \u00abcherry red spot\u00bb in the macula, which is crucial for the diagnosis of lipid storage disorders. To find the pathogenic variants responsible for these clinical symptoms, the next-generation sequencing approach was used. The analysis revealed two variants in the heterozygous state: a frameshift variant c.699delG (rs1452318343, ClinVar ID 928700) in exon 6 and a missense variant c.809A>C (rs371546950, ClinVar ID 198727) in exon 8 of the GLB1 gene. The spouses were advised to plan the pregnancy with assisted reproductive technology (ART), followed by preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorder (PGT-M) on the embryos. Trophectoderm biopsy was performed on 8 out of 10 resulting embryos at the blastocyst stage. To perform PGT-M, we developed a novel testing system, allowing for direct analysis of disease-causing mutations, as well as haplotype analysis based on the study of polymorphic markers\u2014short tandem repeats (STR), located upstream and downstream of the GLB1 gene. The results showed that four embryos were heterozygous carriers of pathogenic variants in the GLB1 gene (#1, 2, 5, 8). Two embryos had a compound heterozygous genotype (#3, 4), while the embryos #7 and 9 did not carry disease-causing alleles of the GLB1 gene. The embryo #7 without pathogenic variants was transferred after consideration of its morphology and growth rate. Prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester showed the absence of the variants analyzed in the GLB1 gene in the fetus.

The most common and severe is infantile form, often resulting in fatal outcomes. Clinical symptoms in infantile form of the GM1-gangliosidosis type 1 (GM1G1) appear in the first 12\u00a0months of the child\u2019s life, but can be detected prenatally. Examination of the fetus with GM1 gangliosidosis may reveal nonimmune hydrops fetalis, intrauterine growth restriction, and placental vacuolization, congenital dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spots). About 50% of affected children have cherry-red maculae, identifiable during an ophthalmological examination, which can help make the diagnosis. As the child grows older, muscle hypotonia, hepatosplenomegaly, generalized skeletal dysplasia of varying severity, developmental delay, nystagmus, strabismus, corneal opacities, vision and hearing loss, gingival hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, coarse facial features, and seizure syndrome may appear. The infantile phenotype is terminal and results in death before the age of 4\u00a0years. Diagnosis of GLB1-related disorder in a proband is established by identifying two pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants of the GLB1 gene and/or by detecting a significant decrease in \u03b2-galactosidase activity in leukocytes or peripheral blood fibroblasts. Only one method is required to establish a diagnosis; the other can be used in combination to confirm the diagnosis or, in some cases, to determine genotype-phenotype correlation. The GLB1 gene is situated on the short arm of chromosome 3 and encompasses 16 exons. More than 200 pathogenic variants in the GLB1 gene have been identified to date, most of which are located within exons 2 and 6.

The GM1 gangliosidosis risk was previously reported to be associated with ethnicity and genetic ancestry. The higher frequencies were shown for specific regions, such as Malta and Brazil. The founder mutation R59H (rs72555392) in the GLB1 gene causing infantile GM1 gangliosidosis was previously described in an isolated population of Romani people in Bulgaria. In Russia the genetics of GM1 gangliosidosis has not been sufficiently studied. In our study, we assessed the AF of P/LP variants in the GLB1 gene causal to GM1 gangliosidosis in the Russian population based on information from the new RUSeq database. In total, only 12 out of 180 reported P/LP GLB1 variants in ClinVar were identified in RUSeq data. The variant rs1452318343 was reported in gnomAD, ClinVar, and RUSeq (cohort of diseased individuals) databases. Previously it was found in multiple patients with infantile form of GM1 gangliosidosis from Ukraine. The variant rs371546950 was not described in any of the analyzed databases.
