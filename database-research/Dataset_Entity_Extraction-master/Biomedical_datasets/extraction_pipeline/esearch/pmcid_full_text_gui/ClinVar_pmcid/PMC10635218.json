Interestingly, analysis of ClinVar for nonsynonymous Likely Benign variants returned no variants that met gnomAD allele frequency, CADD, and SpliceAI filtering criteria. Of note, although not analyzed further, there are many variants currently classified as VUSs in ClinVar that meet these criteria and have the potential to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic pending further assessment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24711, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Potential misclassification of disease-relevant variants as B/LB may represent a systematic problem with the sole use of older algorithms designed to detect potential splicing defects. Variants that are farther from the splice site, either intronic or synonymous, are typically not subject to functional evaluation by clinical pipelines. As seen in Variant B (2 families), Variant H (1 family), and Variant I (2 families), patients with no other reportable variants displayed phenotypes consistent with monoallelic loss-of-function variants, in DICER1 and PALB2 respectively. It is important to note that all 9 of the variants predicted by SpliceAI to cause missplicing result in the use of aberrant splice sites (at distances up to dozens of nucleotides away) that are not found in any known transcript and are outside the range of other splice prediction algorithms. Biological validation through analysis of patient RNA and in vitro splicing assays confirm: 1) the limitations of only using a scoring algorithm that does not characterize all variants; 2) the scoring guidelines for SpliceAI from the original paper [\u201cconfidently predicted cryptic splice variants(score \u2265 0.5)\u201d] are too conservative; and 3) variants scoring above 0.20 via SpliceAI should be considered potential missplicing variants consistent with the recently published ClinGen guidance. Across the nine variants assessed, we also identified a correlation between increased SpliceAI scores and abnormal products produced through the in vitro splicing assay, with the strongest correlation being seen with the increased SpliceAI donor or acceptor loss score (Additional File 2: Figure S1C). Though this is a limited analysis, splice variants do not always affect splicing in a binary manner, and it is possible that increasingly large SpliceAI scores may act as further evidence for classifying a variant\u2019s effect on splicing (i.e., while 0.2 is a useful threshold, larger values may provide even more evidence) as seen for missense predictors. We have additionally demonstrated that as SpliceAI donor or acceptor loss scores decrease towards the 0.2 cut-off, the proportion of abnormal products detected by our splice reporter assays are increasingly variable.
