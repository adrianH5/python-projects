ClinVar-reported variants E1230K, E1295K, and R1739W/Q and other variants in loops IVP2-S6, IIIS1-S2, and IIIS3-S4 are associated with cardiac arrhythmias, highlighting the interface between IVP2-S6 and VSD-III as a hot spot of disease mutations. Atomic mechanisms of the channel dysfunction caused by these mutations are unknown. Here, we generated mutants E1295R, R1739E, E1295R/R1739E, and N1736R, expressed them in HEK-293T cells, and explored biophysical properties. Mutation E1295R reduced steady-state fast inactivation and enhanced steady-state slow inactivation. In contrast, mutation R1739E slightly enhanced fast inactivation and attenuated slow inactivation. Characteristics of the double mutant E1295R/R1739E were rather similar to those of the wild-type channel. Mutation N1736R attenuated slow inactivation. Molecular modeling predicted salt bridging of R1739E with the outermost lysine in the activated voltage-sensing helix IIIS4. In contrast, the loss-of-function substitution E1295R repelled R1739, thus destabilizing the activated VSD-III in agreement with our data that E1295R caused a depolarizing shift of the G-V curve. In silico deactivation of VSD-III with constraint-maintained salt bridge E1295-R1739 resulted in the following changes: 1) contacts between IIIS4 and IVS5 were switched; 2) contacts of the linker-helix IIIS4-S5 with IVS5, IVS6, and fast inactivation tripeptide IFM were modified; 3) contacts of the IFM tripeptide with helices IVS5 and IVS6 were altered; 4) mobile loop IVP2-S6 shifted helix IVP2 that contributes to the slow inactivation gate and helix IVS6 that contributes to the fast inactivation gate. The likelihood of salt bridge E1295-R1739 in deactivated VSD-III is supported by Poisson\u2013Boltzmann calculations and state-dependent energetics of loop IVP2-S6.

The Nav1.9 channel has unique electrophysiological properties among Nav1.x channels, including extremely slow inactivation. In view of our proposition that loop IVP2-S6 mediates the signal transmission from VSD-III to the SF gate, the ultra-slow inactivation of Nav1.9 may indicate that motions of VSD-III are not transmitted to the SF gate and the inactivation is triggered by another mechanism.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42461, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our experimental data show the functional importance of residues R1739, E1295, and N1736. However, the fact that electrophysiological characteristics of the double mutant R1739E/E1295R are rather similar to those of the WT channel does not necessarily mean that R1739 and E1295 form a salt bridge in the resting VSD-III. Further experiments such as locking VSD-III in the deactivated state with disulfide or metal ion bridges are necessary to demonstrate direct interactions of these residues. Meanwhile, the possibility of the salt bridge is supported by the following indirect evidences. 1) The charge elimination in BrS-associated variants R1739Q/W or change reversal in disease variant R1295K (Figure 3B) implies the involvement of these residues in functionally important electrostatic interactions. In the cryo-EM structure 6lqa, E1295 is the closest acidic residue to attract R1739. 2) According to our computations, IVP2-S6 \u201cenjoys\u201d rather than resists the coupled downshift with IIIS4 (Figure 7D). 3) In the resting VSD-III, E1295 creates a cation-attractive potential for R1739 (Figure 9E). 4) Some analogy of the state-dependent contacts between VSD-III and loop IVP2-S6 may be found in the cryo-EM structures of rNav1.5, where loops IP2-S6 and IVS3-S4 are rather far from each other in the activated state of IVS4 but form a close contact in the resting state (Figure 2D). 5) The proposed mechanism explains why multiple mutations in the putative pathway of the motion transmission from VSD-III to the SF gate are associated with the loss-of-function Brugada syndrome (Figure 3B).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44058, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, here, we generated four mutants at the interface of VSD-III with the extracellular loop IVP2-S6, expressed the mutants in HEK-293T cells and explored their electrophysiological properties. Mutation E1295R in loop IIIS3-S4 demonstrated the strongest impact on the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation. Based on molecular modeling, we propose that E1295 forms a state-dependent salt bridge with R1739, the only basic residue in helix IVP2-S6 that approaches E1295 in the cryo-EM structure of quinidine-bound hNav1.5. We further propose that contacts between VSD-III and loop IVP2-S6 mediate transmission of the voltage-dependent motions from VSD-III to the SF gate and contribute to motion transmission from VSD-III to the fast inactivation gate. Our study suggests a possibility of allosteric signal transmission between VSD-III and the inactivation gates in the cardiac sodium channel.
