Furthermore, the longest period between conflicting interpretations also had the lowest proportion of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (34.1%) reported as the most recent interpretation. This finding suggests that, over time, laboratories may be using additional information (eg, population studies) to downgrade the importance of previously reported variants. The shorter periods between conflicting interpretations (<1 year and 1-2 years) had approximately equal proportions of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance reported in the most recent interpretation. We believe this finding suggests that the passage of time (>2 years) is more likely to result in downgrading compared with upgrading of the clinical importance of variants.

A total of 19 interpretations included information about de novo variants in the ClinVar database submissions. Twelve of these interpretations used the information about a de novo variant to interpret a variant as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, which accounted for a small number of cases (12 of 201 [6.0%]). Patients and physicians should recognize that differences in genetic variant interpretations may occur and can be clinically substantial. In addition to reporting their assessment of a genetic variation, clinical laboratories should also report whether there is known diagnostic uncertainty among clinical laboratories. It may be prudent for clinical teams to use public databases like ClinVar to identify whether conflicts or updates among variant interpretations exist. Notably, even well-studied genes with therapeutic implications, such as SCN1A, can have clinically substantial discordance in variant interpretation. Another strategy used to resolve discrepancies in interpretation has been to identify laboratories that have interpretations that are outliers from other clinical laboratories.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17916, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To provide context for interlaboratory discrepancies, the practice of surgical pathology can be examined.

In the subspecialty of hematopathology, 16% of cases have been noted to have diagnostic differences, with 5% of differences having implications for patient care. Tertiary care centers routinely perform secondary reviews of surgical pathology cases before recommending definitive therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Such a practice of secondary review may be prudent in genomics when a variant is in conflict.

The major limitation was that the study was based on a database with variant, but not patient-level, information. Therefore, this study did not examine the discordance in interpretations based on patients but rather on specific variants. A given patient may have had multiple genetic variants identified from a genomic test; each variant may have had differences in interpretation. In addition, without patient-level data, the study could not assess the frequency of single-variant changes in autosomal disorders compared with 2-variant changes in autosomal-recessive disorders. Another limitation of this study was that discordance could have occurred because some laboratories did not update their ClinVar entries. In addition, when we examined the association of de novo variants with the frequency of conflicts, our analysis was limited by the fact that inherited vs de novo status was not consistently reported in the ClinVar database.
