MH is commonly due to protein-altering variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommends that when pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S are incidentally found, they should be reported to the carriers. The detection of actionable variants allows the avoidance of exposure to triggering agents during anesthesia. First, we report a 10-year-old Icelandic proband with a suspected MH event, harboring a heterozygous missense variant NM_000540.2:c.6710G>A r.(6710g>a) p.(Cys2237Tyr) in the RYR1 gene that is likely pathogenic. The variant is private to four individuals within a three-generation family and absent from 62,240 whole-genome sequenced (WGS) Icelanders. Haplotype sharing and WGS revealed that the variant occurred as a somatic mosaicism also present in germline of the proband\u2019s paternal grandmother. Second, using a set of 62,240 Icelanders with WGS, we assessed the carrier frequency of actionable pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S. We observed 13 actionable variants in RYR1, based on ClinVar classifications, carried by 43 Icelanders, and no actionable variant in CACNA1S. One in 1450 Icelanders carries an actionable variant for MH.

The \u201cgold standard\u201d for diagnosis of MH has been in vitro contracture test of muscle fibers in the presence of caffeine and halothane. However, this test requires a surgical biopsy and is relatively complex to perform, so the conduct of these tests has been centralized to highly specialized laboratories. Currently, genetic testing may also be conducted to confirm diagnosis of MH susceptibility. MH is most commonly due to protein-altering variants in the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene, and less frequently in a gene producing calcium channel alpha-1s subunit (CACNA1S). Numerous sequence variants within those genes and others with a potential association with MH have been described, many of unknown significance. It is challenging to rule out MH susceptibility in individuals with pathogenic RYR1 variants considering the incomplete penetrance of MH susceptibility, and individuals do not always exhibit symptoms following initial exposure to triggering agents. The revised European Malignant Hyperthermia Group guidelines recommend that an individual carrying a potentially MH-associated variant should be considered at risk of MH until contracture testing can be performed. Furthermore, RYR1 and CACNA1S are listed among the 59 genes with recommendations to report incidental findings of medically actionable variants by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). In the last decade, the cost of whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has decreased allowing clinical application more feasible.

guidelines recommend reporting of incidental findings in RYR1 and CACNA1S of previously classified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in the context of MH. By October 2020, a total of 2728 coding or splice site variants in RYR1 are represented in ClinVar of which 367 are considered to be actionable since they are classified as pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic, after excluding variants with conflicting interpretation. The annotation in ClinVar database is not specific for a given phenotype; however, individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants linked to RYR1-associated myopathies are reported to be at risk for MH during general anesthesia and should avoid triggering anesthetics. In a set of 62 thousand WGS Icelanders, we detected 369 coding or splice variants in RYR1 with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.1% (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Out of these 369 variants (MAF\u2009<\u20090.1%), we observed 13 actionable variants carried by 43 out of 62 thousand WGS Icelanders. This corresponds to a carrier frequency of 1 in 1450 of actionable RYR1 variant, or 0.069% (out of all WGS Icelanders). Through imputation (166K chip-genotyped Icelanders) and Sanger sequencing of relatives, we identified 39 additional carriers of actionable RYR1 variants, bringing the total to 82 carriers. This results in 1 in every 2000 individuals (chip-genotyped Icelanders) carrying a known pathogenic variant in RYR1 (Tables\u00a01 and 2). For CACNA1S, a total of 764 coding or splice site variants are represented in ClinVar, of which 36 variants are considered to be actionable. We detected 125 coding or splice site variants in CACNA1S with MAF\u2009<\u20090.1% out of 62K WGS Icelanders (Supplementary Table\u00a02), but none are actionable (Table\u00a01).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18473, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18484, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "First, we present a case of MH in a 10-year-old boy harboring a family-specific variant in RYR1, p.(Cys2237Tyr), which is classified as likely pathogenic.

It should be noted that while additional dantrolene was given in the ICU, it is not required after normalization of PaCO2 and with a decreased core temperature, although monitoring is required. When the clinical status of the proband was applied to the clinical grading scale to predict MH susceptibility, the proband received a score of 70 pts (15 pts each for masseter spasm, CK elevation, respiratory acidosis, inappropriate temperature increase, and 10 pts for acidosis), rendering the likelihood of an MH episode as almost certain. According to the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group, the suggested diagnostic pathway for patients with MH suspicion includes either genetic testing or in vitro contracture testing, which has largely been centralized to increase diagnostic accuracy. A genetic workup was performed identifying a RYR1 variant (p.(Cys2237Tyr), chr19:38,496,455 [hg38]). The p.(Cys2237Tyr) variant is rare, absent from 212 thousand individuals in gnomAD reference database (v2.1 and v3.0). This same variant was reported positive for in vitro contracture testing in a case, and pathogenic prediction tools identify a high risk of damaging effect to the protein function. Therefore, the variant classifies as likely pathogenic based on both MHS/RYR1-specific adaptation of the ACMG criteria, and the genetic scoring matrix from The European Malignant Hyperthermia group. This variant is currently not listed in ClinVar, a genotype\u2013phenotype relationship reference database. The frequency of a sequence variant is a key determinant in the classification of pathogenicity, but it can be difficult to assess precisely. In Iceland, the extent of WGS and genotyping of 20% and 50% of the population, respectively, allows us to precisely determine the allelic frequency, the background haplotype, and the generation where the mutation that led to the variant happened. The p.(Cys2237Tyr) mutation led to mosaicism present in both germline cells of the proband\u2019s paternal grandmother and her somatic cells (II-5). This variant was then inherited by three of her descendants, including the MH proband. Previously, this variant was reported once in a single individual outside of Iceland with an episode of MH, indicating that the variant identified in the Icelandic proband corresponds to a recurrent mutation. We note that the variant is located in MH domain 2, a region enriched for pathogenic missense variants between residues 2162 and 2458. The genetic workup identified two other alive family members without an anesthetic exposure who are likely to be susceptible to MH, out of 14 tested family members. Given the large size of the RYR1 gene (5038 amino acids, and ranks 27th largest out of 19,689 genes) and multiple variants within the gene that are of uncertain clinical significance, it is of utmost importance to attempt a molecular diagnosis of MH cases, and to distribute information about pathogenic variants.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21962, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on a large set of WGS Icelanders (n\u2009=\u200962 thousand), we determined that 1 in 1450 individuals carries one of the 13 actionable variants likely to cause MH in Iceland, all within RYR1 (Table\u00a02).
