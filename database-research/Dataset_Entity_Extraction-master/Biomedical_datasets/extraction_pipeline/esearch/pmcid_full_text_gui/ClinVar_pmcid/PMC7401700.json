MARRVEL (Model organism Aggregated Resources for Rare Variant ExpLoration) is a one-stop data collection tool for human genes and variants and their orthologous genes in seven model organisms including in mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode worm, fission yeast and budding yeast. In this Protocol, we provide an overview of what MARRVEL can be used for and discuss how different data sets can be used to assess whether a variant of unknown significance (VUS) in a known disease -causing gene or a variant in a gene of uncertain significance (GUS) may be pathogenic. This protocol will guide a user through searching multiple human databases simultaneously starting with a human gene with or without a variant of interest. We also discuss how to utilize data from OMIM, ExAC/gnomAD, ClinVar, Geno2MP, DGV and DECHIPHER. Moreover, we illustrate how to interpret a list of ortholog candidate genes, expression patterns, and GO terms in model organisms associated with each human gene. Furthermore, we discuss the value protein structural domain annotations provided and explain how to use the multiple species protein alignment feature to assess whether a variant of interest affects an evolutionarily conserved domain or amino acid.

Whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses reveal numerous rare variants of unknown significance (VUS) in known disease -causing genes as well as variants in genes that are yet to be associated with a Mendelian disease (GUS: genes of uncertain significance). Presented with a list of genes and variants in a clinical sequence report, medical geneticists must manually visit multiple online resources to obtain more information to assess which variant maybe responsible for a certain phenotype seen in the patient of interest. This process is time consuming and its efficacy is highly dependent on the expertise of the individual. Although several guideline papers have been published, interpretation of WES and WGS requires manual curation since there is yet to be a standardized methodology for variant analysis. For the interpretation of VUS, knowledge on the previously reported genotype-phenotype relationship, mode of inheritance, and allele frequencies in the general population become valuable. In addition, knowledge on whether the variant affects a critical protein domain or an evolutionarily conserved residue may increase or decrease the likelihood of pathogenicity.

In addition, since most model organism databases are designed for researchers who work with the specific organism on a daily basis, it is very difficult, for example, for a mouse researcher to search for specific information in a Drosophila database and vice versa.

For example, a missense (17:59477596 G>A, p.R20Q) variant in TBX2 was found to segregate in an autosomal dominant manner in a small family with dysmorphic features and cleft palate, cardiac defects, skeletal and digit abnormalities, thyroid-related phenotypes and immune defects. The mother and two children affected with these symptoms carried the variant, whereas the father did not. The 9 year old son had the most severe phenotype, whereas the 36 year old mother and the 6 year old daughter had milder forms of this disease. To assess whether this variant is likely pathogenic, one can start a MARRVEL search by entering the gene and variants on the starting page on http://MARRVEL.org. Note that the variant search bar requires the removal of \u201cChr\u201d in front of the variant if this is listed in the original clinical report to indicate \u201cChromosome\u201d. At the time of the original study, the results page showed that there is no OMIM phenotype associated with this gene, and this variant is found only once in gnomAD but not in ExAC, ClinVar, or Geno 2MP. One may think this identification of one individual may be evidence against p.R20Q being a pathogenic variant, but it is important to note that the mother of the family exhibited mild form of the disease. A variant found in 1/~150,000 individual is indeed a very rare variant and the identification of an individual with the identical variant maybe explained by reduced expressivity or penetrance. In the Gene Function table, it is often helpful to check if the gene is expressed in relevant tissues in humans (via GTEx and Protein Atlas) in reference to the phenotypes of the patient.

Phenotypic information in mouse and zebrafish indicates that this gene affects development or function of a number of tissues including cardiovascular system, craniofacial/palate and digits. In sum, these data suggest that this variant is possibly pathogenic and further functional study is valuable. Considering that the gene and variant is conserved in organisms like C. elegans and Drosophila, functional studies in invertebrate animals will be faster and cheaper compared to performing the same experiment in vertebrate model organisms such as zebrafish, mouse and rat. Please see the accompanying article by Harnish et al. regarding how we designed and performed functional assays for this case.

The four genes have different DIOPT scores (10/12 for NOTCH1, 8/12 for NOTCH2 and NOTCH3, 5/12 for NOTCH4) due to the degree of homology between fly N and each human gene. Considering the \u201cBest score from Human gene to Fly\u201d is listed as \u201cYes\u201d for all four genes, the reverse search from each human gene picks up the fly N gene as the most likely ortholog candidate.

By clicking the \u201cMARRVEL it\u201d buttons for each human gene, one can obtain the human gene-based outputs for NOTCH1-4. On the results page of each gene, the top boxes for OMIM indicate that while NOTCH1, 2, and 3 are associated with genetic diseases, NOTCH4 is currently not associated with any human diseases. Note that there have been debates on whether variants in NOTCH4 are associated with schizophrenia based on genome -wide association studies (GWAS). Since OMIM generally does not curate GWAS data with some exceptions (e.g. APOE, PTPN22), this information is not available from the OMIM window.

For MARRVEL\u2019s purposes, ExAC serves as the best control population minor allele frequency. We are interested in two sets of outputs from ExAC. The first output is the gene-centric overview of the expected versus observed number of missense and loss of function alleles. A metric called pLI (probability of Loss of function intolerance) ranges between 0 and 1 is likely related to how essential both copies of a gene are before reproductive age. A pLI score of 1 means that this gene is very intolerant of any loss of function variants and is under selective constraint. The second output is data from ExAC that pertains to the specific variant.\tPMID: 27535533\t \tHuman Genetics\tgnomAD\thttp://gnomad.broadinstitute.org\tgnomAd contains a total of 123,136 exome sequences and 15,496 whole-genome sequences from unrelated individuals sequenced as part of various disease-specific and population genetic studies.
