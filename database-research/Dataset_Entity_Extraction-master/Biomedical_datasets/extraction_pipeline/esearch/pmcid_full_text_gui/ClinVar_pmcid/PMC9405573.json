Recent advances in sequencing and screening of the NF1 gene have increased the number of detected variants. However, the correlation of these variants with the clinic remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed 4610 germinal NF1 variants annotated in ClinVar and determined on exon level the mutational spectrum and potential pathogenic regions. Then, a binomial and sliding windows test using 783 benign and 938 pathogenic NF1 variants were analyzed against functional and structural regions of neurofibromin. The distribution of synonymous, missense, and frameshift variants are statistically significant in certain regions of neurofibromin suggesting that the type of variant and its associated phenotype may depend on protein disorder. Indeed, there is a negative correlation between the pathogenic fraction prediction and the disorder data, suggesting that the higher an intrinsically disordered region is, the lower the pathogenic fraction is and vice versa. Most pathogenic variants are associated to NF1 and our analysis suggests that GRD, CSRD, TBD, and Armadillo1 domains are hotspots in neurofibromin.

The NF1 gene, located in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17q11.2, spans 350 kb of genomic DNA which contains 60 exons that encode a transcript in the direction from the centromere to the telomere, giving rise to a mRNA of 11 to 13 kb with an open reading frame of 9 kb. NF1 occurs as a result of a germline mutation in 1 of the 2 alleles of the NF1 gene. However, somatic loss of function in the second allele is required for tumor formation. The allele responsible for NF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and the NF1 phenotype is complex due to variable expressivity and pleiotropy. The phenotypic complexity of NF1 is likely multifactorial, including epigenetic phenomena, stochastic events, and heritable elements such as genetic modifiers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2524, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP) that promotes the conversion of an active Ras-GTP bound form to an inactivate Ras-GDP form and functions to negatively regulate the activity of Ras/MAPK, Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Rho/ROCK/LIMK2/cofilin, PKA-Ena/VASP, and cAMP/PKA pathways, which when left unchecked, results in a cellular overproliferation and tumor formation. Neurofibromin is ubiquitously expressed and is present in most tissues acting as a tumor suppressor protein but most highly in particularly high levels in the central nervous system, including Schwann cells along peripheral nerve trunks, glial cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes leukocytes, adrenal medulla, and neurons, which partially explains the predilection for peripheral nerve sheath tumors and gliomas. Neurofibromin has several predicted functional domains and regions including the PKC domain (protein kinase C, 97\u2013243 residues), CSRD (cysteine-serine rich domain, 543\u2013909 residues), TBD (tubulin binding domain, residues 1095\u20131197), GRD (GAP-related domain, residues 1198\u20131530), Poly-Ser (1352\u20131355 residues), Sec14-PH (also known as CRAL-TRIO lipid binding domain, residues 1560\u20131816), Armadillo-type fold superfamily domains (residues 1849\u20131886, 1920\u20131984 and 2200\u20132571), the CTD (C-terminal domain, residues 2260\u20132818) including NLS (bipartite nuclear localization signal domain, 2534\u20132550 residues), and SBR (syndecan-binding regions, residues 1357\u20131473 and 2619\u20132719).

Despite there being evidence that synonymous mutations frequently contribute to human cancer, such studies have not been performed in NF1 yet, perhaps assuming that synonymous mutations may not alter neurofibromin function. To the best of our knowledge, no germline NF1 silent mutations have been associated to cancer or neurofibromatosis type 1 so far. On the other hand, 938 (20%) variants are predicted to be pathogenic. The remaining variants (2889, 63%) were excluded from this study based on their uncertain phenotypic classification. Indeed, since the discovery of NF1, due to its large size and the heterogeneity of mutation types and positions, it has been difficult to predict and identify the impact of most mutations. Furthermore, phenotypic differences in NF1 patients are more likely to be caused by mechanisms such as \u201ca second hit\u201d, modifying genes that are unlinked to the NF1 locus, epigenetic alterations, or other environmental factors. Therefore, more translational studies are needed to pinpoint the impact of variants in NF1 etiology.

These three regions harbor 43.5% (408/938) of the pathogenic NF1 variants used in this study. Both the binomial and sliding windows tests carried out in this study were concordant with each other, strongly supporting the existence of these three hotspots in neurofibromin in the onset of germinal mutations. The analysis of the NF1 gene is challenging and previous studies were not able to prove the existence of hotspots areas in NF1, suggesting the lack of mutation hotspots. However, a limited number of mutational hotspots were identified in the coding sequence of NF1: a recurrent missense mutation Y489C (A1466G) associated with aberrant splicing in exon 10b, codons 844-848 in the CSRD, 992 and 1149 in the TBD, 1276 and 1423 in the GRD, 1809 in the PH, R1947X (C5839T) in exon 31, and the 4-bp region between nucleotides 6789 and 6792 in exon 37. In addition, apart from exon 37, mutations distributed along the NF1 gene in NF1 patients showed other seven exons/flanking introns in which mutations are represented more often (4b, 7, 10b, 13, 15, 20, and 29), where 77 of the 189 identified mutations are located (41%), although they represent only 16% of the coding region. Locally, the GRD region has been proposed to be a hotspot for missense mutations. All the above mutations were associated with NF1 phenotypes. Interestingly, previous hotspots 844\u2013848, 992, 1276, and 1423 do correlate with our findings as hotspot areas. Our results strongly support the existence of hotspot areas within neurofibromin CSRD, GRD, and Armadillo 1 domains.

The limitations encountered due to the reduced number of variants annotated may be overcome with more analyses using future releases of the databases containing deeper variants information. Regarding the CSRD domain, previous studies suggested that patients harboring mutations in this domain had a higher risk of developing optic pathway glioma OPG than patients with mutations in other regions, however, further studies are still needed to confirm associations between NF1 genotype and OPG phenotype. On the other hand, the risk of developing a glioma was not associated with particular patterns of NF1 gene mutations in the patient\u2019s germline DNA.
