In this study, a new model of immune-related genes was developed to predict the overall survival and immunotherapy efficacy in patients with ccRCC. Immune-related genes were obtained from the ImmPort database. Clinical data and transcriptomics of ccRCC samples were downloaded from GSE29609 and The Cancer Genome Atlas. An immune-related gene-based prognostic model (IRGPM) was developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression algorithm and multivariate Cox regression. The reliability of the developed models was evaluated by Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves. Furthermore, we constructed a nomogram based on the IRGPM and multiple clinicopathological factors, along with a calibration curve to examine the predictive power of the nomogram. Overall, this study investigated the association of IRGPM with immunotherapeutic efficacy, immune checkpoints, and immune cell infiltration. Eleven IRGs based on 528 ccRCC samples significantly associated with survival were used to construct the IRGPM. Remarkably, the IRGPM, which consists of 11 hub genes (SAA1, IL4, PLAUR, PLXNB3, ANGPTL3, AMH, KLRC2, NR3C2, KL, CSF2, and SEMA3G), was found to predict the survival of ccRCC patients accurately. The calibration curve revealed that the nomogram developed with the IRGPM showed high predictive performance for the survival probability of ccRCC patients. Moreover, the IRGPM subgroups showed different levels of immune checkpoints and immune cell infiltration in patients with ccRCC. IRGPM might be a promising biomarker of immunotherapeutic responses in patients with ccRCC. Overall, the established IRGPM was valuable for predicting survival, reflecting the immunotherapy response and immune microenvironment in patients with ccRCC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2019, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2032, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, accounting for nearly 90% of all kidney cancers.

RCC consists of three main histological subtypes with different molecular and genetic characteristics; clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most extensive histological subtype (approximately 80%). Even in patients with localized ccRCC, surgical resection, which is considered the best treatment choice, is associated with a high rate of recurrence. However, due to the anatomical location of the kidneys early symptoms in many patients with ccRCC are subtle and easily overlooked leading to delayed diagnosis. Consequently, by the time of diagnosis, metastases are already advanced in many cases. Over the past 20\u00a0years, there has been limited progress in ccRCC prognosis.

Figure\u00a06A demonstrates that the low riskscore group was significantly positively correlated to CD274, PDCD1LG2, and HAVCR2, while it was negatively correlated to CTLA-4, TIGIT, LAG3, and PDCD1. The findings exhibited that the low riskscore group is involved in better immunotherapy efficacy of ICBs of CD274, PDCD1LG2, and HAVCR2, and their high expression is related to a better prognosis. The high riskscore group will benefit more from immunotherapy efficacy from ICBs of CTLA-4, TIGIT, LAG3, and PDCD1. IPS was found to be a promising index for evaluating the ICBs therapy response, and higher IPS indicated better immunotherapy response. A higher PD1/PDL1/PDL2 and IPS\u2013CTLA4 blocker score was observed in the high riskscore group (Fig.\u00a06B) The results of immunotherapy response are consistent with immunecheckpoint, a higher PDCD1 and CTLA-4 expression was observed in the high riskscore group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19550, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19561, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In recent years, immunotherapy has gained popularity as a treatment for various cancers, including ccRCC.

While some researchers have developed prognostic indicators based on miRNAs, lncRNAs, or mRNA, we believe that an immune gene-based signature is more appropriate for predicting the prognosis in immunotherapy. Eleven optimal IRGs-based models were established as follows: SAA1, IL4, PLAUR, PLXNB3, ANGPTL3, AMH, KLRC2, NR3C2, KL, CSF2, and SEMA3G. Among these 11 IRGs, some have been found to be closely associated with immune cells.\u00a0SAA1 is involved in the activation of monocytes and macrophages during inflammation. IL-4 functions as a T-cell-derived B-cell growth factor. ANGPTL3 plays an active role in the Treg expansion function. KLRC4 participates in the antitumor immune role of the NK cells. NR3C2 and CSF2 are correlated with macrophage polarization and activation. Some genes might be implicated in immunomodulatory activities, such as PLAUR, PLXNB3, AMH, KL, and SEMA3G. A previous study obtained data from the TCGA database and established a model based on 14 IRGs using the LASSO-COX method. Unfortunately, the model suffers from platform bias and lacks validation data from other databases. Zhou et al. developed a prognostic model for immune-related genes pairs through bioinformatics analysis of papillary renal cell carcinoma; however, this model did not include clinical variables.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21569, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To further assess the clinical effect of IRGPM, we studied its relationship with clinicopathological factors, IPS, and immune cell infiltration. First, we found that poorer pathologic state, higher histologic state, male sex, and higher TNM stage were associated with the high-risk group, suggesting that our prediction model is accurate in predicting the progression of ccRCC. Second, we assessed the proportion of immune cells in ccRCC samples. Studies have shown that the interaction between the microenvironment and the tumor is a determining factor in ccRCC progression. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of IRGPM to display the prognostic value of immune cells and immune cell infiltration. M0 macrophages and Tregs have been reported to promote tumor progression in various cancers , which are consistent with our study that high riskscore patients showed a higher enrichment of these cells. Interestingly, our study suggests that NK cells enhance the immune response and lead to a better prognosis based on TCGA-KIRC cohort (Fig.\u00a05A). Conversely, analysis from TIMER in our study showed that high infiltration levels of activated NK cells is associated with poor prognosis (Fig.\u00a05D). The potential reason of the inconsistent is that NK cells exert both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects in ccRCC. NK cells facilitate tumor growth and angiogenesis by releasing cytokines and growth factors in ccRCC. NK cells can directly recognize and killing ccRCC cells and activating other immune cells (T cells) to eliminate the ccRCC cells. Another possible reason of the inconsistent is that the two results are based on different genomic data. Previously study demonstrated that enriched DCs were found to be closely associated with dysfunctional T cells, resulting in poor patient survival. Similarly, our results indicated that the high riskscore group exhibited higher DC cell infiltration (Fig.\u00a05A). Finally, we assessed immune checkpoint therapy in patients with ccRCC and found that the high riskscore group presented better IPS involving CTLA4 and PD1/PDL1/PDL2 combination blockades. This indicates that the high-risk group was more immunogenic to ICBs.
