In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the fields of tumor and immunity. This study focused on the possible prognostic value of immune genes in non-small cell lung cancer patients. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to download gene expression data and clinical information of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). The immune gene list was downloaded from the Immport database. We then constructed immune gene prognostic models on the basis of Cox regression analysis. We further evaluated the clinical significance of the models via survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and independent prognostic factor analysis. Moreover, we analyzed the associations of prognostic models with both mutation burdens and neoantigens. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Kaplan\u2013Meier plotter databases, we evaluated the validity of the prognostic models. The prognostic model of LUAD included 13 immune genes, and the prognostic model of LUSC contained 10 immune genes. High-risk patients based on prognostic models had a lower 5-year survival rate than did low-risk patients. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated the prediction accuracy of the prognostic models, as the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.742, 0.707, and 0.711 for LUAD, and 0.668, 0.703, and 0.668 for LUSC, when the predicted survival times were 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The mutation burden analysis showed that mutation level was associated with the risk score in patients with LUAD. The analysis based on GEO and Kaplan\u2013Meier plotter demonstrated the prognostic validity of the models. Therefore, immune gene-related models of LUAD and LUSC can predict prognosis. Further study of these genes may enable us to better distinguish between LUAD and LUSC and lead to improvement in immunotherapy for lung cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2042, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2055, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It was estimated that lung cancer would lead to the largest number of cancer-related deaths in both male and female patients by 2020.

CRABP1, which is associated with antimicrobial immunity according to the immune gene classification from the Immport database, is closely related to immune cell proliferation and apoptosis via the ERK signaling pathway. A study showed that mRNA and protein levels of CRABP1 were increased in 42% and 50% of NSCLC patients, respectively. To date, no studies have described in detail the action mechanisms of CRABP1 in lung cancer. RBP2 was found to increase the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in NK cells by interacting with the P50 and Socs1 promoters as well as to cause the demethylation of H3K4me3 in the Socs1 promoter, further upregulating IFN-\u03b3 levels. Moreover, RBP2 decreased the expression of E-cadherin by binding to its promoter, which was induced by TGF-\u03b21, and promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer. An in-depth exploration of RBP2 function in lung cancer is warranted, as RBP2 is involved in cancer progression by not only influencing cancer-related pathways but also by regulating the innate immune response. Serum FGF2 levels are related to poor prognosis in advanced NSCLC patients by promoting angiogenesis. It was well-proven that BTK, as a crucial effector to promote B cell development, played an oncogenic role in B cell malignancies; however, recent studies have shown that BTK enhances the functions of tumor suppressors, including p53 and p73, in LUAD (H1299) and colon cancer (HCT116) cell lines. It has been reported that SEMA4B inhibits tumor cell growth and metastasis in NSCLC by suppressing the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The function of IL-11 in lung cancer has not been extensively studied. Only 1 article has shown that IL-11 promotes tumor cell growth, invasion, and metastasis in LUAD. Singh et al. demonstrated that INK, as a good diagnostic and prognostic marker of ovarian cancers, also plays a role in promoting tumor metastasis and angiogenesis in other cancers, which may offer new vascular targets for cancer therapy. ANGPTL4 has an effect on enhancing lung cancer cell invasion and migration partially through the ERK signaling pathway. LGR4 belongs to a G-protein coupled receptor and is involved in activating the Wnt signaling pathway to influence tumor progression. The NCBI gene database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/) shows that TNFRSF11A regulates the interaction between dendritic cells and T cells to change adaptive immune responses, and activates the NF-kappa B and MAPK8/JNK signaling pathways. Despite its possible immense impact on anti-tumor immune responses and cancer development, there are no studies related to TNFRSF11A in LUAD. It has been experimentally shown in a recent study that VIPR1 serves as a tumor suppressor in LUAD, which is consistent with our results. Our results showed that SHC3 served as a possible favorable factor for patients with LUAD. The Immport database revealed that SHC3 is associated with the function of NK cells. Meanwhile, the NCBI gene database also showed that SHC3 is present at relatively high levels in normal lung tissue. However, studies on SHC3 in lung cancer are lacking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 23315, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although the single immune gene in the LUSC model had no significant association with prognosis, by retrieving literature in PubMed, we found that CXCL5 could promote tumor progression in colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, osteosarcoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma. As a chemokine, CXCL5 recruits neutrophils and promotes angiogenesis. PLAU, which converts plasminogen to plasmin and increases the migration ability of tumor cells, was found to be a positive regulatory factor of colorectal cancer. RNASE7 is a possible tumor suppressor in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. SEMA4C, as the target of cancer-related miRNAs, is down-regulated, which reverses EMT, in lung cancer. Serum APLN levels increased significantly in LUSC compared to those in other lung cancer types or control groups. The expression of TSLP in breast cancer tissue was higher than that in normal tissues and benign tumors. JUN is considered an immune-related biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma, which influences the active states of B cells and T cells. The NCBI gene database shows that IGKV1-6 and TRAV39 are related to the functions of B cells and T cells, respectively. However, at present, a search on the corresponding studies of the 2 genes does not display information in PubMed. Compared to FGF2 with high expression levels in LUAD, FGFR4 was more highly expressed in LUSC.

In another study, the prognostic model was constructed by selecting differentially expressed genes based on the ESTIMATE algorithm-derived immune scores. Although we used the same database compared with these studies, different analysis methods have generated different models, which will require further experimental validation. Recently, Shi et al. completed a similar study that used the lasso algorithm and multivariate Cox regression analysis to construct a prognostic model of immune genes in LUAD. Their results also demonstrated that ANGPTL4 is a promising immune gene for LUAD prognosis. Although there was a relatively large number of immune genes in our models, we suggest that it is appropriate to retain these genes in the models as they play an important role in the immune system and cancer progression. Above all, we also note that the genes in the prognostic models regulate innate and adaptive immune responses in various ways, which inspires us to uncover the interaction between these immune genes and tumor-related immune responses. These prognostic models will be better applied in the clinic to evaluate patient prognosis and guide immunotherapy. Kunimasa et al. systematically summarized the lung cancer-related immune responses.
