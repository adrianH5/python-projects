In recent times, the incidence of ASD is growing at a rapid pace. In spite of great endeavors devoted to explaining ASD pathophysiology, its precise etiology remains unresolved. ASD pathogenesis is related to different phenomena associated with the immune system; however, the mechanisms behind these immune phenomena as well as the potential contributing genes remain unclear. In the current work, we used a bioinformatics approach to describe the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-associated competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in the peripheral blood (PB) samples to figure out the molecular regulatory procedures involved in ASD better. The Gene Expression Omnibus database was used to obtain the PB microarray dataset (GSE89594) from the subjects suffering from ASD and control subjects, containing the data related to both mRNAs and lncRNAs. The list of immune-related genes was obtained from the ImmPort database. In order to determine the immune-related differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), the limma package of R software was used. A protein-protein interaction network was developed for the immune-related DEmRNAs. By employing the Human MicroRNA Disease Database, DIANA-LncBase, and DIANA-TarBase databases, the RNA interaction pairs were determined. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient to discover the positive correlations between DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs within the ceRNA network. Finally, the lncRNA-associated ceRNA network was created based on DElncRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interactions and co-expression interactions. In addition, the KEGG enrichment analysis was conducted for immune-related DEmRNAs found within the constructed network. This work found four potential DElncRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA axes in ASD pathogenesis, including, LINC00472/hsa-miR-221-3p/PTPN11, ANP32A-IT1/hsa-miR-182-5p/S100A2, LINC00472/hsa-miR-132-3p/S100A2, and RBM26-AS1/hsa-miR-182-5p/S100A2.

ASD includes weak interpersonal communication, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. Although an occurrence of 1 in 160 children has been recorded worldwide, there are some differences in ASD epidemiology in different parts of the world. These differences might be attributable to various identification and screening methods, differences in community identification or diagnosis, and possible risk factors. ASD is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a disorder harboring two types of symptoms: ineffective communication and social connection, and repetitive and limited behavior. As a result, autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger\u2019s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Rett\u2019s disorder are now included in the definition of ASD. This broad spectrum creates variations in terms of the diagnosis of ASD regarding the earlier edition of DSM. Many efforts have been made to establish ASD pathogenesis; nevertheless, it remains mostly mysterious. Genetic, environmental, immunological, and neurological variables are thought to have a role in ASD development. Several immunological anomalies, such as humoral and cellular immune responses, as well as molecular abnormalities, have been documented. There is evidence of changed immune functions in both PB and cerebrospinal fluid. Multiple reports postulate an involvement of neuroinflammation in ASD, which is supported by examinations on cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue, as well as indications of microglial activation.

As a result, a combined study of non-coding RNAs and protein-encoding genes might aid in elucidating the underlying immunological processes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have a role in a variety of biological processes, including cell differentiation, immunological responses, and development. They also function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). The ceRNA theory proposes cross-talks between coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs via miRNA response elements (MREs), which are miRNA complementary sequences, establishing a large-scale regulatory network in different regions of the transcriptome. According to this hypothesis, two RNA transcripts are regulated through a process mediated by ceRNAs, which results in expressing the two RNA transcripts through indirect correlation with the expression of target miRNAs. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation in the expression of these two RNA transcripts. The disruption of the equilibrium of ceRNA cross-talks has been linked to a number of disorders. Nevertheless, it is unknown if ceRNA plays a role in AD-related immunological responses.

Numerous studies have found that ceRNA regulatory axes plus accompanying networks are functional in a range of developmental pathways and pathological situations, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and mental disorders. LncRNAs have an important function in the control of physiological and pathological processes as a significant category of RNAs in the ceRNA machinery. The expression level of lncRNAs has been discovered to be altered by a variety of mental disorders. Based on the aforementioned theoretical notions, the ceRNA regulatory network associated with lncRNAs can perform critical roles in ASD etiology. So far, research studies on the ceRNA network implicated in ASD-associated immunity have been inadequate, and more study on the associated expression patterns and processes is required. In this study, we used a publicly accessible database for downloading the expression profiles related to PB samples from patients with ASD to analyze the immune-related DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs in ASD and healthy samples.

Several studies suggest that LINC00472 has an essential function in the inhibition process of tumor development. In acute hepatic damage induced by sepsis and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, LINC00472 controls immune-related genes via functioning as ceRNA for biding to various miRNAs. ANP32A-IT1 is the intronic transcript 1 of the ANP32A. ANP32A is widely recognized to be involved in neuritogenesis, brain development, and neuron differentiation. The regulation of ANP32A signaling might help control oxidative stress in the brain and recover cognitive function, perhaps with therapeutic applications for neurological diseases. Even though the roles of ANP32A have been discovered, the activity of ANP32A-IT1 is yet unknown. A recent research study showed ANP32A-IT1 dysregulation in the PB mononuclear cells of schizophrenia patients compared to healthy subjects. RBM26-AS1 is an antisense lncRNA, and no known function has yet been assigned to RBM26-AS1. Because the host transcript may be controlled by the same numbers of antisense transcripts, the adjacent RBM26 gene might clarify the corresponding contributions of this lncRNA. RBM26 is an RNA binding motif protein that participates in the polyadenylated RNA turnover in mammalian nuclei. The Poly(A) Tail eXosome Targeting (PAXT) connection promotes the recruiting process of the human ribonucleolytic RNA exosome to nuclear polyadenylated RNA. RBM26, as a new factor, is required for the PAXT function. Two previous integrated analysis studies reported that RBM26-AS1 acts as a ceRNA in high-glucose-induced human retinal endothelial cells and pancreatic cancer.

According to the HMDD database, hsa-miR-221-3p is dysregulated in olfactory mucosal stem cells taken from ASD patients in comparison with healthy controls, and hsa-miR-221-3p also exhibits significant neuronal expression in areas crucial for high cognitive skills in the brain of mice.

Besides the RAS pathway, it has been demonstrated that SHP2 can also activate the PI3K-AKT pathway, whilst inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway. In addition, the PTPN11 gene mutations are predominantly related to RASopathies, including Noonan syndrome (NS), and cognitive deficits such as learning disabilities are common in patients with NS. According to the previous works, the higher severity and prevalence of autism symptoms in RASopathies indicate that during development, the dysregulation of Ras/MAPK signaling may be implicated in ASD risk. S100A2 is a member of the EF-hand motif family S1007. The family of S100 is comprised of more than twenty members of highly-conserved acidic proteins binding to calcium with a wide range of extracellular and intracellular functions, including regulation of cell apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, energy metabolism, inflammation, migration, protein phosphorylation, and calcium balance. Numerous S100 proteins are known for being overexpressed in cancers, among which S100A2 is believed to mainly act as a tumor-suppressive agent.

In addition to serving as an immunoregulator, a number of cytokines have been considered as neuromodulators as well. Finely tuned cross-talk exists between the immune system and CNS. While the nervous system can modulate the immune response, the immune system is also capable of modulating the nervous system consistently via cytokine activity. More precisely, cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT pathway and their receptors are expressed in various brain cells. In order to maintain CNS homeostasis, both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines play significant roles. Different cytokines may result in activation of various sub-pathways associated with the JAK/STAT signaling. Given the significance of this pathway when the immunological responses and homeostasis are regulated in the nervous system, the alterations in JAK/STAT molecules and also the profile of numerous cytokines have implications in ASD.

The observed results are introductory, and additional in vitro and in vivo experiments could profoundly strengthen these findings.
