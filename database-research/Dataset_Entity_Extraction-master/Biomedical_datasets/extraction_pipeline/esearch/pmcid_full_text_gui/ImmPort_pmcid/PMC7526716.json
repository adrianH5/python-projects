Owing to its high heterogeneity, BRCA harbors a plethora of molecular subtypes, which lead to a variety of treatment therapies for BRCA. Hormone exposure is the major risk factor for BRCA, and estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are the most common endocrine markers involved in BRCA categorization. Based on the new definition of BRCA molecular subtypes issued by the 2013 St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference, BRCA can be classified into the following subtypes: luminal A (ER/PR+, HER2\u2013, Ki67+ < 20%), luminal B (ER/PR+ < 20%, HER2\u2013, Ki67+ \u2265 20%), HER2+B2 (ER/PR+ and HER2 overexpression), HER2 overexpression (ER\u2013, PR\u2013, and HER2 overexpression), basal-like TNBC (ER\u2013, PR\u2013, and HER2\u2013), and other subtypes. The treatment of BRCA is multidisciplinary and includes local surgery excision, radiation therapy, endocrine therapy, and other chemotherapies, such as anti-HER2 therapy. Consequently, the classification of BRCA subtypes before deciding on a treatment strategy is critical for BRCA patients. For patients with ER+ or PR+ BRCA, endocrine therapy is considered the most effective way to cure cancer. However, for patients with ER\u2013, PR\u2013, and HER2\u2013 BRCA, traditional endocrine therapy seems to lack efficacy. Thus, screening of the ER or PR state is usually the first step in the clinic toward choosing the treatment method for BRCA patients. In recent years, with the development and application of comprehensive therapies in the clinic, the overall survival (OS) rates for BRCA patients have increased, and the 5-year survival rates have improved to some extent (local stage, >96%; regional stage, >81%; distant stage, >26%). However, the prognosis of BRCA patients is primarily related to the molecular subtypes, and almost all patients who develop metastatic disease will succumb to it. Thus, it is important to search for novel prognostic biomarkers to predict the response rates to individual therapy of patients with different clinical characteristics or distinct molecular subtypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4152, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The immune system has been considered a determining factor during cancer initiation and progression. Emerging evidence suggests that the immune system plays a crucial role in the regulation of response to therapy and long-term outcomes of patients with BRCA. Furthermore, oncology and immunology are interwoven, especially in the selection of tumor therapy and prognosis prediction. Thus, the development of oncoimmunology has revealed that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are immune cells that infiltrate tumor tissues and increase the expression of immune-related genes, are closely related to the better survival of patients with specific subtypes of BRCA. TILs have been declared in various types of solid tumors, including BRCA, colon cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer, and lung cancer. Elevated levels of lymphocytic infiltrate were reported to be associated with HER2 amplification and portended long-term clinical outcomes. A strong linear relationship between the TIL number in patients with triple-negative breast cancer and the recurrence-free survival endpoints that increased over time has been reported. A previous study showed that high infiltration of lymphocytes in BRCA tissues might predict the response to neoadjuvant therapy and may also have a significant prognostic value after adjuvant chemotherapy. An increasing number of reports have confirmed that immune cells and immune-related genes have significant prognostic and predictive values. However, little is known about the genomic features driving high or low immune infiltration in BRCA; thus, it is of great value to better understand the interaction of BRCA and the immune system and to discover more potential immuno-oncological prognostic and predictive markers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5910, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Owing to technique limitations, an accurate assessment of TILs has not been achieved; for instance, tissue-based methods, including flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, cannot be applied to the high-throughput examination of multiple markers and large number of samples simultaneously. Progress in the field of single-cell genomes and transcriptomes has provided us with gene expression data to assess immune-related classifications and their associations with tumor cells. The development of bioinformatics techniques enables the integration of gene expression data into biological data; numerous emerging databases offer large-scale data with gene expression, clinical information, and biological characteristics; and various bioinformatics tools provide opportunities to merge different resources derived from different studies. For example, created the web resource database TIMER to evaluate the clinical impact of immune cells in diverse cancers. The ImmPort database was put in place to function as a critical repository for immunology-related clinical and molecular data. With all these approaches, researchers have begun to quantify TILs using the expression values of immune-related genes and identify individualized immune-related signatures in the tumor prognosis of various types of cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer, glioblastoma, and BRCA. identified eight genes (FOXO3, IL6, IL10, ZBTB16, CCL18, AIMP1, FCGR2B, and MMP9) with the highest prognostic value in glioblastoma using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. identified four immune-related genes (APOD, CXCL14, IL33, and LIFR) correlated with BRCA prognosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7555, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we focused on investigating the role of immune-related genes that are differentially expressed in BRCA tissues compared with healthy tissues and on exploring a model composed of immune-related genes to predict the prognosis of patients with BRCA.

To reveal the crucial mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of immune-related genes in BRCA, we constructed a transcriptional regulatory network of immune-related genes in BRCA. First, 318 tumor-related TFs were downloaded from the Cistrome Cancer database and were matched with the identified DEGs in BRCA (Supplementary Table 4). There were 80 tumor-related TFs among the DEGs (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figure 2B). To construct a model, we randomly classified the 1,013 BRCA samples in TCGA (96 samples were excluded owing to the lack of enough clinical information) into two groups: a training set (n = 508) and a testing set (n = 505). To discover which immune-related genes affected the prognosis of BRCA patients, we subjected the expression values of all 366 immune-related DEGs to a univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in the training set and identified 41 PIRDEGs that strongly correlated with patient OS (p < 0.05). Twenty of the 41 PIRDEGs were high-risk genes, and the other 21 PIRDEGs were low-risk genes for OS in BRCA patients (Figure 2C). All 41 PIRDEGs and 80 TFs among DEGs were used to construct the transcriptional regulatory network of PIRDEGs via Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis. To find strong correlations between TFs and PIRDEGs, we set the correlation analysis parameter filters as |correlation coefficient >0.4| and p < 0.001.

training set and testing set to validate the prognosis prediction ability of this model. The cutoff value of the risk score was the median risk score in the training set. On the basis of this parameter, we divided all samples in the training set and the testing set into high-risk groups or low-risk groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was performed. As expected, the high-risk group showed a poorer OS rate than the low-risk group in both the training set and testing set (Figures 5A,B). Next, we examined the predictive performance of this risk-score model for OS using ROC curves, and the results showed that the areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) in the training set and the testing set were 0.905 and 0.708, respectively (Figures 5C,D). The nomograms of this model in the training set and the testing set are shown in Figures 5E,F, respectively. We then ranked the risk scores of patients and analyzed the distribution of OS status of each patient in the training set and the testing set. As shown in Figures 6A,B, in the upper panel, the red dot plots indicate the high-risk patients, while the green dot plots indicate the low-risk patients; in the lower panel, the pink dot plots indicate patients who were dead, and the cyan dot plots indicate patients who were alive. It was clear that, in the lower panel, the number of pink dot plots increased with the rise of risk scores of patients. The bar plots show the expression pattern of risk genes in patients in the high- and low-risk groups (Figures 6C,D). We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to examine whether the immune gene signature was an independent prognostic factor in BRCA patients. We first analyzed the correlations between clinical factors, including age, gender, TNM stage, or risk scores, and OS of BRCA patients in the training group. In the univariate Cox analysis, age, TNM stage, and risk score were independent prognostic factors of BRCA patients (p < 0.05) (Figure 6E).

Investigators have reported the activation of immune-related genes in BRCA. An increasing number of studies have emphasized the significance of prognostic biomarkers in predicting cancer outcomes and recommended that more investigators include these biomarkers into therapeutic research. Several studies have suggested that immune-related genes can be used as prognostic biomarkers in BRCA. In the past years, most studies about immune-related prognostic biomarkers focused on TILs, and TILs have been identified as prognostic biomarkers in multiple malignancies. High infiltration of CD45RO+ (memory) and CD8+ (cytotoxic) TILs (used to calculate the immunoscore) was strongly related to the clinical outcomes of patients with lung, breast, colon, ovarian, prostate, and head and neck cancers. For instance, it has been reported that the densities and type of CD8+ TILs were correlated with tumor progression without interference from the tumor stage in colorectal cancer. Thus, the immunoscore was considered a valuable prognostic factor. The core of TILs is immune cells, and related studies have focused on the cell level. However, the definition of cell type, especially an immune cell type, is still dependent on molecular protein markers. Thus, we proposed as the original aim of our study to develop a series of immune-related biomarkers composed of immune genes rather than immune cells. In our study, to identify the molecular biomarkers in BRCA, we first identified the DEGs between BRCA and healthy tissues using public datasets from TCGA. Then, our study aimed to develop immune-related biomarkers; thus, the immune-related database ImmPort was used to identify the immune genes and help us obtain the IRDEGs in BRCA. PIRDEGs were selected using univariate Cox analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24713, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Transcription factors play a crucial role in controlling the expression of genes by binding to a particular DNA region, such as an enhancer or promoter. TFs were also found to be associated with the progression of glioblastoma. To construct a regulatory network of immune genes in BRCA, we selected 80 TFs from the DEGs in BRCA on the basis of information from the Cistrome database. Then, we constructed the regulatory network of TFs-PIRDEGs in BRCA on the basis of their correlations. As shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 6, we found four key TFs \u2013 EOMES, FOXP3, FLI1, and STAT1 \u2013 which had the most downstream PIRDEGs and relatively high correlation coefficients. Among the 41 PIRDEGs in this regulatory network, 21 PIRDEGs were the downstream genes of EOMES, and the correlation coefficient between EOMES and CXCR3 was up to 0.86. EOMES has been demonstrated to be involved in the differentiation of CD8+ T cells during the immune response by regulating the expression of lytic effector genes and to be an independent good prognostic factor for progression-free survival and OS, likely due to its association with a favorable immune signature in metastatic renal cell cancer patients. FOXP3 is an essential TF in maintaining immune system hemostasis by regulating Treg lineage function, and it has been described to be a strong prognostic factor for distant metastasis-free survival of BRCA patients. In the TF-PIRDEG network, we found many T-cell receptor-coding genes, including T-cell receptor beta variable and constant genes (TRBV5-6, TRBV28, TRBV18, TRBV12-3, and TRBC2).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26307, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We constructed a prognostic risk-score model using LASSO Cox regression analysis and obtained an immune gene signature to predict the OS of BRCA patients. As shown in Table 1, four low-risk IRDEGs and 11 high-risk IRDEGs constituted this risk-score model, and each patient was assigned a risk score based on this model. One of the immune genes in the signature and a high-risk factor in this model, FGF7, had the highest coefficient at 0.14. FGF7 is secreted by mesenchymal origin cells and acts as a paracrine cytokine targeting nearby cells via locally secreted signals, thus participating in immune reactions during tumor progression or inhibition. In urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract and bladder, FGF7 overexpression is an independent prognosticator. TSLP, TINAGL1, TNFRSF8, and PSME2 in this model exerted negative correlations with the OS of BRCA patients. TSLP is a member of cytokine resembling cytokine IL-7 and has recently been reported to be a regulator of type 2 inflammatory responses. The function of TSLP in various types of tumors is tumor context dependent, and its role in BRCA is also controversial. One study revealed that an IL-1\u03b2\u2013TSLP pathway could blunt antitumor immunity. In contrast, another study proposed its pro-tumor role with the evidence that the keratinocyte-specific overexpression of TSLP (in K14-TSLP transgenic mice) could inhibit the development of early BRCA. In our study, TSLP showed a protective effect on the OS of BRCA patients.

The efficacy of this model was verified in the training set and the testing set simultaneously, the OS rates of high- and low-risk-score groups of BRCA patients showed a significant difference, and the number of dead BRCA patients increased with the increase in risk scores of BRCA patients. Both univariate and multivariate Cox analyses revealed that the risk score derived from this model was an independent prognostic factor for BRCA patients. Early studies identified TILs in BRCA that mainly comprised CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and rare NK cells. In our study, we found that the risk scores showed negative correlations with the numbers of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and neutrophil cells. The prognostic value of TILs is somewhat debatable; for instance, in most human cancers, increased densities of CD3+, CD8+, and memory CD45RO+ T cells are associated with favorable prognosis. However, the prognostic value of these cells may be influenced by other immune cells residing in the same tumor. Hence, we may conclude that infiltrating immune cells as prognostic biomarkers in tumor patients are, to a large extent, dependent on the comprehensive assessment of various types of immune cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29405, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our study, we focused on the gene level rather than the cell level by screening PIRDEGs using bioinformatics analysis in BRCA, and the TF-PIRDEG network was used to identify crucial TFs in the regulation of the transcription level of immune-related genes in BRCA. A risk-score model consisting of immune genes was built, and the efficacy of this model was examined using extensive data from real samples. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors, such as age and sex, may introduce bias in the practical values of the identified genes. In addition, the data types and the random classification of the training group and test group may lead to different models. For instance, the public database TCGA offers researchers various data types, including raw gene counts, FPKM and FPKM-UQ. We used the FPKM files in our study, and the other two file types can also be used for analysis. In our study, we randomly evenly classified the TCGA samples into two groups, which is not the only way to categorize. We considered the different genes and prognostic models that may be found in other studies. Additionally, the different construction methods of the prognostic model and various algorithms that were used during the model construction may also lead to other models harboring equal or higher prediction value. Furthermore, our study was completely dependent on the reanalysis of public data, which was appropriate but lacked validation using clinical samples. We thought it would be more convincing if we added another test group using independent clinical samples, such as examination of the expression at the transcriptional level of the identified genes in our model using RT-PCR or Western blot.
