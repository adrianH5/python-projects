Research has reported that cigarette smoke induces oxidative stress, which damages biomacromolecules, leading to cell dysfunction or cell death. Moreover, oxidative stress also destroys the extracellular matrix, causing an imbalance of proteases and antiproteases and promoting the inflammatory response, ultimately leading to COPD. The airway and lung tissue of patients with COPD triggers continuous congenital and adaptive immune inflammatory responses in which neutrophils, macrophages, T lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells are involved in the pathogenesis. Infection, inflammation, cigarette smoke and immune injury products can induce lung autoimmunity, accelerating the pathogenesis of COPD. However, the specific immune pathway is still unclear. Traditional research methods for assessing immune cells in the past have included immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, both of which inevitably have limitations when it comes to fully analysing the composition of immune cells. In addition, flow cytometry may lead to cytolysis of certain cell types due to the high sample handling requirements. However, the immune response in tumours involves a large number of specific cell types. To better understand the diversity and nature of infiltrating immune cells in COPD, enumerating the number of immune cells in an aggregated fashion is a prerequisite. Cibersort is a general purpose gene expression based deconvolution algorithm that quantifies cellular components from the gene expression profile of a tissue. As a result, different types of infiltrating immune cells can be quantified simultaneously, allowing the method to avoid the concerns of various surface markers and cell separation. In this study, we identified differential immune cell infiltration between normal and COPD samples by using CIBERSORT. Based on this information, we determined the differential immune-related genes associated with differential immune cells as hub genes of COPD by correlation analysis. In addition, a logistic regression model was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of hub genes. Finally, we further explored the regulatory mechanism of transcription factors on hub genes. Therefore, the integrated analysis of immune cells and immune-related genes will help to identify diagnostic markers of COPD, thus contributing to the clinical treatment of COPD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5612, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Materials and Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5634, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Data Collection", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5650, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Matrix files of the GSE57148 dataset (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57148) based on the GPL11154 platform were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which contained 98 COPD and 91 normal individuals.

AHNAK is an exceptionally giant protein (700 kDa) that was initially identified in human neuroblastomas and skin epithelial cells and regulates cytoskeletal structure formation, muscle regeneration, calcium homeostasis, and signaling. AHNAK functions as a tumor suppressor in murine lungs by suppressing alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and modulating the lung microenvironment. In recent years, more attention has been given to the role of the AHNAK family in tumor progression. Upregulation of AHNAK was significantly associated with poor prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma, mesothelioma, and pancreatic ductal carcinoma. AHNAK is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer due to its ability to activate the TGFb signaling pathway. Using the powerful genome-wide linkage scan in a Dutch genetic isolate, Ivana et al confirmed the implication of the 15q25 region in COPD and identified regions at chromosomes 5 and 11. Within the region on chromosome 11, four deleterious rare variants in AHNAK, PLCB3, SLC22A11 and MTL5 were identified that were shared among most of the affected family members.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 21433, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SLIT2 is a secreted glycoprotein of the SLIT family that is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process that permits cancer cells to acquire migratory, invasive, and stem-like properties. A previous study reported that SLIT2 inhibited CXCL12/CXCR4-induced chemotaxis, invasion, adhesion of breast cancer cells and the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9. SLIT2 was downregulated in cigarette smoke-exposed cells and lung adenocarcinoma, and increased expression of SLIT2 was associated with a better outcome in lung adenocarcinoma patients. We also found that AHNAK and SLIT2 were negatively correlated with follicular helper T cells in the GSE57148 dataset of COPD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 22107, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our study, we found that TNFRRSF10C, CXCR1, CXCR2, and FCGR3B were positively correlated with neutrophils in COPD progression. CXCR1 and CXCR2 can promote neutrophil migration, and their chemokine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that bind to human IL-8 family chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL7 and CXCL8). CXCR1 and CXCR2 were observed on NK cells and lung structural cells, such as fibroblasts and epithelial and endothelial cells. An increasing number of studies have found that CXCR1 and CXCR2 play a role in the pathogenesis of certain pulmonary diseases, such as COPD, asthma, and lung fibrosis. Immunostaining for CXCR1 was observed in inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and, to a lesser extent, in fibroblasts within the bronchial submucosa. CXCR1 activates neutrophils and mediates neutrophil functions, including chemotaxis, intracellular calcium changes, phospholipase D activation, and respiratory burst, through the binding of specific ligands such as IL-8. CXCR1 expression in circulating neutrophil cells was significantly higher in COPD patients than in healthy subjects because the overexpression of CD-11b and CXCR1 in circulating neutrophils may be associated with the development of airflow limitation in COPD patients. The researchers found that the amount of smoking correlated only with CXCR1 expression in subjects who had a history of smoking (patients with COPD and smokers). Long-term exposure to smoking may play some role in the regulation of CXCR1. CXCR2, a G-protein-coupled receptor, binds human CXC chemokine ligands. CXCR2 is upregulated in exacerbations of COPD, where its expression colocalizes with the accumulation of airway mucosal neutrophils. Therefore, a study showed that the CXCR2 antagonist was effective in COPD. Blood neutrophil counts were associated with exacerbation frequency and mortality in COPD. IL-8 exerts its potential effects on neutrophils by binding with high affinity to the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 on its cell surface. Keir et al demonstrated that there was a subset of individuals with COPD in whom neutrophil activation was independent of CXCR2. Another study found that specific CXC chemokines resulted in enhanced migration of PBMCs/monocytes from patients with COPD, which was mediated via CXCR1 and CXCR2.
