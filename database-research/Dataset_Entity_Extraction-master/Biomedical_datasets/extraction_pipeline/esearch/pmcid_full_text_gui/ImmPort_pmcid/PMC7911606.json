Besides, the 5-year survival rate of advanced metastatic melanoma is approximately up to 10~15 percent due to its poor prognosis. As for the pathogenesis of melanoma, the exposure to ultraviolet rays is regarded as the most significant and probable environmental risk factor in cutaneous melanoma due to its effect of genotoxicity. The number of melanocytic nevi, family history, and hereditary susceptibility are also identified as the most indispensable host risk factors in cutaneous melanoma.

The immune system has been shown to be a determinative factor during cancer initiation and progression. Hence, immune-based therapy has recently approved the dramatical and innovative efficiency for the treatment of advanced and metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Various evidence has proved that cutaneous melanomas are immune-related tumors, and immunotherapy is vigorously pursued through targeting the immune checkpoints. Several of molecules have been described and were identified as potential targets in immunotherapy: the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4), the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), the programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), and the T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM3). The programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) are primarily expressed in the tumor microenvironment and can lead to inhibition of T cell stimulation after ligation to PD-1.

We explored the immune components analysis in the whole TCGA database.

We visualized the propensity score distributions between the high-risk group and the low-risk group (Figure 5(a)).

For instance, INHA was defined as a clinically key target in treating people with tuberculosis. NDRG1 played an indispensable role in myelination of the peripheral nervous system and was linked with the increasing rate of metastasis and death. IFITM1 was reported to participate in the signals of cell adhesion and antiproliferation transduction. And the overexpression of IFITM1 was confirmed to be correlated with the progressing of several cancers including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, oral cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia. GBP2 was found as a TGF-b target gene induced in metastatic breast cancer cells. CCL8 may enhance the ability of metastasis formation in melanomas as a chemoattractant. The local CCL8-rich environment could promote the selection of tumor cells with metastatic capacity, and the high CCL8 concentration inhibited the migration of tumor cells. There are few relevant works of literature reported involving in LHB, and the further research is needed. As a consequence, studies as mentioned above revealed the reasonability and accuracy of our six IAG signatures in cancer initiation and progression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24507, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The KM survival curves showed that high risk scores were related to poor OS in both the training set and the testing set.

Dramatic progression in survival outcomes has been revealed; with the therapy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the melanoma patients' median overall survival was more than 30 months.

Therefore, the accuracy and availability of our biomarker remained to be tested in other datasets, even in the prospective studies. Secondly, concerning the ICB immunotherapy, we might need more samples and more complete clinicopathological data to identify the robust relationship between our IAG signature and the immunotherapy. Finally, it was of great importance to conduct several functional experiments to clarify the roles of the six IAGs in melanoma.
