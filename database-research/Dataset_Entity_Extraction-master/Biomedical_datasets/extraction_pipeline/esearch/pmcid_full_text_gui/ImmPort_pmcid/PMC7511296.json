Samples in the current study were extracted from the ImmPort and TCGA databases to identify immune-related genes affecting GBM prognosis.

Among them, the 14 most representative genes showed a marked correlation with patient prognosis, and LASSO and stepwise regression analysis was carried out to further identify the genes for the construction of a predictive GBM prognosis model. Then, samples in training and test cohorts were incorporated into the model and divided to evaluate the efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the model to predict and classify the prognosis of patients and to identify the relevant immune features according to the median value of RiskScore (namely, Risk-H and Risk-L).

Methylation-based subtypes that predict GBM patient survival have been reported. Notably, the methylation levels of different subgroups could reflect different molecular genetic features. More and more attention has been paid to the relationship between the immune system and malignancy progression and pathogenesis, which contribute to GBM treatment, thereby promoting the development of anti-tumor treatments. CD68+ and CD163+ cells were the most abundant populations in GBM, and the percentage of CD163+ cells correlated with a poorer prognosis. Mesenchymal GBMs displayed the highest percentages of microglia, macrophage, and lymphocyte infiltration. Wild-type and the mesenchymal subtype, IDH1, in GBM presented strong immunosuppressive microenvironments, while tumors of mutated IDH1 and TCGA proneural subtypes exhibited a significantly less immunosuppressive state. Regarding tumor origin (namely, the immune system), the approach of regulating and killing cancer cells by modulating the immune system and promoting anti-cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment is novel. Therefore, screening of novel significant prognosis-specific immune-related genes is meaningful for predicting disease prognosis and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Some researchers have reported gene expression-based immunoprofiling of GBM using TCGA data. For example, Arivazhagan et al. reported a 14-gene expression signature that predicted survival in GBM patients. A network analysis specifically revealed inflammatory response pathway activation in the high-risk group. Zhang et al. showed that samples with high tumor microenvironment (TME) scores were characterized by immune activation, TGF pathway activation, and high expression of immune checkpoint genes, while those with low TME scores were characterized by a high-frequency of IDH1 and MET mutations. Zhang et al. identified six immune-related genes (CANX,\u00a0HSPA1B,\u00a0KLRC2,\u00a0PSMC6,\u00a0RFXAP, and\u00a0TAP1) as risk signatures. Importantly, Kaplan\u2013Meier and ROC curves, as well as risk plotting, verified their performance in TCGA and CGGA datasets.\u00a0Zhang et al. observed that a high immune score was associated with\u00a0low methylation and copy number variation levels, a high expression of immunosuppressive markers (CD27, PDL1 and CTLA4), and a shorter recurrence-free survival. Here, GBM classification based on the prognosis-specific and immune-related signature could precisely estimate the clinical outcomes and identify those with a high or low risk of postoperative recurrence. Notably, PD-L1 or PD-L2 IHC analysis results showed that the IHC score was positively correlated with the RiskScore.

Two key points must be cautiously taken into consideration to ensure the prognosis model validity: clinical utility and transport capability in different cohorts. Typically, our constructed prognosis model is better than other prognosis models for GBM that were not duplicated in GBM-independent cohorts. Additionally, our validation set was a multi-institutional cohort involving cases from different hospitals, which suggests that our constructed GBM model is applicable to different clinical settings and patient types. Afterwards, the 14-gene-based model was constructed for prognosis prediction, and RiskScore values for all cases were also computed. Then, the model was applied for prediction and validation.

They were markedly correlated with patient survival and prognosis, which means that our bioinformatic mining displayed a high reliability and accuracy. However, the relationship of the other two genes (namely, CLRF1 and GRAP2) with GBM is not validated in a clinical or basic study, and we are interested in this topic. CRLF1 is verified to be involved in regulating malignant cancer cell proliferation and invasion, which can affect signaling pathways (such as MAPK/ERK and Akt/PI3K) and modulate the immune and nervous systems maturity during fetal development.
