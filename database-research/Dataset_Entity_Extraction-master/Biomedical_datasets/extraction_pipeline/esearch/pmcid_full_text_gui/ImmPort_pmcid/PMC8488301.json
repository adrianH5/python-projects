In this study, bioinformatics analysis of immune-related genes of hepatocellular carcinoma was used to construct a multi-gene combined marker that can predict the prognosis of patients. The RNA expression data of hepatocellular carcinoma were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and immune-related genes were obtained from the IMMPORT database. Differential analysis was performed by Wilcox test to obtain differentially expressed genes. Univariate Cox regression analysis, lasso regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to establish a prognostic model of immune genes, a total of 5 genes (HDAC1, BIRC5, SPP1, STC2, NR6A1) were identified to construct the models. The expression levels of 5 genes in HCC tissues were significantly different from those in paracancerous tissues. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the risk score calculated according to the prognostic model was significantly related to the overall survival (OS) of HCC. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve confirmed that the prognostic model had high accuracy. Independent prognostic analysis was performed to prove that the risk value can be used as an independent prognostic factor. Then, the gene expression data of hepatocellular carcinoma in the ICGC database was used as a validation data set for the verification of the above steps. In addition, we used the CIBERSORT software and TIMER database to conduct immune infiltration research, and the results showed that the five genes of the model and the risk score have a certain correlation with the content of immune cells. Moreover, through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and the construction of protein interaction networks, we found that the p53-mediated signal transduction pathway is a potentially important signal pathway for hepatocellular carcinoma and is positively regulated by certain genes in the prognostic model. In conclusion, this study provides potential targets for predicting the prognosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and also provides new ideas about the correlation between immune genes and potential pathways of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2458, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2471, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Liver cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide and is the only one of the top five deadliest cancers to have an annual percentage increase in occurrence.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common liver cancer, accounts for 80% of all liver cancer cases, is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Because of the high heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma, there is an urgent need for biomarkers that can predict the prognosis of patients. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Glypican-3 (GPC3) and other indicators were considered to indicate the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, but because of the complex molecular mechanism and strong heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma, these indicators still have some limitations.

The results showed that the risk score was still significantly correlated with OS and can be used as an independent prognostic factor (Figures\u00a06C, D).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21644, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "The Correlation Between Prognostic Models and Immune Cells", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21703, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Download the immune cell content files of TCGA database samples from the TIMER database, including six types of immune cells: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

Due to the high degree of heterogeneity of liver cancer, conventional indicators such as TMN staging, age and gender are slightly insufficient in predicting the prognosis of liver cancer patients. Anwanwan et\u00a0al. reported that patients are often diagnosed with liver cancer in advanced stages, contributing to its poor prognosis. Of all liver cancer cases, 80% are hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Most patients with HCC are diagnosed by surveillance or incidental imaging analysis.

Besides the protection against pathogens, it is strongly involved in cancer prevention, development and defense. The immune system has been shown to be a decisive factor in the occurrence and development of cancer. A variety of immune cells and immune-related molecules have been proved to be related to tumorigenesis, proliferation and development, for example, Yi L, Sun D, Han Q et\u00a0al. found that interferon regulatory factor 3 can mediate the innate immune response and apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer induced by Poly. Studying the role of immunity in tumors is of great significance, and immune-related genes are important research content. Some studies have found that immune genes are related to various biological behaviors such as tumor development, metastasis, and apoptosis. At present, the gene signal based on abnormal mRNA has been used to predict the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, which has great potential. Gene signatures based on immune-related genes have been reported in a variety of cancers, such as lung squamous cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal carcinoma, etc. In this study, the high-throughput expression profiles of immune-related genes in TCGA-LIHC cohort were analyzed, and the differentially expressed immune genes were screened by differential analysis. After univariate cox regression analysis, lasso analysis and multivariate cox analysis, a five-gene signature (including HDAC1, BIRC5, SPP1, STC2, NR6A1) was constructed to predict the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The high expression of five genes was related to the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Calculate the patient\u2019s risk values based on the relative expression levels of the five genes, and divide the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the risk value. The results of survival analysis showed that the survival prognosis of patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse than that in the low-risk group. The AUC value of the ROC curve of the prognostic model was 0.764, indicating that the risk score prognostic model has a good predictive ability for survival prognosis. Univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis confirmed that the risk value based on this prognostic model can be used as an independent prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, in the independent hepatocellular carcinoma data set of the ICGC database, we conducted external verification of the prognosis model, and the predictive ability of the five-gene signature in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was further confirmed, and the expression levels of the five genes were verified.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35029, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Yamashita et\u00a0al. reported that the immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) play important roles in tumorigenesis.

On the one hand, our study confirmed that the risk score based on the prognostic model has a significant correlation with the six immune cells through the TIMER database.

The results of bioenrichment analysis of TCGA-LIHC cohort samples showed that 261 genes were enriched in the signal transduction pathway of P53 mediators. P53 is an important tumor suppressor gene, the P53-mediated cell signal transduction pathway plays an important role in regulating the normal life activities of cells, and its connection with other signal transduction pathways in the cell is very complicated. P53 mutation can play a protective role in inflammation and cancer. P53 plays an important regulatory role in blocking the cell cycle, promoting cell apoptosis, maintaining genome stability, and inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. The genes present in the signal transduction pathway of P53 mediators constitute a huge regulatory network, and some genes control the biological functions of a large number of related proteins. Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela et\u00a0al. have found that some genes in p53 pathway can participate in the process of immune regulation and play a role in the occurrence and development of tumors. In order to explore the potential relationship between these genes and prognostic-related immune genes, we conducted a correlation analysis of the two and constructed a regulatory network based on the results. From the network diagram, it can be seen that many genes in the signal transduction pathway of P53 mediators have a positive regulation relationship with some prognostic-related immune genes (HDAC1 BIRC5, NR6A1, PSMD2, CDK4, ISG20L2, NDRG1).
