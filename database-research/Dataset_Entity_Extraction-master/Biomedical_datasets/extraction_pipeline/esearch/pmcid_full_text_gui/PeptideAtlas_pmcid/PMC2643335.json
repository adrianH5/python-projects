First we investigated whether mRNA and protein abundance were indeed proportional. The dynamic quantitative relationships between transcription and translation can be assessed at the level of absolute abundance or relative changes in the outputs of mRNA and protein.

In addition, we found that this relationship is not biased by protein length (Supplemental Fig. SF-2). Further, from our analysis we found that for lower abundance transcripts there is a dramatic increase in proteome coverage with small increases in mRNA signal intensity (Fig. 3C). This may be attributable to the observation that a significant fraction of the transcriptome (>60%) in H. salinarum NRC-1 appears to be present in low abundance (300\u22121500 intensity units) (Fig. 3C).

However, the selection of proteotypic peptides for practical applications is more complicated since the PA represents a diverse array of experimental techniques (ICAT, iTRAQ, immunoprecipitation, etc.) designed to address different scientific problems. Each of these approaches could have an inherent bias in peptide detection as suggested by the observation that a majority of proteins were observed in a small number of runs; for example, 633 (43%) of the 1,461 observed non-redundant proteins were observed in 5 or fewer of the 497 runs (Fig. 4). We conducted a comparative analysis to determine possible biases and efficiencies of peptide detection by each individual approach. We caution that such a comparison can be confounded by the significant biases in protein and peptide populations that were intentionally enriched in several of these approaches. For example, there was very little overlap between cysteine-specific ICAT labeling approach and any other proteomics method (Fig. 5).

Specifically, we considered proteotypic peptides for 25 proteins that were observed in the largest number of LCMS runs in iTRAQ experiments vs. all other approaches (data for two proteins are shown in Table 5, the remaining 25 proteins is given in Supplemental Table ST-3). Notably, of the 180 proteotypic peptides for these 25 proteins, only 40 were detected reliably by both approaches. A likely explanation is that iTRAQ introduces a significant bias in the types of peptides that are detected. Therefore, the choice of an appropriate proteotypic peptide will clearly vary depending on the application. Until we have a clearer understanding for the reasons for these observed biases, an empirical approach remains the best option for proteotypic peptide selection. For example, searching for the glutamate dehydrogenase protein GdhB in the H. salinarum NRC-1 PA yields 26 distinct peptides, which were detected a total of 208 times. Of these, the peptide CAVMDLPFGGAK (PA accession: PAp00363211) has an Empirical Observability Score (EOS) score of 0.59, indicating it was detected reliably. Further investigation into this peptide reveals that it was detected in both iTRAQ and ICAT experiments a total of 57 times and is therefore a reliable candidate for future use as a proteotypic peptide for both of these experimental approaches. However, this peptide was not detected in any of the experiments for targeted enrichment of transcription factors. A second peptide, VVQVSVPVER (PAp00368363) with a lower EOS score of 0.41, on the other hand, was detected only 12 times but observed in at least three of the targeted enrichment experiments. Clearly, this second peptide would make for a better proteotypic peptide for these targeted enrichment applications. Using this approach, one can compile a custom list of proteotypic peptides for a specific application of interest.

Note that the first three bins are empty (i.e. transcripts with low intensities were detected neither at the mRNA nor at the protein level). Cumulative proteome coverage (black connected squares; right-hand Y-axis) was calculated by adding the total number of proteins detected per transcript intensity bin as each successively higher bin was added to the analysis. Note that although the analysis was carried out to intensities of 50,000, for brevity we have terminated the graph at 10,000 on the X-axis and 60% cumulative coverage on the right-hand Y-axis , since we observed an increase of new detections of only \u223c3% between intensities of 10,000 and 50,000.
