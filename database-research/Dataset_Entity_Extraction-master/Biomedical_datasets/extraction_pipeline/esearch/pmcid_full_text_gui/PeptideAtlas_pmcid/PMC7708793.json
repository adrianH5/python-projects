However, its underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. The present work built a monocular form-deprivation myopia (FDM) guinea pig model, using facemasks as well as atropine treatment on FDM eyes for 2 and 4 weeks. Retinal protein changes in response to the FDM and effects of topical administration of atropine were screened for the two periods using fractionated isobaric tags for a relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) approach coupled with nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC\u2013MS/MS) (n=24, 48 eyes). Retinal tissues from another cohort receiving 4-weeks FDM with atropine treatment (n=12, 24 eyes) with more significant changes were subjected to sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) proteomics for further protein target confirmation. A total of 1695 proteins (8875 peptides) and 5961 proteins (51871 peptides) were identified using iTRAQ and SWATH approaches, respectively. Using the Paragon algorithm in the ProteinPilotTM software, the three most significantly up-regulated and down-regulated proteins that were commonly found in both ITRAQ and SWATH experiments are presented.
