Utilizing a systems approach, a fundamental understanding of genetic and environmental factors influencing health, growth, nutrition, behaviour and fertility provides an essential platform for improving industrial farm animal production methods. Moreover, the domestic pig is an important model organism for human biomedical research, due to the close similarity on the gene and proteome level between pig and humans. As a model organism, the pig is still a newcomer, partly because the pig genome was just recently published , but the diversity of available pig models is rapidly expanding. In particular for research in nutrition, inflammation and host-microbial cross-talk, pig models present unmatched modeling opportunities , because the pig, like human, is an omnivore, with very similar nutritional requirements, digestive- and immune system and gut microbial components. Current nutrigenomic research aims to characterize complex relational networks between animal genomics, nutrition and gut microbes (metagenomics), which impact health, growth and metabolism of the individual animal. Such system-wide understanding is equally important for managing animal health in industrial pig production, as it is for facing the increasing global challenges to human health caused by e.g. malnutrition and food pathogens.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2964, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A key component to complex network analysis is readily available resources of multi-scalar data, of which proteomics plays a key role.

The SRM approach is now widely used for the study of complex tissue samples and body fluids. For pig, a PeptideAtlas repository covering 2484 canonical proteins has been available since 2009. With the recent expansion of pig proteome research, we have for the first time the opportunity to collect data across parallel projects and laboratories. This resulted in a significantly improved coverage of pig protein information, now collected in the PeptideAtlas. Here, we present the contents of the current Pig PeptideAtlas, including data from 25 tissues and three body fluid types mapped to 7139 canonical proteins. The content of the Pig PeptideAtlas reflects actively ongoing research within the veterinary proteomics domain, and covers extensively muscle, liver, gut and neural proteomes, as well as several body fluids relevant for diagnostic purposes.

The representation of these central protein pathways in the Pig PeptideAtlas provides a resource for detecting an array of proteins playing significant roles in animal health under industrial farming systems, but also supporting a further development of pig models with relevance to human health research. The aim of the current paper is to illustrate how the Pig PeptideAtlas can be used to mine sequence specific information about proteins of particular interest.

Also, previous studies of SAA in pigs have suggested the expression of a mammary-specific SAA isoform [, ]. Our observations across the pig PeptideAtlas clearly suggest a local secretion of an SAA3 isoform to the colostrum and not found in other tissues. However, in the PeptideAtlas, only a single unique peptide identifies the SAA3 isoform, thus, our observations may also reflect that specific SAA3 fragments, or modifications of SAA3 may be present in the colostrum.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23020, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This observation is interesting in the light that the pig mammary gland related SAA isoform has been observed to increase during pregnancy, peaking at day 15 of lactation. Also, a specific peptide from SAA3 (DMREANYKNSDKYFHARGNYDAA) was found to act as a chemo-attractant for immune cells, indicating that the mammary-associated isoform of SAA3 may have an important biological role in host response against pathogens, both in the mammary gland as well as in the gut of the young piglet upon uptake of milk and colostrum proteins. Also in human milk, the role of SAA3 has been related to host response to pathogens. Moreover, we have also previously observed bovine SAA3, expressed by mammary epithelial cells, and increased in abundance both in milk and mammary gland tissues after bacterial lipopolysaccharide or Streptococcus uberis challenge.

Current pig models are available for monitoring pig gut inflammatory conditions, and these models have recently gained increasing relevance for modeling human conditions, because pig models offer an unmatched close similarity to human digestion tract, and offer access to samples that are very hard to obtain from human patients.

However, one of the purposes of the Pig PeptideAtlas is to make it possible for a wide range of users to study these proteins, to support progress of clinically relevant markers which can be used to monitoring health and disease in pigs. For diagnosing gut inflammation in the human clinic, stool samples are preferred over serum and tissue samples, partly due to its non-invasive and continuous sampling opportunity, and also for its direct contact with the inflamed area.

However, elevated levels of calprotectin in stool is not a unique marker for inflamed gut tissues, as it has also been associated with other clinical conditions, including the presence of polyps, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and normal ageing . Lactotransferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein expressed by activated neutrophils, is released upon tissue damage, where it contributes to modulate the inflammatory response, and as a part of the innate immune system delivers a first line defense against pathogens.
