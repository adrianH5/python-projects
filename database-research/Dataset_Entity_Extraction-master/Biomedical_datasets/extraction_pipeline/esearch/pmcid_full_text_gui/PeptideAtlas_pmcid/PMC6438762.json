Reliable mapping of peptides to proteins still poses substantial challenges when considering similar proteins, protein families, splice isoforms, sequence variation, and possible residue mass modifications, combined with an imperfect and incomplete understanding of the proteome. The ProteoMapper tool enables a comprehensive and rapid mapping of peptides to a reference proteome. The indexer component creates a segmented index for an input proteome from a FASTA or PEFF file. The ProMaST component provides ultra-fast mapping of one or more input peptides against the index. ProteoMapper allows searches that take into account known sequence variation encoded in PEFF files. It also enables fuzzy searches to find highly similar peptides with residue order changes or other isobaric or near-isobaric substitutions within a specified mass tolerance. We demonstrate an example of a one-hit-wonder identification in PeptideAtlas that may be better explained by a combination of catalogued and uncatalogued sequence variation in another highly observed protein.

In typical workflows, proteins extracted from a sample are digested with trypsin, fractionated by liquid chromatography, ionized, and introduced into a mass spectrometer for analysis. After measuring the intact mass-to-charge ratio of the charged peptide precursors, the instrument fragments these by methods such as collisional dissociation and records the resultant product ion mass spectra generated. Current instrumentation collects millions of fragment ion spectra generated per experiment which are then subjected to computational analysis to identify the peptidoforms present in the sample and quantify their abundances.

Approximately 90% of peptides in the Human PeptideAtlas map uniquely to one gene and are generally termed uniquely mapping peptides. However, there remain a substantial number of complications. For example, one gene often yields multiple splice isoforms, several of which may be present in a sample; distinguishing which of several isoforms are present may or may not be important for a particular experiment. In addition, many different genes and their proteins have sequences similar enough that some peptides map to multiple proteins, both among genes related to each other in a family as well as due to short repeated motifs among unrelated proteins. An often-overlooked complication is that for many species there is a tremendous amount of genetic variation, a fraction of which will yield changes in protein sequence. Indeed our overall understanding of the proteome of a species or an individual continues to change. The shorter the peptide, the greater the chance that it will map to multiple proteins, and is often termed a multiply mapping peptide. The result of this ambiguity results in additional uncertainty in the identification of proteins, which must be modeled in combination with the uncertainty of peptide identifications.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4233, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The international Human Proteome Project (HPP) of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) has defined one of its primary goals as advancing our understanding of the many aspects that comprise the human proteome, including a more complete understanding of the protein \u201cparts list\u201d, the full complement of splice isoforms, functions, sequence variations, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) for each protein. The knowledge being generated as part of the concerted effort of the international community of biomedical research, both within the HPP and external to it, is being assembled into the neXtProt knowledge base, which itself derives from UniProtKB. A part of this effort is to classify protein entries in terms of the evidence for their bona fide translation into a protein in vivo. The protein evidence (PE) score denotes PE=1 for proteins with high confidence evidence of translation, PE=2 for evidence of transcription (but not yet translation), PE=3 for orthologs of predicted proteins in other species, and PE=4 for solid predictions but no other evidence. PE=5 is reserved for entries that are likely to be pseudogenes and are not translated, but there remains some past questionable translation evidence that hinders their deletion from the proteome; a few may be real proteins and await better evidence before an upgrade to PE=1. The HPP has defined PE=2\u20134 proteins as \u201cmissing proteins\u201d (MPs), a set for which solid translation evidence is being actively sought in order to upgrade them to PE=1 or delete them from the proteome, as appropriate. As of neXtProt version 2018\u201301, there remain only 2186 missing proteins, a mere 10% of the expected entire human proteome based on the agreed identification of open reading frames resulting in gene calls. However, gathering the necessary evidence for these MPs is becoming progressively harder as most of these proteins are low-abundance, highly tissue specific, and/or membrane-bound proteins, and are therefore difficult to isolate, detect and identify via current mass spectrometry workflows. The HPP has written a set of mass spectrometry data interpretation guidelines to aid in the analysis and presentation of mass spectrometry data that purport to provide evidence for these MPs or other translation products not even in the current neXtProt proteome. One of these guidelines requests that a high confidence peptide that appears to map uniquely to a MP be carefully checked to determine if a mapping to a commonly detected PE=1 protein with a type of variation that is not trivially accounted for is possible.

All discovered segments are written in alphabetical order to the index file along with a listing of all proteins and locations to which the segments map. The user may select the desired segment size. The longer the segment size, the more entries there are in the index, albeit with few protein mappings per segment. For example with a segment size of two with 20 amino acids, there would only be 400 entries in the index (AA, AC, AD, etc.), but each segment would map to nearly every protein. At a segment size of 10, there are 20^10 entries, albeit with most entries containing no matches. Figure 2 plots the overall size of the index, the time to build the index, and the time required to search a uniform test set of peptides against each index of segment sizes ranging from 3 to 6, both for the human proteome without variants and for the neXtProt human proteome with all SAAVs considered.

First, all input peptides are decomposed into an approximately minimal set of segments of the same segment size used for the reference input index. Two segments for a peptide may overlap if the peptide is not a multiple of the segment size. For example, an input peptide of PEPTIDER would decompose to PEPTI and TIDER for an index size of five.

A 2-wildcard search scans the index for all instances of the 1-wildcard case plus XXPTIDER, XEXTIDER, XEPXIDER, etc. ProMaST supports up to three wildcards per peptide, although with three wildcards, they are only considered as a consecutive group.

The indexer takes as input a FASTA or PEFF file and creates a segmented index. The mapper takes as input one or more peptides as a list or a pepXML file, a previously created index, and other optional parameters. It then provides its output in pepXML, TSV, JSON, or HTML.
