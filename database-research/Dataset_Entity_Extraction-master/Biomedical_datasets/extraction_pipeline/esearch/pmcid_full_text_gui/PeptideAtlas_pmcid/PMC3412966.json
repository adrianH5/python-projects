Recently, we presented a novel platform that we termed global proteome survey, where we combined the best features of affinity proteomics and mass spectrometry, to probe any proteome in a species independent manner while still using a limited set of antibodies. We used so called context-independent-motif-specific antibodies, directed against short amino acid motifs. This enabled enrichment of motif-containing peptides from a digested proteome, which then were detected and identified by mass spectrometry. In this study, we have demonstrated the quantitative capability, reproducibility, sensitivity, and coverage of the global proteome survey technology by targeting stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-labeled yeast cultures cultivated in glucose or ethanol. The data showed that a wide range of motif-containing peptides (proteins) could be detected, identified, and quantified in a highly reproducible manner. On average, each of six different motif-specific antibodies was found to target about 75 different motif-containing proteins. Furthermore, peptides originating from proteins spanning in abundance from over a million down to less than 50 copies per cell, could be targeted. It is worth noting that a significant set of peptides previously not reported in the PeptideAtlas database was among the profiled targets. The quantitative data corroborated well with the corresponding data generated after conventional strong cation exchange fractionation of the same samples. Finally, several differentially expressed proteins, with both known and unknown functions, many relevant for the central carbon metabolism, could be detected in the glucose- versus ethanol-cultivated yeast. Taken together, the study demonstrated the potential of our immunoaffinity-based mass spectrometry platform for reproducible quantitative proteomics targeting classes of motif-containing peptides.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2171, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the quest for disease-associated biomarkers, the deciphering of the human proteome(s) will be central. Albeit powerful mass spectrometry (MS)-based technology platforms have been developed and frequently applied, the output in terms of validated biomarkers have so far been limited, mainly due to technological issues. In recent years, affinity proteomics based on antibody microarrays have become an established proteomic technology for protein expression profiling of complex proteomes. To date, the technology has been applied in several clinical applications, demonstrating its potential for, e.g. biomarker discovery, improved diagnosis and prognosis, as well as classification. Despite the success, the possibility to run large-scale and, in particular, discovery mode projects using the conventional antibody array designs have been limited. First, antibodies of only known specificities, i.e. directed against preselected targets of a known specie, have been included, thereby excluding the possibility to discover novel targets (across species). Second, the resolution of an antibody array is directly related to the sheer number of antibodies included and their range of specificities, which tends to be a bottleneck. Third, the numbers of readily available antibodies, designed for microarray applications, have per se been limited.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3518, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To bypass these technological hurdles and advance further, and even to provide quantitative capabilities, the most attractive features of affinity proteomics and MS could be combined. The biological sample would then be digested and exposed to peptide-specific antibodies, after which any specifically enriched peptides would be detected, identified, and potentially quantified using MS. This was demonstrated in the stable isotope standard capture with antipeptide antibodies set-up, but, like conventional antibody arrays, this platform relied on the use of one binder per unique peptide/protein. To circumvent the need of having to generate numerous antibodies, we and others, have recently presented the novel concept of using antibodies directed against short peptide-motifs (epitopes) shared among up to hundreds of different peptides/proteins. This would provide an inherent capability of probing any proteome in a discovery mode, in a species independent manner, while still using a very limited number of antibodies. Based on this concept, we have recently designed a platform denoted global proteome survey (GPS)1, based on human recombinant single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies, while Joos et al. presented the triple X proteomic (TXP) set-up, relying on polyclonal and/or monoclonal antibodies. In our case, the scFv antibodies, microarray adapted by molecular design, were derived from a large phage-display library, representing a renewable probe source displaying an extensive range of specificities. In this manner, one hundred of such scFv antibodies, denoted context-independent motif specific (CIMS) antibodies, could theoretically cover almost 50% of the nonredundant human proteome, a concept supported by a recent in-silico motif study of the human proteome. Recently, we demonstrated experimental proof-of-principle for that a limited number of CIMS antibodies could be used to profile crude, digested proteomes when combined with a mass spectrometry-based read-out. The GPS platform was in fact shown to provide novel and broad coverage, and to have the potential to reach deep into a proteome in a species independent manner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5681, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we have demonstrated the GPS set-up with respect to its quantitative capability, reproducibility, sensitivity, and coverage, by using the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach, targeting SILAC-labeled yeast cultivated in either glucose or ethanol.

A common solution to this matter has been extensive conventional prefractionation prior to LC-MS-MS, but this approach, which might also introduce other issues (e.g. logistics, yield, and reproducibility), is not practical when large sample cohorts are to be addressed. In addition, the instrument time is frequently suboptimally used because of repetitive sampling of peptides from high-abundant proteins. In the case of GPS, the latter two issues could, if so required, be even bypassed, by (1) optimizing the capture step by designing the motifs so that few or no high-abundant motif-carrying peptides are targeted, and (2) optimizing the assay step by multiplexing, i.e. using \u22652 CIMS antibodies at the same time.

In this context, our recombinant scFv antibody library does not only represent a vast, renewable probe source, but could also provide unique opportunities in generating antibodies against peptides displaying low or even no immunogenicity. In addition, the proteome coverage could potentially also be extended by changing the specificity of the digesting enzyme employed and generating a new set of C-terminal motif specific CIMS antibodies.
