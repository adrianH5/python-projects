This is achieved by the sequential selection of precursor ions and the recording of their fragment ion spectra in a mass spectrometer, followed by computational analysis of the acquired spectra. The PeptideAtlas project was initiated in 2002 to create a compendium of high quality peptide identifications and their associated fragment ion spectra from shotgun proteomics experiments submitted by laboratories around the world. The PeptideAtlas project collects raw shotgun proteomics data files from the community and processes them via a uniform computational pipeline, the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) to ensure a consistent, well understood and low false discovery rate.

The technique is therefore particularly suited for the consistent quantification of pre-determined protein sets as is the case in many clinical and systems biology studies. A typical SRM workflow begins with the selection of a set of peptides that optimally and uniquely represents the set of target proteins, and the transitions that identify these peptides. A transition is a pair of m/z values, one for the precursor ion of the targeted peptide and one for one of its fragment ions. Typically, peptides are selected for detectability and uniqueness to a specific protein, and three to ten transitions are selected per peptide, forming a transition group that conclusively identifies the targeted peptide and by inference the protein. Known amounts of matching, isotopically-labeled peptides may be spiked into the sample to provide accurate quantification and aid the identification. The instrument is then programmed to monitor only the specified transitions, either over the entire time course, or restricted to specific elution time windows (scheduled SRM).

Several peak groups may appear in a single trace group; part of the analysis is to determine which, if any, represents detection of the peptide of interest. See Figure 3 for an illustration of these concepts. Traces and trace groups can be visualized and analyzed using various software tools that assess the likelihood that the peptide was actually observed and calculate its relative or absolute abundance, such as ATAQS, AuDIT, mProphet, MRMaid, MRMer, Skyline, and TIQAM.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4677, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Features have been added to PeptideAtlas to leverage shotgun data in support of SRM experiment design.
