Once the peptides were eluted and ionized, they were analyzed in the QQQ-MS, operated in the SRM mode, as described in. To maintain high sensitivity of the SRM measurements, the selected targets were divided to three different transition lists and scheduled assays with a 5\u00a0min retention time window for each peptide was applied, resulting in a cycle time of 2.5\u00a0s and a dwell time of >20\u00a0ms. The protein targets and the respective SRM assay parameters were selected from the public dataset, available in Panorama Public (https://panoramaweb.org/labkey/Vuorijoki_et_al_2015.url). For the quantification of six proteins (encoded by sll0542, sll1031, sll1525, slr1963, slr2067, slr2136), a different set of 2\u20133 proteotypic peptides were selected, due to more stable signals between the replicates. The indexed retention times (iRT-values) for these peptides are listed in Table 1. The data was analyzed and refined in Skyline and the generated MSstats input file (Table 2) was processed with MSstats 3.1.4. A global standard normalization was used for the data with two endogenous peptides (SNLDSNHIIYR and SEELLGAASNR) of the probable DNA-directed RNA polymerase omega subunit (ssl2982). The data was processed with MSstats by using restricted scope of conclusions to the three replicates. The experimental design was based on MSstats implemented Group Comparison tool.
