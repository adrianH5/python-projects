It is culture independent, requires no a priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide useful genomic information. However, MSS can lack sensitivity and may yield insufficient data for detailed analysis. We have created a targeted sequence capture panel, ViroCap, designed to enrich nucleic acid from DNA and RNA viruses from 34 families that infect vertebrate hosts. A computational approach condensed \u223c1 billion bp of viral reference sequence into <200 million bp of unique, representative sequence suitable for targeted sequence capture. We compared the effectiveness of detecting viruses in standard MSS versus MSS following targeted sequence capture. First, we analyzed two sets of samples, one derived from samples submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and one derived from samples collected in a study of fever in children. We detected 14 and 18 viruses in the two sets, comprising 19 genera from 10 families, with dramatic enhancement of genome representation following capture enrichment. The median fold-increases in percentage viral reads post-capture were 674 and 296. Median breadth of coverage increased from 2.1% to 83.2% post-capture in the first set and from 2.0% to 75.6% in the second set. Next, we analyzed samples containing a set of diverse anellovirus sequences and demonstrated that ViroCap could be used to detect viral sequences with up to 58% variation from the references used to select capture probes.

Thus far, most microbiome studies have focused on bacteria, although some include fungi and viruses. Viruses are particularly understudied, in part due to the challenges of assessing their presence in clinical samples. Viruses as a group have highly variable genomes, with no gene shared among all viruses that can be surveyed by an amplicon-based sequencing strategy. Therefore, studies of viruses based on nucleotide sequencing require a metagenomic approach. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is a relatively unbiased, culture-independent method in which nucleic acid extracted from a sample is sequenced. Sequence reads are classified based on similarity to reference genomes. This approach allows comprehensive study of the viral component of the microbiome (the virome) and has led to the discovery of novel viruses (for review, see) and the characterization of viruses present in healthy and sick people.

This can be a particular problem for studies of the virome of healthy, asymptomatic individuals, in whom virus levels may be low. In efforts to increase the sequence yield, purification or enrichment procedures have been employed, including low-speed centrifugation and/or filtration to remove bacterial and host cells, sample treatment with nucleases to digest nucleic acid not protected within virions, or concentration of viral particles by high-speed gradient centrifugation (for review, see).

First, as we demonstrate, MSS with ViroCap can be used to generate complete or nearly complete genome sequences directly from clinical samples, including those with very low proportions of viral nucleic acid, without culturing the viruses. Availability of extensive sequence data provides the opportunity to distinguish among closely related virus subtypes or even among viral strains, which might not be distinguished by other types of assays. In the data set presented here, we demonstrated the ability to type rhinoviruses and distinguish between human herpesvirus 6B and 6A, adenovirus types A and C, and polyomaviruses JC and BK. Notably, influenza A virus was identified precapture but could only be typed as an H3N2 virus post-capture. Elsewhere, we used ViroCap to sequence the enterovirus D68 genome directly from clinical samples, and in that work, the extensive sequence data that we obtained allowed us carry out detailed comparative analysis of closely related strains that differed at a limited number of nucleotide positions. Second, the use of ViroCap can reduce the depth of sequencing needed to detect viruses in samples. Because targeted sequence capture results in a large increase in the percentage of sequencing reads that are viral (Tables 1, 2; Fig. 2; Supplemental Tables S2\u2013S4), ViroCap achieves better viral coverage while requiring the generation of fewer total sequence reads.

As our SeqCap EZ targeted sequence capture probe lengths are 100 bp, the sequences generated by the sliding window algorithm represent the total number of possible probe combinations based on the aggregate of Genome Neighbor sequences.

This is 17 times the size of our viral RefSeq selections and three times the size of our collapsed Genome Neighbor targets. Our selected RefSeq sequences included 29 influenza RefSeq entries (each influenza virus segment is represented as a separate entry), targeted in its entirety. These sequences served as the core of influenza reference genomes against which all other influenza sequences were compared. We directly clustered the long influenza sequences using length-sorted FASTA and the UCLUST package (version 1.1.579; parameters: \u2013rev \u2013id 0.90). In UCLUST, a cluster is defined by one sequence, known as the centroid or representative sequence. To lessen the computational burden and ensure that our core influenza RefSeq genomes were always the longest first seeds (centroids) in UCLUST's clustering process, we artificially concatenated the 29 parent RefSeq sequences into one linear sequence representation and then split this representation into six segments ranging in size from 18\u201326 kb. UCLUST preferentially seeded with the long RefSeq construct segments when clustering, ensuring that clustering was first attempted within the longer, canonical references. ULCUST was run with a requirement of \u226590% sequence identity to fold into a parent influenza RefSeq entries segment.

NimbleGen's Sequence Capture design offered up to 2.1 million of 50\u2013105mer sequence probes. It was at the discretion of NimbleGen, based on proprietary algorithms, to redistribute probes for better capture uniformity, redundancy, and comprehensive target base coverage. NimbleGen provided us with a proposed capture design accompanied by coordinate (GFF, BED) files and associated sequence coverage metrics on April 14, 2014. The design set contained probe representation generated by first masking all but one exact copy of each 100-mer in our original FASTA file, tiling the unmasked regions, screening the resulting probes against the (hg19) human genome, and finally selecting only those probes that had no matches in the human genome as determined by the SSAHA algorithm. NimbleGen provides two metrics for assessing in silico targeted sequence capture design coverage: (1) Target bases covered with 0-bp-offset are determined by counting target bases directly represented in probe sequences, and (2) target bases covered with 100-bp-offset are determined by counting all target bases within 100 bp of a probe.
