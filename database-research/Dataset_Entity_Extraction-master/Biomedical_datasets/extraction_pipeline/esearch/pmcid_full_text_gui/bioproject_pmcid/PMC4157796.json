Most of the miRNAs that have been identified in model plants are well characterized, but till now, no reports have previously been published concerning miRNAs in Paulownia australis. In order to investigate miRNA-guided transcript target regulation in P. australis, small RNA libraries from two P. australis (diploids, PA2; and autotetraploids, PA4) genotypes were subjected to Solexa sequencing. As a result, 10,691,271 (PA2) and 10,712,733 (PA4) clean reads were obtained, and 45 conserved miRNAs belonging to 15 families, and 31 potential novel miRNAs candidates were identified. Compared with their expression levels in the PA2 plants, 26 miRNAs were up-regulated and 15 miRNAs were down-regulated in the PA4 plants. The relative expressions of 12 miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Using the degradome approach, 53 transcript targets were identified and annotated based on Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. These targets were associated with development, stimulus response, metabolism, signaling transduction and biological regulation. Among them, 11 targets, including TCP transcription factors, auxin response factors, squamosa promoter-binding-like proteins, scarecrow-like proteins, L-type lectin-domain containing receptor kinases and zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein, cleaved by four known miRNA family and two potentially novel miRNAs were found to be involved in regulating plant development, biotic and abiotic stresses. The findings will be helpful to facilitate studies on the functions of miRNAs and their transcript targets in Paulownia.

In plants, emerging data demonstrate that miRNAs play vital regulatory roles in a wide range of biological processes, including regulation of plant growth, development, signal transduction, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses via interactions with their specific target mRNAs. Thereby, understanding of miRNAs functions in plant requires the recognition of their target genes. Initially, based on the either perfect or near-perfect sequence complementarity between miRNAs and their target mRNAs, the plant miRNA transcript targets have been identified via computational prediction. However, computational target prediction method is very challenging because of the existence of a higher mismatch in miRNA-target mRNA pairing. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, recently, a transcriptome wide experimental method combining high-throughput miRNA profiling with degradome sequencing analysis, has been successfully developed to identify miRNA-directed mRNA cleavage at a large scale. Using this strategy, so many plant species have been studied, for instance, Arabidopsis , Oryza sativa , maize , Brassica napus , Medicago truncatula , Fragaria ananassa , grapevine , Taxus , Populus trichocarpa , Populus euphratica , Trifoliate orange , Paulownia tomentosa , and Paulownia fortunei .

It is a very adaptable, extremely fast-growing woody plant, and in managed plantations, it can be harvested for saw timber in as little as 5 years. Paulownia can not only provide wood for a variety of products including timber, fuelwood, herbal medicines, boxes, clogs, musical instruments, and surfboards, but can also benefit the environment and ecology; for example, it can increase crop production when used for intercropping on farmland, and prevent soil erosion. Because of its specific characteristics and economic value, in its native China, Paulownia is popular for reforestation, intercropping on farmland, and roadside and garden planting. To enlarge the germplasm and breed new varieties, in recent years, several autotetraploid paulownia seedlings were induced successfully using colchicines. The autotetraploid cultivars of paulownia contains two sets of the same chromosomes, and compared with their diploid progenitors, the autotetraploids have better timber quality and improved stress resistance, which makes understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences of diploids and autotetraploids imperative. To our knowledge, the different paulownia species have genetic diversity and differentiation, although miRNAs in the P. tomentosa  and P. fortunei species have been identified, there have been no detailed reports of miRNAs in P. australis.

{"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA was employed to predict novel miRNAs. We found that 31 of the potential pre-miRNAs met this requirement; 15 pre-miRNAs exhibited the 3p:5p miRNA pair, providing more evidence that they were novel miRNAs, while the other 16 miRNAs were also considered to be potentially novel miRNAs (Table 2 and Table S4). Among the 31 candidate novel miRNAs, 10 miRNAs were common between the two libraries, while 10 and 11 were specific to PA2 and PA4, respectively. The length of the mature miRNAs varied from 20 to 23 nt, with the majority being 21-nt long. The mature miRNA sequences were localized inside the stem-loop structures, with almost half in either the 3p or 5p arms.

The target transcripts were pooled and grouped into three categories (I\u2013III) according to their relative abundances (Figure 1). Among these identified targets, 32 (37 cleavage sites) belonged to category I, and 20 (34 cleavage sites) and six (six cleavage sites) targets belonged to categories II and III, respectively (Table S5). We then performed a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to assign functional annotations to the predicted target genes, as described previously. More than 80% of the target genes were annotated as being involved in regulation of biological processes, and the GO annotations for the predicted target genes are shown in Figure 2. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway database was used to further classify the miRNA target genes. The KEGG Pathway annotation showed that the target genes were involved in metabolic pathways, plant-pathogen interaction, pyruvate metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, purine metabolism, RNA polymerase, pyrimidine metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, cellular metabolism, and disease.

Further, the expressions of pas-miR160a, pas-miR167, pas-miR171a, pas-miR397a, pas-mir1, and pas-mir14 in PA4 were up-regulated in the 30-day plantlets, and down-regulated in the PA4 in the 2-year saplings, while the expressions of pas-mir3 were the opposite to this. Thus, with the development of the plants, the expression levels of some of the miRNAs showed different trends. Six miRNAs (pas-miR160a, pas-miR167, pas-miR319a-3p, pas-miR398a,-3p pas-miR408a-3p, pas-mir1) had the same expression trend between PA2 and PA4 in the two stages. Furthermore, to confirm the reliability of degradome sequencing technology and the potential correlation between miRNAs and their transcript targets, 12 genes from two P. australis genotypes were also selected for qRT-PCR assays. The results showed that except the targets of auxin response factor (ARF) ARF8 (CL4211.Contig3) and scarecrow-like protein (SCL) SCL15 (CL10503.Contig1), the expression levels of the rest targets were inversely correlated with these of the corresponding miRNAs (Figure 3). During the different developmental stages, pas-miR160a, pas-miR167, pas-miR171 and pas-mir1 at a relatively higher level in the PA4 than in the PA2 at the 30-day plantlets stage, and lower level at the 2-year saplings stage, while its transcript targets, CL3173.Contig7, CL11603.Contig1, CL6407.Contig9, CL11078.Contig2, CL11078.Contig3, and Unigene9061 expressed in the reverse way as expected, and these coding for proteins are members of the auxin response factors ARF10, ARF18 and ARF6, the scarecrow-like proteins SCL6 and SCL22, and serine/threonine protein kinase, respectively. The expression levels of pas-miR319a-3p in PA4 were significantly lower than in the PA2 at two treatment stages, while the reverse was true for the transcription factor TCP4 (CL9103.Contig3) (Figure 3). Moreover, a reverse trend was noted between pas-miR156c and its target genes coding for squamosa promoter-binding-like protein (SPL) SPL6 and SPL12 (CL11428.Contig2 and CL5129.Contig2), and between pas-mir22-3p and its target gene coding for zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 53 (CL1197.Contig2) in the PA4 as compared to the PA2 (Figure 3). These results indicated that the miRNA and transcript target expression patterns were very complex and varied during the growth and development of P. australis. Furthermore, the possible roles of these miRNAs in the genome duplication changes from diploid to autotetraploid in these plants were revealed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27372, "infons": {"file": "pone.0106736.g003.jpg", "id": "pone-0106736-g003", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "Relative expression levels of the target genes in P. australis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27436, "infons": {"file": "pone.0106736.g003.jpg", "id": "pone-0106736-g003", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "PA2-1, 30-day-old diploid in vitro plantlets; PA4-1, 30-day-old autotetraploid in vitro plantlets; PA2-2, two-year-old diploid saplings; PA4-2, two-year-old autotetraploid saplings.

Generally speaking, genome duplication has led to the production of fast-growing, high-quality plants. The autotetraploid P. australis, which contains two sets of the same chromosomes, displayed apparent alterations in morphology, growth development, physiology, and gene expression when compared with their diploid counterparts. However, the mechanisms for these changes are poorly understood. MiRNAs are a class of endogenous small RNAs that have been involved in many processes, including growth, development, and resistance to stress and disease, by their ability to regulate gene expression in plants. To understand the functions of miRNAs in diploid and autotetraploid P. australis, in this present study, we used Solexa sequencing and degradome approaches to construct two sRNA libraries and two degradome libraries from the PA2 and PA4 plants to identify conserved and novel miRNAs and their transcript targets. A total of 45 conserved miRNAs belonging to 15 miRNA families and 31 potential novel miRNA candidates along with 53 transcript targets were identified across the PA2 and PA4 libraries. Most of the identified conserved miRNA families are also conserved in other plant species, including Populus tomentosa , Populus euphratica , Oryza sativa , and Arabidopsis thaliana . In the PA2 and PA4 libraries, the expression patterns varied dramatically among the different miRNA families, and different members in the same miRNA family also displayed significantly different expression levels. For instance, the read number varied from 26 (miR171 family) to 1,422,532 (miR166 family) (Table 1), and members of the miR166 family varied in abundance from 50,932 to 563,946 reads (Table 1). Moreover, the majority of novel miRNAs had relatively low expressions, and only five (PA2) and six (PA4) of the novel miRNA candidates had more than 1,000 reads (Table 2). Our results are in accordance with previous reports that novel miRNAs were often represented in relatively lower levels than conserved miRNAs. Furthermore, it is possible that the low-expression novel miRNAs may play particular functions in specific tissues, during developmental stages, or under various growth conditions. Whether these low-expression miRNAs are expressed at higher levels in other tissues or developmental stages, or are regulated by environmental stresses, remain to be investigated.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31085, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous studies have shown that many of the genes appeared to be methylated in tetraploid Paulownia plants specifically after genome duplication by the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism analysis. DNA methylation has been reported to be involved in inducing gene silencing, which can restart or change the genes expression levels. Salmon et al. found that significant changes in DNA methylation patterns could explain the morphological plasticity and larger ecological amplitude of Spartina allopolyploids. Indeed, we found that the expression levels of many of the differentially expressed miRNAs in the PA4 library were not increased by more than two-fold compared with their expressions in the PA2 library. However, the expressions of about half of these miRNAs were significantly different in the two libraries. Some of the miRNAs were expressed at similar level in the PA4 and PA2 libraries (Table 2). These findings are similar to those reported previously in P. tomentosa, P. fortunei and tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana lines, suggesting that the genome merger in the PA4 plants lead to nonadditive expression of the miRNA primary transcripts and miRNA target genes. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the differentially expressed miRNAs and transcript targets at different development stages were validated by qRT-PCR. The result showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs caused different expression levels in their transcript targets. Interestingly, we also found the expression levels of two target genes (CL4211.Contig3 and CL10503.Contig1) were inconsistent with those of their corresponding miRNAs (pas-miR167 and pas-miR171a). The similar phenomena were also observed in P. tomentosa, Phalaenopsis Aphrodite and cotton, indicating that the other mechanisms of regulating expression of the target genes exist. Above all, these results imply that the miRNAs with significantly varied expressions in the PA2 and PA4 P. australis plants are probably involved in the epigenetic changes of PA4 plants; however, the relation between the miRNA expression patterns and genome duplication may be more complex than we first thought.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33244, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To understand the biological functions of miRNAs, it is necessary to identify their transcript targets. In the present study, to avoid false-positive predictions of miRNA transcript targets in P. australis, we identified the 53 transcript targets for 11 miRNA families and three novel miRNA candidates by degradome sequencing, which opens up a new avenue for high-throughput validation of splicing targets. The target genes predicted for the conserved miRNAs in P. australis were similar or functionally related to validated plant miRNA targets, which were annotated as being involved in diverse physiological processes. For instance, pas-miR156 targeted the SPL protein family, which can affect diverse developmental processes such as leaf development, shoot maturation, phase change, and flowering in plants; and pas-miR167 targeted ARF6 and ARF 8, which belong to a class of transcription factors known to control multiple processes in plants, including the regulation of gynoecium and stamen maturation, and seed dispersal.

We found that the expression level of pas-miR319a-3p decreased by about 3-fold in PA4 compared with its level in PA2, and pas-miR319a-3p was predicted to target TCP transcription factors, which are plant-specific transcription factors that have been shown to participate in specifying plant morphological traits, such as organ border delimitation, cell division and proliferation, flower and leaf shape, and shoot outgrowth. In Arabidopsis, the TCP transcription factors have been related to control of the morphology of shoot lateral organs and formation of the shoot meristem-dependent regulation of the expression of boundary-specific genes. The putative transcription factor SCL is a number of GRAS protein family that are involved in several aspects of plant growth and development, including control of asymmetric cell division, maintenance of stem cell status, and induction of the regeneration of the root tip after laser ablation, and SCL expression has been associated with auxin distribution in root apical meristem. In this study, three SCL genes were predicted to be targeted by the miR171 family, which was up-regulated in the PA4 plants. This result suggested that SCL may be involved in the formation of adventitious root and the other aerial organs of Paulownia. L-type lectin-domain containing receptor kinases (lecRKs) and zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein were predicted to be targeted by pas-miR1 and pas-miR22-3p, respectively, suggesting that, besides their possible involvement in plant development, some of the miRNA target genes identified in this study could play fundamental roles in biotic and abiotic stresses. A previous study showed that LecRKs were most likely plasma membrane proteins, and were probably involved in mediating protein-protein interactions with a wide range of functions such as recognition of oligosaccharide or lipochitooligosaccharide signals, linking ABA-signaling, and response to salt, drought, cold stress, wounding, and disease in plants. Zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein is a kind of RNA-binding protein and many studies have shown that it may be regulated by abiotic or biotic stresses, and could have regulatory functions in mRNA processing, thus supporting the possible roles for pas-miR1 and pas-miR22-3p in the adaptive response of PA4 to abiotic stress.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36908, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on the GO analysis of the targets of the identified miRNAs in the two P. australis genotypes plants, the target genes were separated into the biological process, cellular component, and molecular function.

Thus, our results suggest that the transcript targets might be closely related to the observed differences of phenotype (environmental adaptations) and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses between the PA4 and PA2 plants. The functional role of the differentially expressed miRNAs will be the focus of future investigations. No target genes were predicted for many of the miRNAs identified in the two P. australis sRNA libraries, and a few of the predicted target genes were annotated as being of unknown function and hypothetical genes.
