Second, there is no single road map to eusociality; independent evolutionary transitions in sociality have independent genetic underpinnings. Third, though clearly independent in detail, these transitions do have similar general features, including an increase in constrained protein evolution accompanied by increases in the potential for gene regulation and decreases in diversity and abundance of transposable elements.

Similar results have been reported for bee and ant species; our findings reveal the underlying causes. Approximately two-thirds of these genes are under stronger directional selection in species with increasingly complex eusociality, but we also detected nonadaptive evolution.

A similar pattern of reduced evolutionary rate has been described for genes expressed in human and honey bee brains, potentially due to increasing pleiotropic constraint in complex gene networks.
