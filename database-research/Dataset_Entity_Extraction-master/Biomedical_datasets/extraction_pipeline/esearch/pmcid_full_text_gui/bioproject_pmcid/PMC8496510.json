Rick Tomato Genetic Resources Centre (University of California at Davis), indicates resistance to drought stress as a general feature of S.sitiens, and recommends accessions LA1974 and LA2876 for investigations related to drought. Accession LA1974, the object of this study, was collected by Carlos Ochoa from Chuquicamata, Antofagasta, Chile in 1979 from an extremely dry habitat. The collection sites recorded for S.sitiens are typically arid and with soil salinity at levels where cultivated tomatoes would not be productive. Descriptions of the morphological adaptations of S.sitiens to drought are reported: thick leathery leaves that are small and able to fold along the mid-vein, and the ability to regenerate from the base of the stem after prolonged drought. However, there are no known studies of drought physiology in this species. In addition, S.sitiens has a seed dispersal strategy unique within the Solanum genus in which fruits desiccate, rather than soften and ripen, and then drop to the ground for dispersal by wind or by rolling down slopes. Recently, a library of 56 introgression lines representing 93% of the genome of S.sitiens accessions LA4331 and LA1974 was reported.
