However, LOS is often caused by organisms that are typically found colonizing the intestinal tract, suggesting that LOS may often originate from translocation of gut organisms across the intestinal lining into the blood stream. Indeed, several small studies have demonstrated that the majority of LOS cases, in particular, those caused by group B Streptococcus, Serratia marcescens, or Escherichia coli strains, are due to organisms that were detectable in infant stool samples collected prior to the occurrence of sepsis. Several investigators have applied 16S microbial community analysis to examine distortions in the intestinal microbiota in advance of neonatal sepsis. A study of six infants found that those who later developed sepsis had an intestinal microbiota distinct from that of healthy infants; samples from infants who later developed LOS tended to have more Staphylococcus and Proteobacteria than healthy infants who exhibited greater microbial diversity and more anaerobic bacteria. Another study, of 10 LOS cases and 18 matched control infants, found a decrease in diversity and lower Bifidobacteria counts preceding LOS compared to control infants.

Restoration of the microbial community through fecal transplant is highly successful in treating refractory C. difficile disease. Another example of microbial community dysbiosis predisposing to disease is seen in the different colonization patterns of preterm infants who develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) compared to infants who remain healthy.

The initial analyses used the first available stool sample from each infant prior to LOS.

To select the appropriate sample from controls for this analysis, the sample collection day of life was frequency matched to the sample collection day of life for the sepsis cases by sampling without replacement. We first created a table including the day of life of collection of all samples from control infants and a table of collection day of life of the last sample prior to sepsis for all case samples. The first control sample was selected by identifying the collection day of life of a case sample on which the fewest control samples were available. Those two samples and all additional samples from that control and case infants were then removed from the pool eligible for selection. The selection of the next control sample was made by again identifying the collection day of life of a case sample with the fewest control samples to choose from.

While the source of microbes causing LOS is not well established, reports suggest that the gut is often the source of microbes causing LOS in preterm neonates. We used high-throughput sequencing to address the relationship between gut colonization and neonatal LOS. Consistent with previous reports, we identified a concordance of 82% between the causative LOS organism and its identification in stool samples prior to LOS; previous studies have reported concordance ranging from 64% to 95%. In this and an earlier publication, we have reported differences in colonization between our two study sites, which was the basis for analyzing the gut microbiota at each site separately. Site-specific analyses identified differences in microbial-community patterns in advance of LOS compared to controls. In Cincinnati, we found lower levels of Actinobacteria in early samples from infants who later developed LOS compared to controls, similar to a report from Mai et al, in which lower levels of Bifidobacteria, a genus of the phylum Actinobacteria, were observed in infants who later developed LOS. In Birmingham, we found lower microbial-diversity in infants with LOS compared to controls, similar to reports by Madan et al. and Mai et al.. In Birmingham, the presence of Lactobacillales in the last sample was associated with protection against LOS, whereas in Cincinnati, the presence of Lactobacillales in the first sample, but not the last sample, was associated with protection against LOS. Thus, while we found significant site-specific differences in gut-microbial patterns in advance of LOS, we failed to detect a specific and generalizable gut-microbial colonization pattern in advance of LOS. Furthermore, the observed differences were dependent not only on site, but also on the timing of sample collection. Previous studies at single sites have reported associations with gut microbiota prior to the onset of sepsis, but also like the current study, the reported associations are not consistent between sites: One study found an association between increased abundance of Staphylococcaceae  and sepsis, while another found an association between decreased abundance of Clostridia and sepsis; and some, but not all studies reported lower alpha diversity in sepsis cases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34749, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "What could explain the site-specific differences in the gut-microbial pattern in advance of LOS?

In this study, we used site-, age-, birth weight- and sex-matched-controls thus minimizing the impact of confounding variables. However, the sites did significantly differ in their use of infant formula and the use of antibiotics (both were higher in Birmingham).

These sepsis-associated microbes did not occur more abundantly in infant stool samples in advance of LOS compared to controls.
