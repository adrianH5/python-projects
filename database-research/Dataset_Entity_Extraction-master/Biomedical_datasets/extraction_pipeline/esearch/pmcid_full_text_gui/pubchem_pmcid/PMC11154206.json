Despite this scenario, understanding how inflammation drives the progression of DCKD is attainable through leaky gut formation in two ways: first, development of DCKD alters gut microbes that influence uremic toxin accumulation; second, accumulation of protein-bound uremic toxins obtained through microbial metabolism of aromatic amino acids from host diet. A study by Pavan et al. identified gut microbial changes caused by CKD perpertuate, the accumulation of uremic toxic metabolites like p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate in serum/plasma, elevated systemic inflammation intensified the kidney disease. Conversely, consumption of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites (acetate, propionate and butyrate) produced by beneficial gut microbes, reduced kidney damage by protecting the proximal tubular cells in renal transplanted patients. Acetate, a type of SCFA metabolite treatment in ischemia\u2013reperfusion (I/R) kidney-injured mice model, lowered inflammation, reactive oxygen species, immune infiltration and increased epithelial cell proliferation in damaged kidneys. Furthermore, in children with chronic kidney disease, plasma-acetate appeared to reduce hypertension. Another study by Fabian et al. suggest diet supplements with propionate-SCFA to ESRD patients impede systemic elevation by expanding peripheral regulatory T-cells. Dietary precursor of tryptophan, trimethylamine-N oxide (TMAO), a protein bound uremic toxin metabolite influence the intestinal barrier integrity damage, play a role in insulin resistance and DKD development. Tryptophan metabolism by intestinal bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae results in the production of indoxyl sulfate, which damages kidneys by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).

Three seeds formed a relatively large network with 123 nodes and 134 edges. Of the three seeds, we found both NF-\u039aB1 and EGFR hub proteins are highly expressed in type2 diabetes mellitus conditions. Independently, the NF-\u039aB1 gene is expressed in kidney-related diseases like chronic kidney failure, hyperoxaluria and hypogammaglobulinemia, where the condition leads to decreased antibody levels in the blood. Specific expression of EGFR has been linked with acute kidney injury, insulin resistance, increased blood pressure,cardiomyopathy dilation and decreased body weight.
