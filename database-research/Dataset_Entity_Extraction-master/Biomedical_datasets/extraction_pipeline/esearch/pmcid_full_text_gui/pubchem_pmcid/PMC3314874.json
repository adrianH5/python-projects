Insulin binds to the extracellular region of the receptor and causes conformational changes that lead to the activation of the tyrosine kinase.

In Type 1 diabetes autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of pancreas leads to insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance or decreased insulin secretion. Insulin is essential for maintaining blood glucose and regulating carbohydrate metabolism. Insulin receptor (IR) is a tetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha subunits and two transmembrane beta subunits.The binding of insulin to alpha subunit of IR causes conformational changes in the receptor leading to the activation of tyrosine kinase beta subunit. The activated IR has the ability to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate intracellular substrates that are essential for initiating other cellular responses of insulin.These events lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules that participate in the insulin signaling pathway. Insulin signaling, including activation of IR tyrosine kinase activity, is impaired in most patients with diabetes mellitus.
