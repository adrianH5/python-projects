Here, we compared the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the Up state in the barrel cortex (BC) and mEC using whole cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices. Bath application of an NMDA receptor antagonist abolished Up states in the BC, and reduced the incidence but not the duration of Up states in the mEC. Conversely, blockade of kainate receptors decreased Up state duration in the mEC, but not in the BC. Voltage clamp recordings demonstrated the presence of a non-NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic current, sensitive to the selective kainate receptor antagonist UBP-302, in layer III neurons of the mEC, which was not observed in the BC. Moreover, we found that kainate receptor-mediated currents assist in recovery back to the Up state membrane potential following a current-induced hyperpolarisation of individual cells in the mEC.
