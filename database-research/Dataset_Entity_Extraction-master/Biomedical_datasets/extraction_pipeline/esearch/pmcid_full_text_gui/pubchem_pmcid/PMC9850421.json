Oxidative stress and inflammation are associated with many proteins, including Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (KEAP1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins. The active compounds contained in Holothuria scabra have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of sea cucumber\u2019s active compounds by targeting KEAP1 and iNOS proteins. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activity of H. scabra extract were measured spectrophotometrically. The 3-dimensional (3D) structures of sea cucumber\u2019s active compounds and proteins were obtained from the PubChem and Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) databases. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina software. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application (YASARA) software with environmental parameters according to the cell\u2019s physiological conditions. The membrane permeability test was performed using the PerMM web server. The methanol extract of H. scabra had a weak antioxidant activity against DPPH and strong activity against NO radical. Scabraside and holothurinoside G had the most negative binding affinity values when interacting with the active site of KEAP1 and iNOS proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations also showed that both compounds were stable when interacting with KEAP1 and iNOS. However, scabraside and holothurinoside G were difficult to penetrate the cell plasma membrane, which is seen from the high energy transfer value in the lipid acyl chain region of phospholipids. Scabraside and holothurinoside G are predicted to act as antioxidants and anti-inflammations, but in their implementation to in vitro and in vivo study, it is necessary to have liposomes or nanoparticles, or other delivery methods to help these 2 compounds enter the cell.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2177, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2190, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Oxidative stress and inflammation have important roles in the progression of various diseases, including cancer. The oxidative stress machinery and inflammatory signaling are interconnected and have a role in apoptosis, proliferation, and redox state control. Oxidative stress is an imbalance condition between free radicals and antioxidants in cells or tissues. Excessive free radicals can induce damage to cellular molecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. Free radicals are generated from various cellular activities, one of which is the protein inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity. Inducible nitric oxide synthase protein can produce nitric oxide (NO) from the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Nitric oxide in cells can undergo several reactions that produce reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that cause oxidative stress. In addition, NO can also stimulate various inflammatory responses. Inflammation is an organism\u2019s protective response to a pathogen or damaged cells, but long-term inflammation can be fatal to tissues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3242, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Oxidative stress and inflammation occur due to the activity of proteins such as Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (KEAP1) and iNOS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation, and protein NRF2 will control the presence of ROS/RNS. Activated NRF2 binds to avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) protein and acts as a transcription factor for antioxidant genes. NRF2 activity is controlled by KEAP1, which acts to inhibit NRF2 activity by promoting NRF2 degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Meanwhile, inflammation is induced by the iNOS protein. Inducible nitric oxide synthase is a primary downstream mediator of inflammation in various cell types. Inducible nitric oxide synthase protein can produce NO from the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Nitric oxide is a short-living signaling molecule with a proinflammatory effect. Oxidative stress, long-term inflammation, and cancer are closely linked. Many studies have revealed that KEAP1 and iNOS are promising therapeutic targets for several long-term diseases. Therefore, various synthetic drugs which act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories targeting KEAP1 or iNOS proteins were developed, such as AN-465 and PSTC for KEAP1-Nrf2 and CM544 and GW274150 for iNOS.  However, synthetic drugs often have adverse side effects, in contrast to natural drugs which rarely cause side effects.

The more positive the value, the more stable the protein-ligand interaction. The conformational stability of the protein after binding to the ligand was measured by the value of the radius of gyration (Rg), the number of hydrogen bonds, and the RMSF. Hydrogen bonds are needed to form the secondary structure of proteins so that the number of hydrogen bonds can be used as a parameter of protein conformational stability. The number of hydrogen bonds in KEAP1 and iNOS proteins when interacting with scabraside and holothurinoside G tends to be stable during the simulation indicating conformational stability. The radius of gyration represents protein structure compactness. A high Rg value indicates a protein conformation that blooms due to the loss of bonds between residues.

Nitric oxide production is related to the catalytic cycle process that facilitates the transfer of electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate to heme via flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide. The electron transfer cycle mediates the conversion of L-arg to L-citrulline with the concomitant production of NO. Nitric oxide is involved in many inflammatory regulatory functions such as infection control, vascular response regulation, leukocyte rolling, migration, and cytokine production. Inhibition of NO synthesis by inhibiting iNOS activity has been shown to inhibit inflammation. One strategy to inhibit iNOS activity is to inhibit the interaction of iNOS with L-arginine on the active site. The active site of iNOS is in the cavity containing heme, a cofactor that acts as electron transfer. Scabraside and holothurinoside G, which bind to the active site of iNOS with a lower binding affinity value than inhibitors, have great potential as new iNOS-inhibitor agents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27613, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Prediction of membrane permeability is necessary for developing and optimizing new drugs. Based on this study, scabraside and holothurinoside G have high energy transfer values in the lipid acyl chain region of the lipid bilayer, indicating that these 2 compounds are difficult to penetrate. One of the reasons why scabraside and holothurinoside G are challenging to penetrate cell membranes is that the compound size is too large. Compounds with a molecular weight of more than 500\u2009daltons will have difficulty penetrating the plasma membrane. In comparison, scabraside and holothurinoside G had sizes of 844.77 and 1427.53\u2009Da, respectively.
