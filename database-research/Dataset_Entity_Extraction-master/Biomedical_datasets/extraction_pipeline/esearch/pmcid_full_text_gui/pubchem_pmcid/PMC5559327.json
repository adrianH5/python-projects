Cell lines stably expressing luciferase reporter protein typically evaluate the transfection efficacy of siRNA/PEG-PEI complexes, however recent findings revealed that PEG-PEI can reduce luciferase expression independent of siRNA. This study elucidates a cause of the false positive effect in luciferase assays by using polymer nanoassemblies (PNAs) made from PEG, PEI, poly-(L-lysine) (PLL), palmitate (PAL), and deoxycholate (DOC): PEG-PEI (2P), PEG-PEI-PAL (3P), PEG-PLL (2P\u2032), PEG-PLL-PAL (3P\u2032), and PEG-PEI-DOC (2PD). In vitro transfection and western blot assays of luciferase using a colorectal cancer cell line expressing luciferase (HT29/LUC) concluded that 2P and 2P\u2032 caused no luciferase expression reduction while hydrophobically modified PNAs induced a 35-50% reduction (3P\u2032< 2PD < 3P). Although cell viability remained stagnant, 3P triggered cellular stress responses including increased membrane porosity and decreased ATP and cellular protein concentrations. Raman spectroscopy suggested that hydrophobic groups influence PNA conformation changes, which may have caused over-ubiquitination and degradation of luciferase in the cells. These results indicate that hydrophobically modified PEG-PEI induces cellular distress causing over-ubiquitination of the luciferase protein, producing false positive siRNA transfection in the luciferase assay.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1695, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Graphical abstract", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1714, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

However, siRNA often shows low transfection in vivo due to poor delivery efficiency. To improve delivery of siRNA to target sites, polymer-based non-viral gene vectors have been developed, which include ionic complexes between anionic siRNA and cationic polyethyleneimine (PEI). siRNA/PEI complexes have achieved successful gene silencing in various human cells in vitro, but they are unstable in the body. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) is frequently used to stabilize siRNA/PEI complexes. The hydrophilic PEG chains surrounding siRNA/PEI complexes can shield the particle charge and prevent protein adsorption. The siRNA/PEI complexes can be further modified with hydrophobic excipients and other additives for improving stability and fine-tuning release of siRNA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2704, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on this background, we developed siRNA delivery vectors by using polymer nanoassemblies (PNAs) made from PEG, PEI, and hydrophobic pendant groups such as palmitate (PAL). PNAs are unimolecular assemblies of 30 nm diameter particles having cationic polymer backbone to which PEG and a hydrophobic moiety can be covalently conjugated. In previous studies, we reported that these PNAs enhanced siRNA transfection in a human colorectal cancer HT29 cell line as functions of PEG composition and PAL modification. These PNAs displayed siRNA transfection efficiency comparable to PEG-PEI formulations developed by other research groups as well as commercially available transfection reagents such as RNAiMAX. However, we have recently observed that PEG-PEI alters siRNA transfection among product batches partially due to PEG compositions such as molecular weight, substitution rate, and PEI contaminants. PEG-PEI also appeared to substantially change siRNA transfection efficiency before and after conjugation of hydrophobic pendant groups, although the mechanism remained elusive. However, further study of the hydrophobic modification to PEG-PEI also revealed unexpectedly reduced luciferase expression in cells even in the absence of siRNA, called the false positive effect.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3982, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The false positive effect on siRNA transfection is troubling in evaluating and predicting in vivo performance of non-viral gene vectors made from PEG-PEI for future studies and clinical applications. Usually, protein reporter assays are used to evaluate the transfection efficiency of the siRNA/PEG-PEI complex, and luciferase is one of the reporter proteins that offer a quick method for measuring siRNA-mediated gene silencing in living cells. Luciferase protein activity is correlated to the amount of luciferase protein in the cell following siRNA transfection by measuring luminescence using luminogenic substrates. Luciferase has a short half-life in live cells, less than 3 hours, which makes it ideal for determining long-term siRNA transfection efficiency. Any protein left within the cell after incubation with siRNA/PEG-PEI complexes would be produced after the siRNA has had a chance to take effect. However, this would not account for protein that has been denatured or had its expression reduced by other means.

As a result, false positive effects are difficult to detect at a dosage showing no apparent cytotoxicity yet inducing cell stress. In fact, even free siRNA considered non-toxic seems to induce cellular stress and display off target effects, while little is known if and how PEG-PEI would induce non-specific gene silencing during siRNA transfection without inducing cytotoxicity.

Such false positives might be detrimental in developing siRNA-based therapeutic options that require specific gene silencing for targeted gene therapy. Additionally, these false positives occur without inducing cytotoxicity that is a common sign of an abnormal cell response.

However, it is unknown if this is due to decreased protein activity or cellular concentration of luciferase because the assay does not differentiate between the two conditions. To observe any loss of activity of luciferase due to PNA interaction, PNAs were incubated with free luciferase protein or free luciferin substrate before addition of the other component. Since protein incubation with 3P did not reduce the activity of luciferase, the protein concentration should be lower in the cell and this was supported by western blotting.

Raman spectroscopy measures the vibrational energy of chemical bonds in a compound which can determine the influence of PNA components on interactions with other compounds. These bond vibrations are unique and will change by either shifting their energy spectrum or reducing signal intensity depending on interactions or conformation of PNA components. Raman spectroscopy showed the differences in vibrational energies after the interaction between siRNA and components of 3P, their physical mixtures, and finally the complete PNAs. Initially, the Raman spectra detected minor intensity reductions when siRNA interacted with each separate component of 3P (PEG, PEI, and PAL). However, physical mixtures of components containing PAL (PEI/PAL and PEG/PAL) showed larger vibrational intensity changes than the components. The changes indicated that the PAL had influence over the conformation or interaction of the components with siRNA. When each component is tethered in a PNA, some vibrational changes are more intense when siRNA interacts with the PNAs. Even if the PAL and siRNA are not directly interacting, the Raman spectra show that PAL should influence the Raman shifts observed. Therefore, PAL may influence the way 3P condenses around the siRNA, which would further alter the particle conformation and disrupt vibrational energies. While this is not a strong correlation, it gives evidence that the inclusion of PAL in the PNA does influence the PNA condensation when it comes in to contact with other compounds.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30172, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PAL influence over PNA interaction with cellular components could induce cell stress without significant cytotoxicity. Cell stress is a condition where cell metabolism, protein concentration, and gene expression may be altered to combat cellular damage or sudden changes in environment. Though cell stress often leads to cytotoxicity, it can still be present without inducing significant toxicity and can be overlooked by some viability assays. The viability assay used in conjunction with the transfection assays was a resazurin based assay which is a widely-used method for determining cell viability in mammalian cells. Resazurin is reduced to a fluorescent molecule, resorufin, in the cell indicating redox activity which correlates with cell viability. This assay focuses on cell metabolism and does not account for other indicators of cell health. Three other markers of cell health were examined to obtain a more complete picture of cell health: total protein concentration in cells, ATP production, and membrane porosity. Cells dosed with 3P exhibited less total protein, lower ATP concentration, and more porous membranes than those of the control group. Lowered total protein production does indicate cell death has occurred but the amount of cell death indicated in Figure 8 would not completely account for the reduced luciferase concentration. More porous membranes and lowered ATP production are significant signs of cell stress and adds further evidence that 3P is not completely harmless to the cell.

Lipids attached to cationic head groups have been shown to increase enzyme inhibition inside cells, a result of both cationic and lipophilic regions. Additionally, cationic polymers and some lipids can reduce protein expression and increased protein degradation due to cell stress. However, it should be noted that these cell stress mechanisms are due to free components either alone or removed from their respective nanoparticles. The purification methods used during PNA synthesis removed all free hydrophobic groups and the hydrophobic moieties to the PEI backbone are stable so that no free hydrophobic groups would be present in formulation.

One mechanism of protein reduction in the cell is increased ubiquitination of proteins, which increases their proteasome degradation. Protein ubiquitination occurs normally in the cell as part of the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway but is increased in times of stress or when certain pathways are activated, such as autophagy. Western blotting confirmed an increase in the molecular weight of luciferase inside cells dosed with hydrophobically modified PNAs. Although this is not direct evidence of luciferase ubiquitination, an increase in molecular weight of a protein can often be the result of ubiquitination. The increase in the high molecular weight luciferase band after proteasome inhibition gives further evidence that this is ubiquitinated luciferase. As previously mentioned, hydrophobic groups may cause oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress which has been shown to increase protein ubiquitination. These stresses can also lead to regulated cell death which would increase protein ubiquitination as well. We emphasize that this process is one plausible mechanism leading to false positive effects shown in our study and there might be a more complicated interplay among toxicity, cell stress, and nanoparticle compositions.

The data suggests that the hydrophobic group is most influential, compared with backbone structure, in generating the false positive. To achieve this, the hydrophobic component would be required to interact near the surface of the PNA. PNAs exist as a single polymer, core/shell systems regardless of the presence of siRNA, as evidenced by our previous study, and empty PNAs should behave similarly to complexed PNAs. Hydrophobic moieties are housed in the core of the PNA and the PEG shell should prevent their interaction while the PNA maintains its secondary structure, or folded state. However, PNAs could be in a state of equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states. The addition of PEG and PAL will drive the equilibrium toward the folded state, forming a core/shell environment, but a small percentage of the unfolded state will persist.

In particular, 3P has both cationic and hydrophobic regions, and thus they can attract coenzymes like ATP through both ionic and hydrophobic interactions. After the coenzyme is charge neutralized, they may be entrapped in PNAs further strongly by hydrophobic interactions. We previously confirmed that PNAs altered drug release patterns in the presence of hydrophobic excipients outside of the PNAs, yet these hydrophobic excipients were not found to enter the PNA but weakly bound the surface of the PNA. Therefore, binding of cofactors to the surface or inside the PNA is possible and can cause cell stress.
