significant part of embedded human civilization. In the 14th century, ethanol, also recognized as \u201cburning water\u201d, was extensively used as a remedy for diseases and epidemics. Over time, distilled liquors emerged as a lifestyle commodity, satisfying the sensory and psychological needs of humanity. They were developed in various parts of the world during the early stages of civilization. The flavor characteristics of distilled liquors have become crucial in determining consumer acceptance and adoption. Ethanol and water are the main components, accounting for 97% to 98% of the total content, while the remaining 2% to 3% consists of trace components. These trace components, known as odorants or aroma-active compounds, interact with human olfactory receptors. They include alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, acetals, furans, terpenes, sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds, each contributing to the unique sensory properties and aroma attributes such as fruity and floral notes (J.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2864, "infons": {"file": "gr1.jpg", "id": "f0005", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Recent trends and research hotspot in flavor of distilled liquors (A: The keyword clustering co-occurrence landscape; B: The top 9 keywords with the strongest citation bursts).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3041, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Numerous studies have focused on identifying potent odorants that contribute to the flavor of various distilled liquors.

Raw materials for brewing are generally crops with high sugar or starch values (M. C.). In the case of gin, it involves the use of botanicals and grain distillates as ingredients (Fig. 2). Distilled liquors produced through grain fermentation exhibit some similarities in terms of alcohol compounds, esters, and carbonyls; The manufacturing process of distilled liquors consists of two main sections: fermentation and distillation. Fermentation is a natural process in which microorganisms break down organic substances containing carbohydrates. Baijiu, for example, utilizes a mixture called \u201cQu\u201d to catalyze saccharification and fermentation, while other distilled liquors employ yeast. Distillation, on the other hand, involves heating the fermentation mixture in an ethanol atmosphere in the gas phase to enrich substances, which are then returned to the liquid fraction to generate the desired flavor. Reactions that occur during the manufacturing process include enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Enzymatic reactions primarily involve biosynthesis processes using precursors like straight-chain, branched-chain, aromatic, sulfur-containing amino acids, as well as linolenic acid, linoleic acid, pigments, and other constituents (Mosedale, 1995). Non-enzymatic reactions encompass the thermal effects of the distillation process, resulting in oxidation, decomposition, degradation, and the production of aroma substances. Additionally, interactions between components or thermal degradation (Maillard reaction) contribute to the formation of odorants; Maturation circumstances also play a vital role in the formation of odorants. Baijiu, for instance, is initially stored in pottery jars for a limited time and then may undergo extended maturation in stainless steel tanks (Z.). Brandy, whiskey, and rum, on the other hand, involve maturation in oak barrels, where the degradation of hemicellulose and lignin supports the formation of volatile phenols and lactones.

The flavor of Baijiu usually plays an essential role in consumer acceptance. To date, more than 2000 trace components have been detected in Baijiu, including esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, acetals, lactones, terpenes, sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing groups, which significantly contribute to the sensory properties of Baijiu (Fig. 4) (J.). Baijiu possesses a multitude of sensory properties and a broad range of odorants. The key odorants in the four aroma types of Baijiu, obtained by calculating OAV, are summarized in Table 1. In comparison to other distilled liquors, Baijiu exclusively utilizes \u201cqu\u201d as a saccharifying and fermenting ingredient. \u201cQu\u201d is a mixture of yeasts, molds, and bacteria cultured on grains, classified into daqu, xiaoqu, and fuqu. The special advantage of \u201cqu\u201d lies in its natural inoculation with multi-strain organisms during the primarily open process of solid-state fermentation(Z.). Typically, a diverse and numerous microbiological population evolves in this environment.

This unique process plays a significant role in the formation of the aroma components found in soy sauce aroma Baijiu.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31138, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Numerous works have been undertaken to determine the aroma components of soy sauce aroma Baijiu and approximately thousands of volatile components have been detected(; Niu, Zhang, et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The odorants such as 3-methylbutanol, 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine, ethyl 2-phenylacetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate, ethyl 3-phenylpropanoate, 4-methylguaiacol, and \u03b3-decalactone were considered to have high aroma intensity(W. Fan et al., 2012). Sulphur and nitrogen-containing odorants were claimed to have a potential contribution to flavor profiles of Soy sauce aroma Baijiu and have drawn much attention(Chen et al., 2017b; Yan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). For example, 2-furfurylthiol(roasted sesame seeds-like), methanethiol(cooked vegetable-like), dimethyl trisulfide(onion-like, sulfurous), ethanethiol(onion-like, rubber-like), methional(cooked potato-like), furfuryl methyl disulfide(roast, smoke), 2-methyl-3-(methyldisulfanyl)furan(meat-like, roast), 2-methyl-3-furanthiol(meat-like, sulfur), and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine(roast, green, galbanum)(Zhu et al., 2020) had relatively high OAVs. Further to their contribution to the overall aroma, several sulfur-containing odorants have been proposed as markers to distinguish among light, strong and soy saucy aroma Baijiu. These include 2-methyl-3-furanthiol(meat-like, PubChem CID: 34286), 2-furfurylthiol (toasted sesame-like, PubChem CID: 7363) , the 3-mercaptohexanol (PubChem CID: 521348) and 4-methyl-4-mercapto-2-pentanone (tropical fruit-like, PubChem CID: 88290). Duan et al charted the flavor wheel of soy saucy aroma Baijiu from the classification of fermented aroma, materials aroma, off-odor, and empty cup aroma. The sensory properties of soy sauce aroma Baijiu were described as sauce, ageing, cellar, caramel, floral, fruity and grain. Notably, the sauce aroma is a crucial characteristic that significantly impacts the overall flavor of soy sauce aroma Baijiu. Niu and colleagues found positive correlations between sauce attributes and ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, benzaldehyde, and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, with correlations of 0.999, 0.998, and 0.997, respectively. Similarly, the aging attribute showed correlations with butyl butyrate, pentanoic acid, and 3-methylbutyl acetate of 0.979, 0.931, and 0.909, respectively. The caramel attribute exhibited a correlation with ethyl lactate, furfuryl alcohol, and ethyl phenylacetate, with a correlation of 1.000. The floral attribute displayed correlations with ethyl hexanoate, ethyl hexadecanoate, and ethyl myristate of 1.000, 0.999, and 0.999, respectively. Lastly, the fruity attribute showed correlations with 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 1,1-diethoxyethane, and ethyl butyrate of 0.995, 0.982, and 0.957, respectively. In addition, sensory analysis showed a synergistic effect of dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide on increasing fruit aroma intensity, possibly by lowering the threshold of fruit aroma. Similarly, ethyl hexanoate, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 3-mercaporhexyl acetate, and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine could significantly decrease the threshold of aromatic reconstitution(Zhu et al., 2020). Niu and colleagues found that different concentrations of ethyl isobutyrate and ethyl isovalerate have additional or synergistic odor effects on the mixture, as determined by the Feller's additive model and OAV analysis(Niu, Zhu, et al., 2020). The burnt note, which resembles an overcooked rice flavor, is indeed a prominent characteristic of soy sauce aroma Baijiu. Researchers have identified 2-hydroxymethyl-3,6-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine and 6-(2-formyl-5-methyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl) hexanoic acid as the markers for this burnt aroma (T.). However, the key contributors to the unique sauce note in soy sauce aroma Baijiu are still not fully understood. Wang et al conducted reconstitution experiments using 52 aroma compounds but were unable to reproduce the typical sauce aroma. These experiments confirmed that trimethyl-pyrazine, furfural, 4-ethyl guaiacol, and furaneol were not associated with the characteristic soy sauce aroma. Fan proposed some conjectures about the nature of the key odorants responsible for the soy sauce aroma. They suggested that these odorants have relatively high boiling points, strong polarity, alcohol-lipid solubility, very low concentrations, even lower thresholds, and a tendency towards acidity or neutrality. These conjectures provide some insights into the potential characteristics of the key odorants that contribute to the soy sauce aroma in Baijiu.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35701, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the brewing process of Baijiu, exceeding the critical concentration of certain flavor compounds can disrupt the overall aroma coordination, resulting in unpleasant flavors. Soy sauce aroma Baijiu is known to have typical defects such as mud-like, pickle-like, rancid, and musty earth odors. The research indicates that geosmin contributes to an earthy note in defective liquors, while 3-octanol and 1-octen-3-ol impart a mushroom/fungal odor to Baijiu. Sulfur compounds(L.), such as 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, methional, methyl 2-methyl-3-furyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, 2-furfurylthiol, methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, and higher concentrations of bis (2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide, play a key role in the pickle-like note of Moutai Baijiu. Furthermore, 4-methylphenol has been identified as the compound responsible for the animal/fur odor in various types of Baijiu, including soy sauce aroma Baijiu. Understanding the sources of off-odors can help in controlling the quality of Baijiu. For instance, studies have demonstrated that adding high concentrations of 1-propanol or 2-phenylethanol to the Baijiu matrix can mask the sweaty note of 3-methylbutyric acid using \u03c3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03c4 plot and partition coefficient analysis(Niu, Zhang, et al., 2020).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36957, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As detection equipment continues to improve and detection methods are optimized, it is anticipated that the flavor profile of soy sauce aroma Baijiu will eventually be fully understood in the future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37157, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Rice-aroma Baijiu", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37175, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Rice-aroma Baijiu is made from rice as the main ingredient and undergoes saccharification and fermentation using xiaoqu.

P.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47906, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The main odorants of brandy include higher alcohols, esters, terpenes, norisoprenoids, volatile phenols, heterocyclics, aldehydes, ketones, acids, nitrogenous and sulfur-containing compounds. It were reported that 150 odorants in freshly distilled brandy were identified, with sensory properties described as butter, hay, grass, pear and banana, rose, the lime tree that were interpreted by diacetyl, nerolidol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, 2- and 3-methylbutyl acetates, 2-phenylethyl acetate and linalool, respectively. applied AEDA analysis to four commercial brandies and determined that the most important odorants were 2-methylpropanol, 3-methylbutanol, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl octanoate, \u03b2-damascenone, and trans-oaklactone (FD\u00a0\u2265\u00a01024). Typically, esters, alcohols, and acids are most abundant in freshly distilled brandy, followed by benzene compounds, terpenoids, C13-norisoprenoids, as well as aldehydes and ketones. Additionally, hexanoic, octanoic and their corresponding ethyl esters are relatively high in concentration, especially ethyl caprate with a grape odor. Elevated levels of isoamyl acetate can negatively affect the flavor of Cognac, which enhances the miscellaneous alcoholic base and spiciness in the taste. During the maturation process, the alcohol concentration decreases significantly, while concentration of acetal and ester increasing. Changes that occur during long-term storage of Cognac can be accounted by the non-enzymatic oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes to acids, followed by esterification with ethanol and the formation of ethanolides and acetals from aldehydes. Moreover, based on the investigation, there exists a positive correlation between the concentration of furan compounds and maturing duration. Moreover, ethyl 5-oxotetrahy\u00addro-2-furancarboxylate, which imparts a smoky aroma, exhibits a high odor activity value. Brandy contains a greater abundance of terpenes and C13-norisoprenoids derivatives compared to other distilled liquors. Terpenoids are present in grapes in either free form or glycosidic-bound form. The free state terpenoids are released in low concentrations during distillation. The glycosidic-bound terpenoids are released during fermentation, and their levels have been reported to correlate with \u03b2-glycosidase activity in yeast strains. Previous research quantified and assayed thresholds for terpenoids in aged cognacs, such as geraniol, \u03b1-terpinene, nerol, \u03b1-terpineol, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), the first detection of piperitone, santalol, and \u03b1-campholenal in Cognac, as well as the discovery of \u03b2-damascenone and whiskey lactone enhanced the perception of terpenes. (E)-\u03b2-damascenone has been shown to be a component of the cognac brandy matrix at levels well above its olfactory detection threshold. It is presumed that the higher concentration of terpenes in matured cognacs may be due to the fact that when the wine is distilled with the yeast lees, the adsorption of terpenes by the yeast lees may occur. With the heat of distillation, the adsorption can be stopped and the terpenes can be released. The exposure of Cognac to oak leads to the saturation of phenols such as vanillin, ethyl vanillin, vanillic acid, syringaldehyde, syringic acid, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, gallic acid, ellagic acid, ferulic acid and other polyphenols. By identifying volatiles in Armagnac, Cognac, Calvados and Mirabelle, it was found that both grape brandies contained significant amounts of 1,1-diethoxy-2-methylpropane, 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, 4-methylpentanol, and (Z)-and (E)-whiskey lactones. Cognac is more likely to be present than in Armagnac, potentially due to differing distillation protocols. Armagnac is distilled once using a column still, while Cognac undergoes double distillation using a pot still. The second distillation step may play a role in altering the flavor profile of the brandy. It is suggested that the two distillations of Cognac contribute to higher levels of furan substances, including furfuryl ethyl ether, furfural, 2-acetylfuran, and 5-methylfurfural.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52014, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The factors influencing the aroma in brandy include the raw material and the processing (Y. P.). The factors that influence the raw material include the environment in which the grapes are cultivated, the grape variety and the ripeness of the grapes, with the grape variety having a significant impact on the flavor of the brandy. While Cognac is produced from grapes of the legally recognized varieties in specific appellations, Ugni Blanc is the most dominant approved grape variety used to produce Cognac, with 98% planting coverage. Originally from Italy, Ugni Blanc is naturally immune to gray mold. It has lower tannin and volatile acid content, higher total acidity, resulting in a softer and more harmonious brandy with a distinct fruitiness. In addition to Ugni Blanc, the remaining noted grape varieties are Colombard, Folle Blanche, S\u00e9millon, Montils and Folignan. Grapes suitable for cognac production must have properties of high yields and resistance to disease, low sugar levels and high acidity, grapes with mild or neutral aromas with no prominent or aggressive aromas and strong anti-oxidation properties. Colombard brandy is richer in grassy and herbaceous aromas than Ugni blanc; For the production process, the fermentation process, the distillation conditions and, most crucially, the maturing conditions all have a impact on the quality of brandy. Esters, alcohols, acids and carbonyl compounds, which are mainly generated during the fermentation and distillation stages and to a lesser extent during the maturing process. Pyrazine (cocoa aroma) and furan compounds (caramel aroma) can be higher in brandy distillates. The quality of Cognac is often appreciated only after several years of maturation. The maturing process generates dried fruit, balsamic, woody and spicy aromas. During maturation the solvent and fruity notes of the young brandy are gradually replaced by the plummy notes of the aged brandy and a more harmonious woody, vanilla description. Terpenoids contribute significantly to the sensory perception of aged brandy in synergy with \u03b2-damascenone and oak lactones (.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 54126, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Whiskey", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 54134, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Whiskey is a distilled liquor obtained from grains, such as malted wheat or cereal, which are soaked and germinated in water, then mashed and distilled to obtain wort through saccharification. It is then fermented with yeast, distilled twice, aged, and blended in oak casks. Whiskey produced in Scotland, Ireland, USA, Canada, etc. There are generally three kinds of products including malt whiskey, grain whiskey, and blended whiskey, and malt whiskey is further divided into two categories: blended malt whiskey and single malt whiskey(Poisson & Schieberle, 2008b). developed 35 descriptive terms to describe the odor, flavor perception, and aftertaste in 1979. Lee et al.developed an updated flavor wheel to support the sensory evaluation of the sensory properties of whiskey. More than 1000 compounds have been identified in whiskey, including higher alcohols, esters, carbonyl compounds and lactones, as well as sulfur-containing, nitrogen-containing compounds and volatile phenols. Some Scotches whiskey are characterized by the utilization of burning peat to roast the malt, which fully absorbs the \u201cpeaty\u201d smoke and delivers a unique smoky smell to Scotch whiskey. It was demonstrated that peat from different regions offered different flavors to Scotch whiskey by pyrolyzing peat from different regions. Peat pyrolysates are abundant in phenols compounds, hydrocarbon derivatives, aromatic compounds and nitrogenous compounds. Volatile phenols are the most important aroma-active compounds in peat whiskey, such as guaiacol with aromas attributes described as aromatic, phenols, vanilla, woody, bacony, savory, smoky and medicinal; and lilac alcohol with aromas attributes described as aromatic, phenols, spicy, smoky, bacony, sweet, medicinal, creamy, meaty and herbal. These phenols are mainly formed by the degradation of hemicellulose and lignin. The main odors of peat-treated single malt whiskey were identified with 20 compounds revealed, having FD factors ranging from 8 to 2048, eight of which were volatile phenols. Besides, odorants with the highest FD factors were guaiacol, 4-ethylguaiacol, 4-methylphenol, 4-vinylguaiacol and 4-ethyl-2-methylphenol. Lactones are likewise regarded as one of the essential odorants in whiskey, with a pleasant aroma and low threshold values. Commonly, lactones in malt whiskey are oak lactone and \u03b3-nonalactone. All whiskies contain considerable amounts of \u03b3-nonalactone. Certain lactones, such as \u03b3-decalactone and \u03b3-dodecalactone contribute sweet and fatty flavors to malt whiskey. Lactones also generally originated from oak casks and accumulate during the maturing process. Pyridines, pyrazines and thiazines are reputed to make a substantial contribution to the sensory properties of whiskey. Generally, pyrazines are associated with pleasant baked food which are usually marked by descriptors such as burnt, roasted and nutty(Nicolotti et al., 2019). Note of nutty, green and roasted have been utilized to describe thiazoles, which themselves are thought to smell like pyridines, and the characteristics of pyridines found in whiskey are described as astringent, green, hazelnut, earthy, buttery, caramel, rubbery, roasted, fatty and bitter. In sensory evaluation, the odor and taste of whiskey improve with decreasing levels of pyridine. Several aldehydes and alcohols have been shown to contribute to malt whiskey \u201cgreen\u201d aroma attributes, such as (E,Z)-2,6-nonenal, (E)-2-nonenal, 1-octen-3-ol, 4-hepten-1-ol and nonan-2-ol. Certain sulfur-containing compounds can impart undesirable notes to whiskey, but maturation can enhance the flavor profile. Some sulfur-containing substances, including dimethyl sulfide, 3-(methylthio) propyl acetate, dihydro-2-methyl-3(2H)-thiophenone and ethyl 3-(methylthio) propanoate, decreased rapidly during aging period and may disappeared within three years. It is speculated that dimethyl disulphide may be formed during distillation process through the interaction of copper.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 58126, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Vodka", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 58132, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Vodka is a distilled liquor produced by fermenting raw materials, distilling to produce alcohol, degrading it with water, and purifying it by slow filtration through birch charcoal, without maturing.

Activated carbon-based adsorption can effectively eliminate some harmful compositions in the liquor and cause impurities such as formaldehyde and methanol, enabling vodka to formulate colorless, neutral, pure, gentle and sweet sensory properties. The optimal alcohol concentration in vodka is at 40% v/v, as this was the best ratio of hydrogen bonding between ethanol and water molecules.

In the manufacturing process of vodka, the quality of water is quite crucial. The hardness, alkalinity, and pH of the softened water used need to meet certain standards, otherwise the increased content of calcium, magnesium, or other compounds over time can lead to instability or precipitation. The taste of vodka has the purest of the six distilled liquors, with virtually no other impurities than alcoholic aromas. The liquid\u2013liquid extraction method that commonly used to extract aromas in liquors had been reported to be inefficient in extracting trace components in vodka, what\u2019s more, multiple extractions of a large batch of samples were carried out to increase the enrichment factor, and it was showed that SPME, known for its simplicity and high enrichment capacity, was an ideal technique for trace analysis of vodka. applied SPME-GC\u2013MS to analyze the highest concentrations of compounds in vodka as heteroalcohols, mainly isoamyl alcohol (both 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol) and propanol. Carbonyl compounds negatively affect the sensory properties of vodka. In particular, certain aldehydes such as propinalp, pentanal, isoamyl aldehyde, hexanal and 2-butenal, which could have a negative impact on the flavor of vodka even at low concentrations. In addition, carbonyl compounds, due to their electrophilic properties, readily react with biological nucleophilic reagents containing amines and sulfur groups (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids or cell membranes) to produce many substances suspected to be carcinogenic. Especially formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and unsaturated aldehydes (propionaldehyde and 2-butenal), whose low concentrations and complex matrices lead to inaccurate determination of carbonyl compounds in vodka (Sowi\u0144ski et al., 2005).

Rum is indigenous to Cuba and is a traditional Sugarcane liquor in many Caribbean and West Indies countries such as Brazil and Jamaica (H. F.). Several styles of rum have been exploited globally, including white, dark, amber, over-proof and spiced rums, depending on the ageing time and process. White rums, also termed as \u201csliver\u201d, \u201clight\u201d or \u201cclear\u201d rum, are matured for 1\u20132\u00a0years after distillation and filtered through activated charcoal, the manufacturing process resulted in a lighter taste and pale in color, which is generally used in cocktails rather than neat. Dark rums are aged for two years in charred oak barrels, with a certain darker color. Amber or gold rums are matured in charred oak barrels for 18\u00a0months, and are allowed to age with some caramel toner to bring the rum to a standard color(J. A.). Over-proofed rum is the most popular rum in the Caribbean Islands market and is commonly used to formulate rum-based cocktails. Spiced rums are infused with spices during the mixing stage, such as cinnamon, anise, ginger, rosemary, or pepper.

Pino. As it reported, 184 compounds were identified in rum using SPME combined with GC\u2013MS, which revealed that it was possible to differentiate between 3 and 7\u00a0year aged rums using only 15 volatile compounds (J. A.). Besides, 19 aroma active compounds with OAVs\u00a0greater than\u00a01 were identified in rum (J. A.). A follow-up study showed that 19 potential aroma active compounds (FD factors ranged from 8 to 1024) were considered as key odorants of commercial rums aged 3, 7, 10 and 15\u00a0years, screening raw spirit, wood, vanilla, fruity, dry fruity, caramel to describe the sensory properties of rums (J. A.). The aroma of a 3-year aged rum is considered to be typically primal (raw alcoholic), and the rum will tend to have more woody and dried fruit aromas with increasing duration of aging. Cis-oak lactones and vanillin are probably the key aroma contributors for aged rums. Fatty acid ethyl esters are thought to provide fruity aromas to rums (J.), including ethyl-2-methylpropanoate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, 3-methyl-1-butyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, and ethyl caprate. Besides, \u03b2-damascenone (a typical baked apple odor) and 5-methyl furfural (a caramel-like odor) may contribute to the dry fruit and caramel aromas in aged rums, respectively. Franitza, Granvogl, and Schieberle (2016) employed sensory omics analysis to the identification of rums. The results showed that odorants with the highest FD factors included cis-whiskey lactone, vanillin, caprynic acid and 2- and 3-methylbutanol, and vanillin, maltol, \u03b4-nonalactone, 4-vinylphenol and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol were then characterized as key odorants contributed to the \u201cmolasses aroma\u201d of rums. Rum has a high level of acetals, which ranking the highest among the brandy, whiskey, vodka and gin. The formation of acetals reduces the amount of free aldehydes generated in the distillate process, which facilitating the elimination the pungent odor and pungency caused by aldehydes (J. A.). Additionally, gallic acid, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, vanillic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, syringaldehyde, sinapaldehyde and coniferyl aldehydel have been reported several times as markers of aged rums, which are transferred from oak barrels to rums during the maturing process and are key factors in the sensory properties of rums. Chemometric methods (PCA, PLS-DA, LDA) were applied to model 44 rum samples from 15 different countries to distinguish between Cuban and non-Cuban rums. Nicolotti et al. (2019) developed a (HS-SPME-GCMS) based method for targeted and untargeted analysis, with 40 ions as relevant chemical descriptors corresponding to 13 discriminatory compounds, which allowed an efficient classification of 33 different commercial rums. applied high speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) full liquid chromatography combined with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn) to the separation and identification of phenols compounds in aged rums, indicating that aged rums are enriched in phenols. Since rum requires a long period of aging, researchers hope to use some artificial aging techniques to reduce the aging time cost without changing the flavor. Artificial aging techniques, using specially treated oak chips, was adapted to rum samples, and then samples with traditional aged rums were compared with those via artificial neural networks.

There are two alternative modes of gin production. One is a gin produced with moderate amounts of alcohol and natural or artificial flavoring permitted by regulations, called compound gin. The other is a distilled liquor made by fermenting and distilling grains such as barley or corn to obtain a grain distillate and then redistilling and blending gin and other botanical preparations with the grain distillate.

The distillation process is essential for the flavor and quality of gin. A novel distillation method with high vacuum distillation was proposed to better preserve the natural flavor of the botanical extracts, so as to produce a better quality gin. Gin can obtain the name of a geographical indication when it is produced in a specific geographical area and meets the relevant production, composition and quality requirements, for example, the Plymouth Gin (United Kingdom). Specifically, London dry gin refers to a specific craft liquor that can originate from any source, while Plymouth Gin reflects the geographical origin of the gin. It has been noted that there are differences in the terpene composition of geographical indication gin from London dry gin. The odorants of gin are mainly terpenes. had identified a total of 77 volatile compounds in gin using solvent distillation extraction (SDE) combined with HS-SPME method in 2007, with monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes accounting for more than 80% of the volatile components, among which oxygenated monoterpenes (31.2%), monoterpenes (29.9%), sesquiterpenes (22%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (5.2 %). Vichi et al.further identified 10 diterpene components in gin. The main monoterpenes detected in gin were \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-myrcene, limonene, and \u03b3-terpene, while limonene and \u03b3-terpene are important aroma substances of citrus essential oils (, 2007).

It has also been suggested that the enantiomeric ratio of linalool and cis-linalool oxides can distinguish gins of different geographical indications. Sesquiterpenes are usually woody and have a high aroma threshold, while the oxygenated sesquiterpenes identified in gin are all alcohol derivatives of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons.
