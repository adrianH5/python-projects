Subjects with DS show a typical phenotype marked by facial dysmorphisms and ID. Partial trisomy 21 (PT21) is a rare genotype characterized by the duplication of a delimited chromosome 21 (Hsa21) portion and it may or may not be associated with DS diagnosis. The highly restricted Down syndrome critical region (HR-DSCR) is a region of Hsa21 present in three copies in all individuals with PT21 and a diagnosis of DS. This region, located on distal 21q22.13, is 34 kbp long and does not include characterized genes. The HR-DSCR is annotated as an intergenic region between KCNJ6-201 transcript encoding for potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 6 and DSCR4-201 transcript encoding Down syndrome critical region 4. Two transcripts recently identified by massive RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and automatically annotated on Ensembl database reveal that the HR-DSCR seems to be partially crossed by KCNJ6-202 and DSCR4-202 isoforms. KCNJ6-202 shares the coding sequence with KCNJ6-201 which is involved in many physiological processes, including heart rate in cardiac cells and circuit activity in neuronal cells. DSCR4-202 transcript has the first two exons in common with DSCR4-201, the only experimentally verified gene uniquely present in Hominidae. In this study, we performed in silico and in vitro analyses of the HR-DSCR. Bioinformatic data, obtained using Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and SRA-BLAST software, were confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing on a panel of human tissues.

After chromosome 22, Hsa21 was the second human chromosome whose sequence was determined. To date, Hsa21 is the human chromosome with the lowest number of genes; it has 228 known protein-coding and 106 non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene).

PT21 is characterized by the duplication of only a segment of Hsa21 that may or may not be associated with DS diagnosis. Since the early \u201870s, numerous attempts have been made to understand which segments of Hsa21 present in triplicate are responsible for the phenotype of DS. Briefly, after the development of chromosomal banding techniques, many articles have described the presence of 3\u00a0G regions on the distal half of the long arm (21q22) of Hsa21 in PT21 subjects with DS phenotype. At the same time, the absence of the syndrome was reported in PT21 subjects where the short arm (21p) and the proximal part of the long arm (21q21) were present in three copies. These results indicate a relationship between the 21q22 region and DS phenotype, while 21p and 21q21 resulted not essential for the development of DS pathogenesis. In 1974, Niebuhr and coll. reviewed 14 previously described cases of PT21 subjects and identified a region of 17.4\u00a0Mb in 21q22 locus that is needed to manifest DS. The limits of 17.4\u00a0Mb region were further restricted thanks to the analysis of other PT21 cases that allowed the identification of the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR). Systematic attempts were then published in 2009 to identify \u201ccritical regions\u201d on Hsa21 for several distinct phenotypes observed in DS. A systematic reanalysis of all described cases of PT21 from 1973 to 2019 was performed rather than trying to identify subregions responsible for distinct phenotypes, we focused on the diagnosis of DS implying its most common clinical findings: a recognizable form of intellectual disability (ID) and typical DS facies. It was demonstrated that the presence of a highly restricted Down syndrome critical region (HR-DSCR) of only 34\u00a0kb located on distal 21q22.13 from 37,929,229 to 37,963,130 shared by all subjects with PT21 and with diagnosis of DS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4692, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The HR-DSCR sequence was conserved during evolution in the Hominidae family, suggesting a role in the development of higher brain function.
