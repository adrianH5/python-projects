The sequencing data in FASTQ format was then mapped against NCBI build 37.2 of the human genome using Bowtie 2 (version 2.1.0.0). RNA sequencing metrics were obtained using Picard tools (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) (see Table 1 in). Spliced junctions were identified using Tophat (version 2.0.8) and transcript abundance estimates were performed using Cufflinks (version 2.1.1). EdgeR was used to perform differential gene expression analysis between samples with different pigmentation levels (see Table 5 in). Genes differentially expressed were considered significant if they had a FDR adjusted p-value<0.05. For the isoform analysis we imported the Cufflinks isoform expression data of lightly and darkly pigmented HEMs into Microsoft Excel. Using Excel functions we identified the isoforms only present in HEM-L or HEM-D and excluded those with high degree of variability (standard error mean>35% the average FPKM).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5102, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5113, "infons": {"comment": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2014.09.010, in press", "name_0": "surname:Haltaufderhyde;given-names:K.D.", "name_1": "surname:Oancea;given-names:E.", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Genomics", "type": "ref", "year": "2014"}, "text": "Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of human epidermal melanocytes", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5179, "infons": {"fpage": "R25", "name_0": "surname:Langmead;given-names:B.", "name_1": "surname:Trapnell;given-names:C.", "name_2": "surname:Pop;given-names:M.", "name_3": "surname:Salzberg;given-names:S.L.", "pub-id_pmid": "19261174", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Genome Biol.", "type": "ref", "volume": "10", "year": "2009"}, "text": "Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5263, "infons": {"fpage": "1105", "lpage": "1111", "name_0": "surname:Trapnell;given-names:C.", "name_1": "surname:Pachter;given-names:L.", "name_2": "surname:Salzberg;given-names:S.L.", "pub-id_pmid": "19289445", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Bioinformatics", "type": "ref", "volume": "25", "year": "2009"}, "text": "TopHat: discovering splice junctions with RNA-Seq", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5313, "infons": {"fpage": "511", "lpage": "515", "name_0": "surname:Trapnell;given-names:C.", "name_1": "surname:Williams;given-names:B.A.", "name_2": "surname:Pertea;given-names:G.", "name_3": "surname:Mortazavi;given-names:A.", "name_4": "surname:Kwan;given-names:G.", "name_5": "surname:van Baren;given-names:M.J.", "name_6": "surname:Salzberg;given-names:S.L.", "name_7": "surname:Wold;given-names:B.J.", "name_8": "surname:Pachter;given-names:L.", "pub-id_pmid": "20436464", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Nat.
