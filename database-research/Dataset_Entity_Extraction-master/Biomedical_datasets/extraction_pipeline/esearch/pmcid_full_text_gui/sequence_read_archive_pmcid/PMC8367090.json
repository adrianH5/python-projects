Here, we identified an essential role for primary somatosensory cortical (S1) glutamate neuronal DNA methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in the transgenerational transmission of pain. In a female mouse chronic pain model, the offspring displayed significant pain sensitization. In these mice, MeCP2 expression was increased in S1 glutamate (GluS1) neurons, correlating with increased neuronal activity. Downregulation of GluS1 neuronal MeCP2 in maternal mice with pain abolished offspring pain sensitization, whereas overexpression of MeCP2 in na\u00efve maternal mice induced pain sensitization in offspring. Notably, single-cell sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the expression of a wide range of genes was changed in offspring and maternal GluS1 neurons, some of which were regulated by MeCP2. These results collectively demonstrate the putative importance of MeCP2 as a key regulator in pain transgenerational transmission through actions on GluS1 neuronal maladaptation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1191, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1204, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide.

Of note, very few types of pain follow the Mendelian transmission model because mutations leading to abnormal pain perception occur in under 1% of the population. In fact, a single gene change causing a major impairment in nociception is rare in nature. Thus, a genetic mutation hypothesis cannot generally explain the transgenerational transmission of pain phenotypes to offspring. Rather, a summation of small differences in multiple genes is supposed to cause most variations in pain perception. Therefore, the possibility is raised that non-genomic factors, such as epigenetic regulation, might be involved in fine controlling of a population of gene-transcriptional activity in offspring to confer pain phenotypes.

Consistent with this notion, we found 35 of 54 offspring suffered from pain from 54 parents with chronic low back pain. Although this sample was limited, the rate (\u224865 %) was higher than the reported pain heritability of 16\u201350 %. The reason is likely due to different pain intensities in the experimental participants. In this study, the pain subjects, who have to be hospitalized, were recruited from a pain clinic, suffering from severe pain (more than five years). This may lead to the pain outcome being greater than those used in large-scale epidemiological studies. In animals, the offspring from maternal mice with chronic pain, but not paternal mice, displayed significant pain sensitization. This is consistent with human studies in that the prevalence of chronic pain was higher in women than in men. Previous studies have found that the associations between parental chronic pain and psychological symptoms in children may depend on the sex and age of the child as well as parental sex. For example, mothers with chronic pain report more physical and psychological problems than children of fathers with chronic pain, and girls seem to be more vulnerable to the influence of maternal pain. This proposes that paternal germline effects, which could be produced under persistent pain conditions presented in the current study, are usually overridden by maternal effects. Thus, females are predicted to dynamically adjust their reproductive investment in response to environmental factors, with consequences for offspring brain and behavioral development. In particular, this pain phenotype was also exhibited in the second generation, suggesting that this effect could be termed a transgenerational transmission. Due to the limited experimental amenability of studies in humans, this mouse model can provide a new platform to investigate the potential mechanism underlying the transgenerational transmission of chronic pain.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45114, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The primary somatosensory cortex, as a critical brain site in pain signal processing, is activated in patients with multiple types of chronic pain. In our human fMRI study, S1 was activated in chronic pain offspring as well, suggesting a shared brain area in both offspring and parental pathological pain. On a cellular level, the adaptive GluS1L2/3 neuronal hyperactivity programmed by the chronic pain maternal lineage appears to be imprinted in their offspring. This could lead to spontaneous pain or sensitization to pain environments, such as inflammation and neural injury, in offspring. In addition, pain has been considered as an inherent stressor. It has been shown that maternal stress experience is a risk factor for fetal brain development, which often exhibits a sex bias. In this aspect, the molecular mechanism has been extensively investigated, but is still poorly understood. The evidence from the current study suggests that maternal GluS1L2/3 neuronal im-printing reprogrammed by chronic pain is passed to the offspring and correlates to the pain phenotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46191, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Mutation-caused pain hypersensitivity is quite rare, which is incompatible with the high rate of pain in offspring. Hence, we propose a hypothesis for an epigenetic mechanism of pain transgenerational transmission. MeCP2, as a transcriptional repressor or activator by recognizing epigenetic states (e.g., methylated DNA and chromatin conformation), plays a crucial role in the underlying pathogenesis of chronic pain. A previous study has shown that 75 % of MeCP2-caused Rett Syndrome patients have an abnormal pain response. In animal pain models, the current study also demonstrates that GluS1L2/3 neuronal MeCP2 is both necessary and sufficient for the transgenerational transmission of pain. Our data have not yet supported a germline passage of epigenetic modification. It is equally possible that maternal chronic pain may change the development of the female offspring, leading to chronic pain manifestation; since the offspring have chronic pain, their chronic pain factors can again pass to the next generation. This could mimic chronic visceral pain that develops developmental after neonatal insults, except that such insults are delivered from mothers with chronic pain. This can also explain why paternal factors have less impact on offspring.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47449, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given that dysfunction of MeCP2 alters synaptic plasticity, an immediate question is which and how these genes were involved. We found that 102 genes in the GluS1L2/3 neuronal transcriptional profiles are simultaneously changed in both maternal and offspring mice with pain compared with their controls. This suggests that maternal chronic pain would more likely affect transcriptional patterns, rather than a single candidate gene. This raises the possibility that these pain-related genes for pain regulation were conserved, and their dysfunction would be passed to offspring. Although the role of these genes was not extensively investigated in the current study, previous studies have shown that many of these genes such as the typical pain-related genes C1qb, Tec, Cpq, Epha and Mafb modulate synaptic plasticity and pain behaviors. Among these genes, the MeCP2 binding pattern on their promoters is changed under persistent pain conditions. It is generally thought that for most genes, an epigenetic \u201cclean slate\u201d is started after conception by total reprogramming, whereas a small minority of genes possesses epigenetic tags, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, surviving the reprogramming process. Thus, the maternal germline epigenetic changes on a population of gene transcriptional zones have been proposed to be possibly inherited in the F2 generation in multiple species. Supporting this notion, our data from single-cell RNA-seq and ChIP further demonstrate the roles of these MeCP2-medited pain-related genes. Certainly, we cannot exclude the importance of a single gene in the transgenerational transmission of pain, such as the MeCP2 gene itself.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49131, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49154, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Declaration of Competing Interest", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49188, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors declare no competing financial interests.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49242, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "All data necessary to understand and assess the conclusions of this study are available in the main text.
