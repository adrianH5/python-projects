Indeed, G/C dinucleotides are predicted to be most favorable for nucleosome formation in vitro but not in vivo. Nucleosome sequence read coverage in vivo is distinctly lower in chromosome arms than in central regions; the observed changes in apparent nucleosome sequence specificity, likely due to genome-wide chromatin remodeler activity, contribute to the formation of these megabase-scale chromatin domains.

The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle \u2013 147 base pairs (bps) of DNA wrapped in a left-handed superhelix around each histone octamer. Nucleosome positioning strongly affects gene regulation and other vital functions such as cell replication and DNA repair, both by occluding functional elements (transcription factor binding sites, splicing signals, etc.) and by recruiting chromatin remodeling, regulatory and transcriptional machinery through association with histones and nucleosome-packaged DNA. The strength of this association is often modulated by a combinatorial array of post-translational histone tail modifications, including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Thus understanding the relative role of various factors that define nucleosome positions in living cells is a challenging task.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3243, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of these factors is DNA itself \u2013 direct measurements of histone-DNA binding affinities have established that changes to DNA sequence can vary the energy of nucleosome formation by as much as 2\u20133 kcal/mol, although typical differences in energy between two randomly picked genomic nucleosomal sequences are expected to be smaller. These studies have also probed the rules that control histone-DNA binding affinity, focusing in particular on the 10\u201311 bp periodic dinucleotide motifs commonly found in high-affinity nucleosomal sequences. The 10\u201311 bp periodicity helps minimize the cost of bending a 147 bp-long DNA molecule into the nucleosomal superhelix by placing G/C dinucleotides where the major groove is compressed (i.e., the minor groove faces away from the surface of the histone octamer) and A/T dinucleotides where the minor groove is compressed (i.e., faces toward the histone octamer). More recently, genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed that nucleosomes simply tend to occupy G/C-enriched and A/T-depleted sites. The G/C dinucleotide content in stable nucleosomes reconstituted in vitro increases towards the dyad, and was found to be elevated in nucleosomes and depleted in linkers in several in vitro and in vivo assays. The relative contribution of increased G/C content vs. 10\u201311 bp periodic motifs to the free energy of nucleosome formation is currently unknown. It is possible that the MNase-based experimental procedure used to isolate mononucleosomes leads to enrichment in GC content.

Since free energies required to displace a nucleosome are of the order of several kcal/mol, they are readily available in the cell, for example through the process of ATP hydrolysis utilized by a number of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Nucleosome positions can also be modified in vivo through chromatin fiber formation which tends to constrain linker DNA lengths, and through direct competition with non-histone DNA-binding factors. Previous studies in Saccharomyces cerevisae have compared chromatin assembled in vitro on genomic DNA fragments (where, apart from potential subtle effects related to folding into higher-order structures, nucleosome positions are dictated solely by intrinsic sequence preferences and steric exclusion) with chromatin extracted from living cells. These studies have shown that although bulk nucleosomes are not strongly sequence-specific, models trained on in vitro data can predict a subset of in vivo nucleosomes occupying intrinsically favorable sites. It is unclear to what extent this conclusion can be transferred to complex metazoan organisms with multiple cell types, where nucleosome occupancy may be more strongly affected by chromatin remodelers and formation of large-scale chromosomal domains. Furthermore, nucleosome positioning is thought to play a major role in directing co-transcriptional splicing by demarcating metazoan exon-intron architecture.

These comprehensive high-resolution maps have enabled us to carry out a detailed analysis of deviations from intrinsic nucleosome positioning in living cells of a metazoan organism.

To create in vitro nucleosome positioning maps, high molecular weight C. elegans genomic DNA was digested into fragments by either Hinc II or Rsa I restriction enzyme and reconstituted into nucleosomes using recombinant histone octamers (Methods). In order to minimize potential biases due to end effects of short DNA fragments and steric hindrances due to neighboring nucleosome formation, nucleosomes were reconstituted on a well-defined restriction set of DNA fragments and at a high DNA-to-histone mass ratio. Assembled nucleosomes were treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and the mononucleosomal DNA was isolated and sequenced on an Illumina high-throughput sequence analyzer (Methods). The sequence reads were mapped to the WS190 C. elegans genome, creating two independent in vitro nucleosome coverage profiles which we will refer to as Hinc II and Rsa I maps, respectively. We observe that Rsa I and Hinc II sequence reads are enriched in the vicinity of their respective cut sites (as seen in Additional file 1: Figure S1, which shows average read counts near cut sites). This end effect is not observed in vivo (data not shown), and has a potential to introduce a bias into subsequent analysis of in vitro nucleosomal maps. The bias can be controlled by excluding the neighborhood around each cut site from further analysis, although the fraction of bps removed via this filter may be substantial depending on the neighborhood size (Methods). Nucleosome coordinates in the two in vivo maps produced by Fire and collaborators (referred to collectively as our in vivo maps or individually as Gu & Fire and Valouev et al. maps hereafter) are as previously reported.

Thus chromosomal arms are depleted of nucleosome reads relative to the central domain (Figure\u00a01A, Additional file 1: Figure S2 and Figure S3). The read coverage difference is more pronounced in autosomes but is also clearly visible in the X chromosome (Additional file 1: Figure S2 and Figure S3). One possible explanation is that in vivo nucleosome coverage is indeed lower in the arms. Another possibility is the differential recovery of sequence reads in the arms vs. central regions caused by distinct patterns of post-translational modifications, chromatin tertiary structure and histone variant usage that could affect the efficiency of MNase in producing mononucleosome fragments. In either case, our observations point to substantial differences in chromatin structure of arms and central regions. This depletion of sequence reads from chromosomal arms is not observed in vitro, where both Rsa I and Hinc II maps yield flat distributions (Figure\u00a01B, Additional file 1: Figure S2 and Figure S4). The pronounced depletion of sequence reads from terminal domains cannot be explained by the over-representation of repetitive sequences on the chromosomal arms in C. elegans, which would cause fewer nucleosomes to be mapped to such repetitive sequences both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the enrichment over the central region is not observed in a nucleosome-free control experiment in which C. elegans genomic DNA was digested by MNase (Additional file 1: Figure S2). The maximum number of mismatches allowed when sequence reads are mapped to the reference genome also does not appear to play a role since it was different in the two in vivo maps.

Furthermore, Ercan et al. employ formaldehyde crosslinking which could potentially alter chromatin structure. Finally, they use MNase digestion buffer with 110 mM NaCl vs. 15 mM NaCl in our in vivo experiments.

Ikegami et al. have shown that in C. elegans autosomes arms, but not central regions are enriched in LEM-2 and are thus associated with the nuclear lamina while only the left end of the X chromosome is attached to the nuclear membrane. Broad patterns of post-translational histone tail modifications also demarcate central and distal regions, indicating that their chromatin states are significantly different.

The models are called position-independent because they consider mono- and dinucleotide counts regardless of their locations within the nucleosomal site. Position-independent models have been shown to reproduce nucleosome occupancy profiles as efficiently as much more complex models that also take 10\u201311 bp dinucleotide periodicities into account. The fitting parameters of the models can be rigorously interpreted as mono- and dinucleotide energies under the assumption that nucleosome positioning is affected solely by steric exclusion and intrinsic histone-DNA sequence preferences. While we expect this to be true in our in vitro experiments (apart from the effects of chromatin fiber formation which tends to arrange nucleosomes in regular arrays, resulting in preferences for 10\u201311 bp discretized linker lengths), nucleosome positions in vivo are also affected by chromatin remodeling enzymes and competition with other DNA-binding proteins.

Their work showed that remodelers bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, and that SWI/SNF, CHD/MI2, and INO80 remodelers push nucleosomes onto low-affinity sites, while ISWI remodelers expel nucleosomes from high-affinity sites. As a result, all four remodelers tend to act against intrinsic nucleosome sequence preferences. Consequently, knocking down remodeler activity significantly improved agreement between nucleosome occupancy observed in vivo and occupancy predicted by sequence-specific models trained on in vitro data. Thus, chromatin remodelers can bias apparent nucleosome sequence preferences genome-wide. We infer that remodeling events involving single nucleosomes may contribute to creating large chromatin domains, megabases in size, in C. elegans.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28197, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We have also considered the possibility that changes in sequence preferences are due to localization to the nuclear membrane or direct competition with LEM-2, but this hypothesis is not supported by our data.

Ikegami et al. argued that chromosomal arms are associated with the nuclear membrane via interactions with subdomain regions, whereas intervening gap regions loop into the nucleus. So, if competition with LEM-2 or attraction to the nuclear membrane were responsible for decreased read coverage in arms, we would expect in vivo read coverage to be lower in LEM-2 subdomains than in gaps.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28974, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "However, we find the opposite trend. Additional file 1: Figure S10 shows histograms of average nucleosome occupancy in gaps, subdomains, and central chromosome regions where LEM-2 is depleted. We observe that in vivo read coverage in subdomains is significantly higher than in gaps. In the Gu & Fire data, the gaps have a mean normalized occupancy (Methods) of \u22120.14 with subdomains at \u22120.04; from Valouev et al., we find that occupancy in gaps averages to \u22120.14 while subdomains have a mean occupancy of \u22120.06.

As expected, the large LEM-2 gaps in the centers of each chromosome have high normalized occupancy in vivo (0.19 for Gu & Fire and 0.20 for Valouev et al.). On the other hand, Additional file 1: Figure S10 shows that gaps in the chromosomal arms tend to be more nucleosome-covered in vitro than subdomains, indicating that DNA sequences in gaps are intrinsically more amenable to nucleosome formation.

Indeed, nucleosome occupancy profiles predicted with a bioinformatics model trained on in vitro data from C. elegans and yeast are strongly correlated with the corresponding profiles predicted with the N\u2009=\u20092 position-independent model (Figure\u00a02B). For Rsa I and Hinc II datasets, shorter restriction fragments and regions around restriction enzyme cut sites were not filtered out as they do not appear to bias the fits. Similarly, a bioinformatics model trained on in vivo data from Gu & Fire exhibits strongest correlations with the predictions of the N\u2009=\u20092 position-independent models fit to our two in vivo datasets.

However, we do not see a strong correlation with either gene expression levels or splice site strength (Figure\u00a05E, Additional file 1: Figure S15), suggesting that the direct action of transcriptional and splicing machinery is not a major contributor to the exon-intron chromatin architecture. Rather, we surmise that the same mechanism is responsible for both large-scale sequence read depletion from chromosomal arms and small-scale sequence read depletion from exons with high G/C content.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 61045, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we have compared in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps in C. elegans to discover striking functional differences on multiple scales.
