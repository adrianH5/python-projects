Undoubtedly, the DLRN developed based on radiomics-deep learning phenotypes improved prediction after the Delong test and NRI calculation as in other similar studies. Then, potential biological pathways associated with LNM were revealed, with a special focus on typical signaling pathways as well as pathways for cell growth and death, immune response, cell communication, and signal transduction.

Even though DLR studies had combined deep learning and radiomics features, but there were still lack of studies on DLR biological characteristic analysis, which was the novelty of this study. First, multiple studies had analyzed the predictive value of deep learning and radiomics phenotypes, but ignored the interactions between the two and the variability of phenotypes quantified by different deep learning algorithms. This study both verified that radiomics and deep learning phenotypes offer complementary information and found an information overlap that increases the interpretability of deep learning phenotypes. In addition, most previous studies had used the VGG16 deep learning algorithm to extract image information. In contrast, this study used the GoogLeNet and ResNet50 deep learning algorithms and compared the differences in the information extracted by them. No difference was observed in the effectiveness of the models developed by these two deep learning phenotypes. Second, this study revealed the biological significance of deep learning radiomic phenotypes transferred with LNM based on radiogenomics. In contrast to similar studies, the biological significance of deep learning phenotypes was still poorly understood. Moreover, most radiogenomics studies had analyzed the biological significance represented by a large number of differentially expressed genes, but ignored the interactions between genes. This study mapped imaging phenotypes to gene modules based on WGCNA, which may enhance its reproducibility and interpretability.

Based on radiomic phenotypes and deep learning phenotypes from DCE-MRI images before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to predict pathological complete remission, the AUC reached 0.9. In this study, radiomics phenotypes seem to be more effective than deep learning phenotypes, similarly to previous studies. For example, based on the RF machine learning algorithm, the radiomics model exhibited better discrimination than the deep learning model (AUC, 0.86 vs. 0.79; accuracy, 0.78 vs. 0.73). The DLRN developed based on DLR phenotypes showed prediction results similar to those in previous studies. For the degree of information quantification of the images, this study quantified 1781 radiomics phenotypes, which was a larger amount compared to some previous studies. However, the thousands of deep learning phenotypes quantified based on GoogLeNet and ResNet50 were less informative compared to vgg16. In addition, for model evaluation, the Delong test and NRI/IDI calculations were used to double-validate the differences in the reliability of the different models, and NRI was found to suggest differences between models in the case of a negative Delong test. For example, the Delong test found no significant difference between the radiomics model and the GoogLeNet model, but the NRI found that the radiomics model improved the effect over the GoogLeNet model (P\u2009=\u20090.008).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 25943, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The relationship between image phenotypes and biological pathways has been shown in numerous studies, suggesting the possibility of observing cancer-related pathways in a non-invasive manner by DCE-MRI.

The inhomogeneous enhancement phenotypes of tumor-adjacent parenchyma in MR imaging were associated with tumor necrosis signaling pathways. However, there were still limited studies on the biological characteristics of imaging features related to LNM. For example, LNM was evaluated based on the deep learning features extracted from MRI images of 110 breast cancer patients, and the potential biological characteristics of deep learning features were analyzed, among which fatty acid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, phynylalanine metabolism, RNA degradation, and tyrosine metabolism were the first five related pathways. WGCNA has proven to be a useful tool for identifying gene modules in radiogenomic analysis of breast tumors, where MRI phenotypes were associated with seven gene modules, including two radiomics phenotypes and six GoogLeNet phenotypes in this study. Referring to previous studies, DLR phenotypes of tumor progression closely signaling pathways were analyzed, such as cell growth and death, immune response, cell communication, and signal transduction, and the results showed that image phenotypes were most closely related to immune response.
