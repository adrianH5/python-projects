In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, large-scale genomic studies have identified somatic mutations that affect tumor progression and the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Unfortunately, despite the large number of genetic markers currently constructed for the tumor microenvironment of kidney cancer and the good results they have achieved in prognosis prediction, their reliability and practical clinical application remain unconvincing; there are still major obstacles facing the use of multiple genetic markers in practical clinical application. Therefore, it is extremely important to identify the infiltration of TME and immune-related gene expression in ccRCC patients using non-invasive diagnostic methods.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28594, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Radiomics is different from the conventional perspective of image information interpretation, which uses high-level algorithms and advanced image processors. The fundamental problems facing radiomics toward clinical applications, such as the poor interpretability of extracted features and the inability of more advanced deep learning methods to explain them in a completely \u201cblack box,\u201d have not received much attention from researchers. In our study, we found that a radiogenomics marker based on genetic information from the TME can reflect profound alterations in immune-related gene expression. Their expression levels are closely correlated with a variety of immune cells, such as T cells, myeloid dendritic cells, and fibroblasts. In addition, there were significant correlations between the alterations and pathways such as tumor fibrosis and microvascular infiltration. This suggests that the novel radiogenomics marker we constructed could adequately reflect the various profound modifications of the TME. Few previous studies have reported the application of radiogenomics approaches for the non-invasive monitoring of TME. This gives our study a unique advantage, although this research approach needs to be supported by further experimental data. However, it also provides a fresh and dynamic methodological guide for the optimal combination of imaging and genomic data. However, it must also be acknowledged that a direct association between the immune microenvironment of ccRCC and the clinical prognosis of patients has not been confirmed by large-scale clinical data. Therefore, our study was based on transcriptomic data, and it aimed to assess immune-related gene expression in tumors in a non-invasive manner. This way, prognostic differences in tumors can be explained from an immunological perspective. Notably, some ccRCC patients often suffer from a coexisting disease with abnormal autoimmune system function, which may have a confounding effect on the ultimate predictive efficacy of immune-based prediction models. We therefore recommend that immune-related clinical treatment decisions and predictive models be considered with caution in such patients. In our work, we have incorporated some valid clinical and pathological factors in addition to immune-related genes in the hope of diluting the adverse effects on model prediction in this subset of patients.
