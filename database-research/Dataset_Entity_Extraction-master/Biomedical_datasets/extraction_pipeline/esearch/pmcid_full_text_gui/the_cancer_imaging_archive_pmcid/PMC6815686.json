First, tissue images capture much denser information than many other imaging methods. State-of-the-art digitising microscopes can scan a whole slide tissue at resolutions ranging from 30,000\u00d730,000 pixels to over 100,000\u00d7100,000 pixels. A whole slide tissue image can contain more than a million cells, nuclei, and other cellular-level structures. The sheer number of objects in a whole slide tissue image makes it impossible to manually segment and annotate each and every object. Second, there will be heterogeneity across tissue specimens and even within a tissue specimen. A whole slide tissue specimen may have multiple types of regions: normal tissue, tumour, stroma, etc. The development of representative datasets for machine/deep learning has to take into account heterogeneity. Third, tissue specimens go through a tissue processing phase before they are imaged. Variations in tissue preparation lead to artefacts in images, such as tissue folds, poor staining, and pen markings. In addition, there will be variations in image quality and characteristics, such as sharpness and colour profiles from different digitising microscopes. Even if images are obtained by the same digitising microscope, there can be artefacts such as out-of-focus or blurred regions. The image capture performance of a digitising microscope can degrade overtime and may need to be tuned at intervals. All these factors may lead to batch effects, i.e., images of the same tissue type coming from different source sites may have significant variations in colour, sharpness, etc. Consistent and unified protocols are necessary to reduce artefacts in image datasets used to generate training data. Lastly, there are no standard image file formats in digital pathology that are universally accepted, despite ongoing efforts. Almost every vendor in the digital pathology imaging domain has its own file format; there can even be variations between the file formats of different digitising microscopes from the same vendor. Libraries have been developed that can parse certain vendor formats. Tools and applications also have been developed to view and annotate pathology image data.
