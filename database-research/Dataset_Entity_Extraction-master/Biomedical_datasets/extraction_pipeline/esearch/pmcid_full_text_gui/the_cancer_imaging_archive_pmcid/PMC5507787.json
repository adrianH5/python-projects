Despite the continuous development of state-of-the-art analytic methods, un super vised hierarchical clustering probably remains the most basic and robust method and our results agree with the results of previous studies which performed similar an alyses. Since DNA microarray is not routinely performed in clinical practice, breast cancer subtypes are currently based on the immunohistochemical staining levels for the expression of the ER, PR, and HER2.

Nevertheless, even though the specific imaging features mentioned above were strongly related to a peculiar molecular subtype of breast cancer, cer tain clustered gene expression profiles may be associated with specific imaging features such as rim enhancement or hetero geneity of internal enhancement according to our results as well as prior studies. Since ERBB4, a gene correlated with aggressiveness mainly in triple-negative breast cancers, was one of the markedly underexpressed genes in group 2 in spite of triple-negative cancers being absolutely predominant in this group, we can hypothesize that an undiscovered intrinsic relationship might exist between gene expression char acteristics and imaging features.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 15080, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has several limitations.
