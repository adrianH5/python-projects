Sample entropy (SampEn) is commonly used for regularity analysis. However, it has limitations in processing short-term segments of HRV signals due to the extreme dependence of its functional parameters. We used the nonparametric sample entropy (NPSampEn) as a novel index for short-term HRV analysis in the case of OSA. The manuscript included 60 6-h electrocardiogram recordings (20 healthy, 14 mild-moderate OSA, and 26 severe OSA) from the PhysioNet database. The NPSampEn value was compared with the SampEn value and frequency domain indices. The empirical results showed that NPSampEn could better differentiate the three groups (p < 0.01) than the ratio of low frequency power to high frequency power (LF/HF) and SampEn. Moreover, NPSampEn (83.3%) approached a higher OSA screening accuracy than the LF/HF (73.3%) and SampEn (68.3%). Compared with SampEn (|r| = 0.602, p < 0.05), NPSampEn (|r| = 0.756, p < 0.05) had a significantly stronger association with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).

Traditionally, linear methods such as time and frequency domain analyses have been used to analyze OSA. The ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power (LF/HF) is the classic frequency domain index, which is considered to reflect the balance of the ANS. A higher LF/HF indicates that the sympathetic nerve is more active, and a lower LF/HF indicates that the parasympathetic nerve is more active.

Entropy methods have been widely used to identify subtle changes and complexities in HRV analysis. Classic nonlinear analysis methods including SampEn and fuzzy entropy have some advantages, but there are some limitations. On one hand, reference annotations are usually made for every minute with 60\u2013100 RR intervals to determine the presence or absence of apnea during the corresponding minute. Nevertheless, SampEn and fuzzy entropy have limitations in short-term HRV analysis for two reasons. The values of SampEn and fuzzy entropy are undefined when inappropriate parameters are selected such as an inappropriate r parameter. In addition, the values of SampEn and fuzzy entropy may not accurately reflect the complexity of the signal (Figure 3f). On the other hand, the SampEn and fuzzy entropy values depend on the selection of the parameter r, which is closely related to the standard deviation of the sequence. Nevertheless, the standard deviation can only reflect the fluctuation of the sequence integrally; it cannot fully reflect the subtle fluctuations when quantizing the template distance. In addition, r values that are too similar will lead to unnecessary redundancy in the values, and increase the computational expense, while this problem occurs with fuzzy entropy due to distance quantization. Therefore, NPSampEn was proposed for use in short-term data analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22393, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The results showed that NPSampEn (83.3%) significantly improved the OSA screening performance compared to SampEn (68.3%) and LF/HF (73.3%), and successfully quantified the severity of OSA (p < 0.05). Instead of the constant r value, the r solution of NPSampEn is defined based on the distances between the template vectors. The cumulative probability of the template distance determined by the set of r values can more accurately and precisely quantify the distribution of template distances in each region, and describe the signal fluctuation more specifically. The advantages of NPSampEn include its sensitivity to subtle fluctuations in signals, as the set of r values are defined by the unique template distance. As they constitute a set of adaptive values, the set of r values depends more on the dynamics of the signal and is less affected by the signal length. Therefore, NPSampEn is an adaptive method that is suitable for short-term sequences and fully reflects the fluctuations of sequences; furthermore, it can be used to overcome the influence of individual differences and identify the subtle fluctuations in physiological signals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23538, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.3.
