Therefore, traditional methods of EEG analysis may miss many properties inherent in such signals. Similarly, fractal analysis of EEG signals has shown scaling behaviors that may not be consistent with pure monofractal processes. In this study, we hypothesized that scalp-recorded human EEG signals may be better modeled as an underlying multifractal process. We utilized the Physionet online database, a publicly available database of human EEG signals as a standardized reference database for this study. Herein, we report the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis on human EEG signals derived from waking and different sleep stages, and show evidence that supports the use of multifractal methods. Next, we compare multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to a previously published multifractal technique, wavelet transform modulus maxima, using EEG signals from waking and sleep, and demonstrate that multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis has lower indices of variability. Finally, we report a preliminary investigation into the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis as a pattern classification technique on human EEG signals from waking and different sleep stages, and demonstrate its potential utility for automatic classification of different states of consciousness.

Direct recording of cortical neurons in animal cortices has provided convincing evidence for the presence of scale-free (self-affine) dynamics in the patterns of neuronal avalanches in cortical neurons. Indeed, neuronal avalanches recorded in the cortex were also found to correlate with beta/gamma band EEG recordings in rodents. Evidence of scale-free network activation has also been demonstrated utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. This experimental evidence collected on neuronal dynamics is matched by theoretical observations demonstrating that information networks operating at a \u201ccritical\u201d state (exhibiting scale-free or self-affine dynamics) tend to maximize information transmission.

This can be done by comparing results from multifractal analysis with a given time series with that from simulations from mono- and multifractal series (see Figure 1). MF-DFA results from human EEG are comparable to those from known multifractal processes, and appear to have a larger degree of multifractality than known monofractal processes (Figure 1; also cf.). Recent calculations of the degree of finite-size effects to be expected in multifractal spectrum calculations for non-multifractal processes also support these results, in that we see a larger degree of multifractality than expected by finite-size effects alone. Taking into account the results presented here, results from previously published data, and results from numerical simulations, these data support the hypothesis that human EEG can be successfully modeled as a multifractal process, which may provide additional insight into changes in brain neuronal dynamics associated with pathological states.

Our results reported here suggest that MF-DFA may be more consistent than WTMM in terms of having a lower variance for parameters determined from multifractal spectral data for shorter recordings (30 s, or 7500 data points at 256 Hz, Figure 2A), but being roughly consistent with WTMM for longer (8 m) recordings (Figure 2B). These results are supported by previous reports showing that MF-DFA produces less overall variability than WTMM in other model systems as well, particularly with smaller data sets. Therefore, MF-DFA may be superior to WTMM in detecting changes in neuronal dynamics underlying changes of consciousness or perception via EEG in shorter recordings of \u223c30 s. However, it is interesting to note that while both techniques give similar results for a given EEG time series, they are certainly not identical (Figure 3).
