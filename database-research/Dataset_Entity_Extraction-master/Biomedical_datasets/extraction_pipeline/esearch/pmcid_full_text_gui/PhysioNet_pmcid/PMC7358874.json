According to the World Health Organization, every year about 15 million (from 5% to 18% across 184 countries) infants are preterm and this number is rising (\"World Health Organization, 2018\"). Moreover, preterm birth complications are among the first causes of demise among under 5\u2010year\u2010old children (\"World Health Organization, 2018\"). Despite of this, preterm infants (PTI) have not been so much studied until now and knowledge about developmental biology and disease phenomena is still limited (Engle et al., 2007). PTI are physiologically immature and compensatory responses to the extrauterine environment are reduced if compared with term infants; for this reason, their morbidity and mortality risks are higher (Engle et al., 2007).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2640, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among other diseases, PTI have higher risk of developing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) than infants born at term (Rohana, Ishak, & Wan Nurulhuda, 2018; Thompson & Mitchell, 2006). SIDS was formalized about 50\u00a0years ago and is defined as the sudden death of an apparently healthy infant under 1\u00a0year that cannot be explained despite investigations, including autopsy, death scene examination, and knowledge of the infant's clinical history (Haas, 2018; Randall, Thompson, & Wilson, 2019; Rohana et al., 2018). SIDS is considered among the first causes of death during infancy (Kojima et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the exact mechanism underlying SIDS remains obscure and its etiology is likely multifactorial (Idriss, Van Hare, Fink, & Rosenbaum, 2002; Rohana et al., 2018; Schwartz et al., 1998). Apart from risk factors linked to infant living habits and parental practices (like way of sleeping or exposure to cigarette smoking), anamnestic data (like prematurity or low weight at birth), physiological abnormalities (like abnormalities of the central nervous system, abnormalities of the respiratory system, abnormalities of the cardiovascular system, or a combination of them) have been accounted as the main causes for the onset of this disease (Idriss et al., 2002; Rohana et al., 2018).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3940, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Studies on cardiac causes for SIDS have been focused on arrhythmia vulnerability attributable to repolarization instability (Idriss et al., 2002). At birth, cardiac electrophysiologic function is typically not complete (Idriss et al., 2002) and the dynamics of cardiac repolarization is altered with respect to adults (Idriss et al., 2002; Kojima et al., 2018; Pishva & Khosrojerdi, 2003). For example, it has been observed that QT variability may serve as an index of the maturity of the cardiac autonomic nervous system and myocardial depolarization (Kojima et al., 2018), while QT dispersion may be used as a prognostic factor for estimation of neonatal mortality (Pishva & Khosrojerdi, 2003). Few experimental studies on animals have suggested that repolarization alterations at birth may also manifest as T\u2010wave alternans (TWA) (Idriss & Bell, 2008; Idriss et al., 2002), a phenomenon consisting in the beat\u2010to\u2010beat fluctuation of JT morphology in the electrocardiogram (ECG) at stable heart rate. Often, TWA occurs at microvolt level, and thus, it is not visible at the naked eye so that computerized approaches are needed for its identification (Bini & Burattini, 2013; Burattini, Bini, & Burattini, 2009, 2010). TWA is widely studied in adult ECG due to its link with severe ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death (Rosenbaum, Albrecht, & Cohen, 1996). TWA in children is much less studied, and its interpretation is still far from being established (Idriss & Bell, 2008; Idriss et al., 2002; Makarov & Komoliatova, 2010; Makarov et al., 2010). For aught we know, only a couple of studies have analyzed TWA in human infant ECG (Makarov & Komoliatova, 2010; Makarov et al., 2010). In 2010, Makarov et al. (2010) analyzed TWA in twenty apparently healthy newborns in the first, second, and fourth day after birth and observed a peak level of TWA in the second day, possibly reflecting a restructuring of heart activity in the developing heart (in any case, TWA never exceeded 55\u00a0\u00b5V). According to Madias (2010), TWA changes in these newborns may be linked to changes in the T\u2010wave amplitude and do not necessarily reflect propensity to malignant ventricular arrhythmias (Madias, 2010). As far as we know, there is no study in literature about TWA on PTI. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to identify and quantify TWA in PTI and to evaluate association of TWA with infants\u2019 clinical features at birth and with other ECG features that have been found or assumed to be associated to adult TWA (Burattini, Zareba, & Burattini, 2012; Hanna & Ahmed, 2013; Madias, 2007; Rashba et al., 2002; Zareba, Moss, Cessie, & Hall, 1994). The final purpose is to gain more insights into the TWA phenomenon in PTI and, in particular, to open an issue on the possibility of considering TWA in nonpathological PTI (and possibly in newborns in general) as a heart\u2010developing marker rather than an arrhythmias\u2010risk index.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6888, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "METHODS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6896, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Preterm Infant Population", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6922, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The study population was constituted by ten nonpathological PTI from the \u201cPreterm infant cardio\u2010respiratory signals database\u201d by Physionet (Gee, Barbieri, Paydarfar, & Indic, 2017; Goldberger et al., 2000). Data referred to the population were acquired and collected in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health care. PTI have a gestational age (GA) from 29 to 34 weeks (mean: 31 \u00b1 1\u00a0weeks, Table 1) and birth weight (BW) from 0.84 to 2.10\u00a0kg (mean: 1.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41\u00a0kg; Table 1). Consequently, GA/BW ratio (days/kg), indicating the correct infant growth with respect to gestational age, ranged from 108 to 251\u00a0days/kg. The infants could spontaneously breath and did not present any congenital or perinatal infection of the central nervous system, intraventricular hemorrhage of grade II or higher, and hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy. Hospitalization of the infants is justified by their condition of prematurity, which makes nursing daily monitoring necessary until their weight guarantees complete physical and physiological development, fundamental for an autonomous and risk\u2010free growth. A single channel of a three\u2010lead ECG signal was acquired (sampling frequency: 500\u00a0Hz; acquisition band\u2010pass cutoff frequencies: 0.5\u201355.0\u00a0Hz) when available from bedside patient monitors (Intellivue MP70, Philips Medical Systems) from 20.3 to 70.3\u00a0hr per infant.

Approximately, only the first available minute of each ECG recording was analyzed. Specifically, overlapping 30\u2010s ECG tracings were recursively extracted every second for 30 times, overall covering 60\u00a0s of ECG. In each extracted tracing, the central 64\u2010beat ECG window was considered for the analysis of TWA (Figure 1). Then, each ECG window was prefiltered with a band\u2010pass bidirectional 6th\u2010order Butterworth filter (cutoff frequencies: 0.8 and 35.0\u00a0Hz) to remove low\u2010frequency interferences due to respiration and the high\u2010frequency interferences due to power line. Baseline was estimated as a 3rd\u2010order spline interpolation of fiducial points sited 50\u00a0ms before R peaks and then subtracted (Burattini, Bini, & Burattini, 2011). Then, each ECG window was tested to assess its suitability for TWA analysis. Specifically, an ECG window was considered suitable for TWA analysis if characterized by a stable heart rate and good quality signal. Heart rate was considered stable if the standard deviation of the RR intervals was at most 10% the RR\u2010interval median value (Burattini et al., 2011). Instead, signal quality was considered good if there were at most 5 actual beats in the ECG window that needed to be replaced since poorly correlating (correlation coefficient <0.70) with the median beat, which was computed over all the beats included in the considered window (Burattini et al., 2011).

Technically, the HRAMF implementation consists of a 6th\u2010order bidirectional Butterworth band\u2010pass filter characterized by a passing band that is 0.12\u00a0Hz wide (Burattini et al., 2008) and centered at the specific f TWA of the analyzed ECG window (Figure 2).

T\u2010wave windowing was performed using and adapted version of the experimental formulae previously proposed for adults (Burattini, Zareba, & Moss, 1999). Specifically, T\u2010wave onset is located 36\u00a0ms, 60\u00a0ms, and 90\u00a0ms after the R peak if RR\u00a0<\u00a00.36\u00a0s, 0.36\u20130.66\u00a0s, and\u00a0>\u00a00.66\u00a0s, respectively; T\u2010offset is located basing on T\u2010wave width, computed as . These formulas were obtained by considering that the heart rate of a premature infant (similarly to a fetus at the end of the gestational age) is, on average, half that of an adult (Marcantoni et al., 2018, 2017). A local estimate of TWA amplitude (ATWA; \u00b5V), associated with each single beat, is directly given by twice the TWA signal amplitude in correspondence of the T wave (Figure 2). In order to have TWA features globally representing all 64 beats in a window, mean value of the 64 ATWA values was computed, besides amount of accepted ECG windows (NW). Eventually, median values of mean TWA amplitude over the NW ECG windows recognized as suitable for TWA analysis was computed and indicated as TWAA (\u00b5V). If NW\u00a0<\u00a024 (80% of total windows), TWA analysis was considered unreliable, and the TWA identification procedure was repeated for the next following minute in the ECG tracing.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14040, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Additional electrocardiographic characterization", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14089, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The 1\u2010min ECG tracing used to perform TWA analysis was also characterized in terms of the following other common ECG features, which in adults were previously found or hypothesized to correlate with TWA (Burattini et al., 2012; Hanna & Ahmed, 2013; Madias, 2007; Rashba et al., 2002; Zareba et al., 1994) : median RR interval (RR, ms); median heart rate (HR, bpm); HRV (ms, measured as RR standard deviation); median T\u2010wave amplitude (TA, \u00b5V); median QRS\u2010complex duration (QRSD, ms); median QT\u2010interval duration (QT, ms); and median corrected QT\u2010interval duration (QTc, ms) computed according to Bazett's formula (Bazett, 1920).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14729, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Statistics", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14740, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Distribution of TWAA, clinical features at birth (GA, BW, and GA/BW) and additional ECG features (RR, HR, HRV, TA, QRSD, QT, and QTc) over the population were described in terms of mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation.

TWA in a population of ten nonpathological PTI. Such limited number is motivated by the deliberate selection of PTI without any comorbidity, who are statistically very difficult to obtain in clinical practice. In our PTI, TWA was evaluated in association with clinical features at birth and with additional ECG features that, in adults, are believed to be linked to TWA (Burattini et al., 2012; Hanna & Ahmed, 2013; Madias, 2007; Rashba et al., 2002; Zareba et al., 1994). The purpose is to gain some insights for better interpreting TWA in nonpathological PTI and, in particular, to open an issue about interpretation of TWA in nonpathological PTI as a heart\u2010developing marker rather than an arrhythmias\u2010risk index.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18913, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "TWA was detected using the HRAMF method (Burattini et al., 2008), a widely tested method that can adapt to any heart rate and has proved to be robust to physiological levels of HRV and to presence of noise and interferences (Burattini et al., 2009; Burattini et al., 2011). HRAMF has been recursively applied to 64\u2010beat ECG windows in order to minimize rejections due to presence of HRV. Additionally, only 1\u00a0min of ECG was analyzed (although recordings were much longer) to provide a procedure easily applicable also when only short ECG recordings are available. Analysis of time variability of TWA in PTI will be matter for future studies. Additionally, only one ECG lead was available, and consequently, being TWA a lead\u2010dependent phenomenon (Burattini, Man, Burattini, & Swenne, 2012), the obtained TWA measures possibly represent an underestimation of the phenomenon.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19791, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Use of the HRAMF method also avoid false\u2010positive TWA measurements possibly due to the presence of QRS alternans, as well as other interferences or noise occurring at the same frequency. Indeed, the HRAMF method performs a strict filtering around the alternans frequency (AF, defined as half heart rate) and provides an output signal, termed the TWA signal, which is a pseudo\u2010sinusoid. Successively, the procedure performs a check on the TWA signal to locate all its zero\u2010derivative points (maxima and minima). If the maxima and the minima occur in correspondence of the T waves, TWA is actually detected; differently, TWA is set to zero, but other kinds of alternans, such as QRS alternans, may occur. Maxima and minima positions correspond to the location of the center of mass of all alternans affecting any ECG wave, thus including TWA and QRS alternans (Marcantoni et al., 2020). For example, if TWA is dominant or is the only type of alternans present, maxima and minima will occur in correspondence of the T wave. If QRS alternans is dominant or it is the only type of alternans present, maxima and minima will occur in correspondence of the QRS complex. Eventually, if TWA and QRS alternans are both present and comparable, maxima and minima will occur in an intermediate position between T wave and QRS complex.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21118, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For the specific final goal of this study, we only focused on TWA amplitude quantification.

Levels of TWA affecting PTI are variable among subjects, similarly to what happens in adults (Burattini, Zareba, & Burattini, 2009, 2010) .", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21784, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our PTI population, TWA was found to decrease with BW (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.72, p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) and to increase with GA/BW (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.76, p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), thus indicating that TWA is higher in very small infants, especially when considering their weight in relation to their gestational age at birth. Additionally, TWA inversely correlated (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.71, p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) with HRV, which is known to be a sign of health but also of growth and maturity (specifically, reduced HRV is a symptom of a late development of the autonomic cardiac control) (Kojima et al., 2018); indeed, HRV represents the heart ability to adjust to varying conditions. These findings suggest that observed levels of TWA in nonpathological PTI may still indicate a condition of cardiac risk possibly related to the low development status of the infant (low BW and low HRV) and, thus, an indirect marker of heart developing. This conclusion is supported by the results of a comparison between TWA levels in our PTI against term healthy fetuses. Comparing TWA levels among studies is always very difficult because TWA measurements depend on the method used to obtain them (Bini & Burattini, 2013). Nevertheless, in a previous study on healthy fetuses (Marcantoni et al., 2018, 2017) TWA was quantified at birth by using the same exact procedure used here. The age at birth of these fetuses varied between 38 and 41\u00a0weeks of gestation; thus, they were actually older than the PTI analyzed here (Table 1). TWA values observed in term healthy fetuses were around 10\u00a0\u00b5V (9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b5V when measured in direct transvaginal ECG acquisitions and 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b5V in indirect abdominal ECG acquisitions), on average smaller than those observed in our PTI (Table 2). Thus, TWA seems to have the tendency to decrease with age at birth, finding that reinforces our hypothesis that observed levels of TWA in preterm newborns should probably be considered as an ECG manifestation of heart development rather than of severe heart pathology. Given the small size of subjects involved in the study, this conclusion should be considered preliminary. Further investigations dealing with wider populations of term and preterm infants should be performed in future studies. In adults, TWA associates to heart rate and QT length and represents an index of propensity to arrhythmic events (Burattini, Bini, & Burattini, 2012; Madias, 2007; Nearing & Verrier, 2002; Rosenbaum et al., 1996). Differently, in our nonpathological PTI, TWA does not correlate with HR neither with QT (Table 3), thus suggesting a possible different origin of the electrophysiologic phenomenon. Also, this other preliminary observation needs further studies to be confirmed. Indeed, a low correlation with HR may be due to the small population size and to the low difference of HR values among PTI (low HR standard deviation). Moreover, in this case, TWA is a spontaneous phenomenon, that is, not induced by increased HR reached through pacemaker or exercise (Burattini, Man, et al., 2012; Nearing & Verrier, 2002; Rosenbaum et al., 1996).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24831, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, our study on ten nonpathological PTI provided some insights into the TWA phenomenon in preterm infants and opened an issue on its interpretation that requires further investigations to be solved.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25042, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25063, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "All authors have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately bias the work.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25197, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25218, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Ilaria Marcantoni designed the study, developed the conceptual method, interpreted the results and drafted the manuscript.
