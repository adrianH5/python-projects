Disturbances in autonomic function have been recurrently implicated, manifest as excess sympathetic nerve activity and decreased cardiac vagal tone. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been pursued as a mode of therapy to improve autonomic balance.

The investigators employed the CardioFit\u2122 system (BioControl, Yehud, Israel), which consisted of an implantable neurostimulator device that delivered low-current impulses to the right cervical vagus nerve. A unique feature was that the stimulator was designed to sense heart rate via an electrode in the right ventricle to help regulate VNS and to avoid excess bradycardia while delivering effective stimulation. These observations were further supported by results of the multicenter international CardioFit study. Disappointingly, the Increase Of VAgal TonE in Heart Failure (INOVATE-HF) trial, a large follow-up investigation that enrolled more than 700 patients, was terminated early due to futility in meeting the primary endpoint of reduction in all-cause mortality or first heart failure hospitalization events, notwithstanding substantial improvements in secondary endpoints (NYHA class, quality of life, and 6-minute walk test). Post hoc analysis of the INOVATE-HF study disclosed that sufficient stimulation levels were not attained among all patients and that a criterion response to VNS was observed in only 30% of patients. By comparison, the Autonomic Neural Regulation Therapy to Enhance Myocardial Function in Heart Failure (ANTHEM-HF) interventional clinical trial utilized a stimulation protocol associated with significant improvements in cardiac mechanical function and heart failure symptoms with a desirable safety profile.

VNS has also been reported to inhibit neural release of norepinephrine at cardiac effector junctions, which in turn normalizes autonomic balance as indicated by improvements in heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, attenuates systemic inflammation, improves coronary flow, and is antiapoptotic.

A sizable body of evidence indicates that an increase in HRR is associated with favorable cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, we found evidence of a significant, enduring increase in HRT slope, a parameter that has been linked to enhanced baroreceptor sensitivity and associated with a decrease in cardiac deaths. The increased baroreceptor sensitivity effect appears to reduce the time constant in intrinsic HRR (Fig.\u00a03, lower panel). The physiologic bases whereby VNS enhances HRT slope are incompletely elucidated. However, a plausible mechanism is that VNS stimulates cervical afferent vagal fibers that innervate the aortic arch baroreceptors. This action in turn, through an influence on the central nervous system cardiovascular regulatory sites, results in a classical reciprocal augmentation of vagal efferent activity and decrease in cardiac-bound sympathetic drive. This sequence is akin to that which occurs when sensory fibers in the aortic arch are stimulated by stretch due to an increase in arterial blood pressure. Interestingly, HRT slope and mean banded relaxation parameter changes appear to be independent of changes in heart rate (p\u2009=\u20090.063).

Also, exclusion of patients due to excess ventricular premature beats that precluded analysis of intrinsic HRR or unwillingness to consent to follow-up may have introduced an element of bias in the current results. Thus, there is a need to examine the utility of intrinsic HRR in larger populations of patients in a multinational, randomized, controlled clinical setting to clarify more precisely the role of this parameter in the evaluation and management of HFrEF.
