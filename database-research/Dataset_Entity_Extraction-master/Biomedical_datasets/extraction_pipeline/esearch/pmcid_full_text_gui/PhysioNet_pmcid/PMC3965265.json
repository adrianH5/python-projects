By contrast, the focus of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2012 is to develop methods for patient-specific prediction of in-hospital mortality. The data used for the challenge consisted of 5 general descriptors and 36 time series (measurements of vital signs and laboratory results) from the first 48 hours of the first available ICU stay of 12,000 adult patients from the MIMIC II database. The challenge was organized as two events: event 1 measured performance of a binary classifier, and event 2 measured performance of a risk estimator. The score of event 1 was the lower of sensitivity and positive predictive value. The score for event 2 was a range-normalized Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. A baseline algorithm (using SAPS-1) obtained event 1 and 2 scores of 0.3125 and 68.58 respectively. Most participants submitted entries that outperformed the baseline algorithm. The top final scores for events 1 and 2 were 0.5353 and 17.88 respectively.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1306, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

For example, comparing overall mortality rates between trauma units in a community hospital, a teaching hospital, and a military field hospital is likely to reflect the differences in the patient populations more than any differences in standards of care. The use of acuity scores such as SAPS aims to compensate for population differences in order to compare practice variations objectively. This challenge, however, sought to encourage development of methods for patient-specific prediction of in-hospital mortality, making use of not only the parameters used to compute SAPS scores, but also other observations including time series of vital signs during the 48 hours following ICU admission. Our hypothesis is that this additional information, and particularly observations of dynamic changes in vital signs (as opposed to a single maximum deranged value), may aid in early identification of patients with elevated risk as well as those whose status may be stable or improving.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2658, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.
