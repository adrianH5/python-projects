On the other hand, Physio dataset classifies normal and abnormal heartbeats. Although the difference, the AEN model gave successful and effective results for two different heart sound data sets. The findings were also compared with different classification methods including techniques of AEN, ANNs, SVM, CNN, and DNN. The classification applications with AEN provided the highest accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rates among other classification methods used over the same, most commonly used data sets. That means the obtained results are not as a chance and it is also seen that the number of categories in the output class does not affect the results for the classification by AEN. Thus, it is clear that an AEN model can be used as a practical and efficient method for detecting heart conditions and classifying heart diseases for preliminary diagnosis. Following the evaluation works done for the AEN model, effectiveness of the IoHT system was evaluated by 12 doctors from different hospitals. That evaluation phase included usability-tests as well as the using experiences by doctors in real cases. Additionally, a brief cost analysis for the IoHT system was also provided accordingly. As general, findings from the usability-tests pointed positive thoughts on effectiveness and success of the IoHT system. Except from the feedback for data security aspects, the IoHT system has been tested with some alternative attacks and the system was generally able to reject any data manipulations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 63263, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Thanks to the positive results-findings achieved in this study, the authors have already planned some future works. In this context, additional improvements for building a modular IoHT system (as a more advanced clinical decision support system), which is able to diagnose all kind of diseases and employ additional tasks will be developed in the future. Also, adding alternative diagnostic and treatment methods (with especially deep learning techniques), and performing additional works to test security level are among other future works. It is also remarkable that contributive feedback-comments by the doctors will be considered for further improvements over the IoHT system. Finally, as the COVID-19 issue was threatening the humankind while writing that content, the authors have decided to run additional future works including addition of accessibility features (i.e.\u00a0voice command since the authentication already allows voice analyze), in order to ensure less physical interaction with the system.
