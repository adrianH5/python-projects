The Semantic Bootstrapping Hypothesis postulates that, in order to accomplish this task, children are guided by a neat correspondence between semantic and grammatical categories, since nouns typically refer to objects and verbs to actions. It is this correspondence that guides children\u2019s initial word categorization. Other approaches, on the other hand, suggest that children might make use of distributional cues and word contexts to accomplish the word categorization task. According to such approaches, the Semantic Bootstrapping assumption offers an important limitation, as it might not be true that all the nouns that children hear refer to specific objects or people. In order to explore that, we carried out two studies based on analyses of children\u2019s linguistic input. We analyzed child-directed speech addressed to four children under the age of 2;6, taken from the CHILDES database. The corpora were selected from the Manchester corpus. The corpora from the four selected children contained a total of 10,681 word types and 364,196 word tokens. In our first study, discriminant analyses were performed using semantic cues alone. The results show that many of the nouns found in parents\u2019 speech do not relate to specific objects and that semantic information alone might not be sufficient for successful word categorization. Given that there must be an additional source of information which, alongside with semantics, might assist young learners in word categorization, our second study explores the availability of both distributional and semantic cues in child-directed speech. Our results confirm that this combination might yield better results for word categorization. These results are in line with theories that suggest the need for an integration of multiple cues from different sources in language development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2059, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2072, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of the most significant challenges for children when learning their first language is assigning words to their corresponding syntactic categories. For instance, how do English-learning children know that \u2018table\u2019 is a noun, \u2018eat\u2019 is a verb, and \u2018kiss\u2019 can be both a noun and a verb? Generativist approaches have put forward the so-called Semantic Bootstrapping Hypothesis, which predicts that children use semantic information to map words into their corresponding grammatical category. In particular, children are said to have innately specified information in terms of nouns referring to objects, and verbs referring to actions. The present paper undertakes a critical examination of these assumptions: on the one hand, it tests the reliability of semantic information by examining the amount of nouns in children\u2019s input that refer to specific objects or people; on the other hand, it examines the accuracy with which words could be categorized on the basis of a combination of multiple cues (i.e., both semantic and distributional cues).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3131, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The strength of the semantic bootstrapping approach lies on the idea that mappings between semantics and grammatical classes are universal (e.g., nouns denote objects while verbs denote actions in any language).

Concreteness or imageability might be the underlying predictor of the identifiability of nouns from their observed extralinguistic contexts. Thus, learners\u2019 noun bias might be based on the assumption that object-reference items are the best ones that fit in a word-to-world pairing procedure.

This is also coherent with the results obtained from the input analysis undertaken in the present studies.
