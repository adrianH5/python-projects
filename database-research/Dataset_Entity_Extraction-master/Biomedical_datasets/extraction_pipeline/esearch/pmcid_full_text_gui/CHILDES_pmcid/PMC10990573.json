The present study explores this interaction, how it changes over time and its relationship to syntactic category effects in children acquiring American English. We analyzed 1461 monolingual English-speaking children aged 1;4\u20132;6 from the MB-CDI norming study (Fenson et al.,). Word frequency was estimated from the CHILDES database, and imageability was measured using adult ratings. There was a strong over-additive interaction between frequency and imageability, such that children were more likely to learn a word if it was both highly imageable and very frequent. This interaction was larger in younger children than in older children. There were reliable differences between syntactic categories independent of frequency and imageability, which did not interact with age.

In this simple model, imageability can be interpreted as a proxy for the degree to which the meaning of a word is likely to be accessible in any given situation. What makes more imageable meanings more accessible varies from theory to theory. In theories in which concepts are constructed as a part of word learning, imageability can be thought of as a proxy for the order in which concepts are learned (more concrete ones first, then more abstract ones). In theories in which concepts are largely constructed prior to word learning, imageability can be seen as a proxy for the ease with which the meaning of the word can be inferred from non-linguistic cues to the speaker\u2019s intended meaning, such as eye-gaze, gesture, and the shared physical environment (Gillette et al.,; Snedeker et al.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 7724, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Critically, this shared understanding of word learning\u2014that it depends on encountering interpretable instances of the word in the input\u2014makes two additional predictions. First, early in word learning, there should be a strong over-additive interaction of frequency and imageability such that the child primarily acquires words that are both frequent and imageable. A child might hear a word a million times, but if they cannot represent or identify its meaning, then they cannot map the meaning to the form. For example, the is the most frequent word in English (Davies,), but it is unlikely that a child could determine its meaning until they have learned the meanings of many other English words. Conversely, a word can be conceptually accessible to the child and highly imageable, but if the child never encounters the word, they will not acquire it. For example, the concept of a yurt is concrete and presumably accessible to young children, given the relevant experience. But few English-speaking infants hear the word often enough to learn it. Thus, given the shared assumptions of contemporary word learning theories, early in life children should primarily learn words that are both frequent and imageable. More precisely, the average value of each learning instance should monotonically increase with its accessibility (by proxy, its imageability) resulting in an over-additive interaction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 9128, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, the strength of this interaction should decrease over time. The precise reason for this prediction varies across theories. In theories in which concepts develop in parallel with early words, more abstract concepts should gradually become accessible as the child gets older, allowing abstract but frequent words to be acquired. This would result in a larger frequency effect, a smaller imageability effect and a smaller interaction. On theories where vocabulary acquisition is largely a mapping problem, like syntactic bootstrapping, the imageability bottleneck disappears as children acquire new sources of information to solve the mapping problem (see e.g., Gillette et al.,; Gleitman & Gleitman,; Snedeker & Gleitman,; Snedeker et al.,). When children first begin decoding their language, they must infer a word\u2019s meaning from social cues and extralinguistic context, which strongly favors more imageable words. Older children can use the co-occurrence of a novel word with known words and the syntax of the sentence to make inferences about the message that the speaker is conveying and the likely meaning of the unknown lexical items. This allows a wider range of contexts to be relevant for word learning, resulting in a smaller imageability effect, a persistent frequency effect, and a smaller interaction (since less imageable words can now also benefit from higher frequency).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 10523, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Syntactic Category Effects in Early Word Learning", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 10573, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of the most robust findings in developmental psychology is that composition of children\u2019s vocabulary changes over time (Bornstein et al.,; Caselli et al.,; Fenson et al.,; Gentner et al.,; Kauschke & Hofmeister,; Nice,; Papaeliou & Rescorla,; Schults et al.,; for recent meta-analysis, see Braginsky et al.,).

As their vocabularies grow, an increasing percentage of the words they know are concrete nouns, such as the names of common objects (\u201ccup\u201d) or animals (\u201ckitty\u201d). The proportion of nouns peaks around the time the child produces about 100 words. After this, children begin to learn more predicates, including both verbs and adjectives (Bates et al.,). When the child\u2019s vocabulary reaches about 400 words, there is a systematic increase in the proportion of closed-class items. This category consists of a diverse set of words that mark grammatical functions, which in English includes articles, question words, modals and auxiliary verbs, and prepositions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 11759, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This pattern has been documented most extensively in studies using parent checklists, such as the MacArthur Bates CDI in American English and related instruments in other languages (Bates et al.,; Bornstein et al.,; Braginsky et al.,; Caselli et al.,), and the benchmarks above refer to the number of words that the child produces, as assessed by these instruments. But the pattern is not unique to these checklists. The same broad shifts have been observed in diary studies, direct assessments, and measures of spontaneous production (e.g., Goldin-Meadow et al.,; Greenfield,; Nice,, for reviews see Gentner,). While there is some variability in early vocabulary acquisition across languages and cultures\u2014Italian infants learn more words for family members (Caselli et al.,) and Chinese children acquire more verbs (Tardif et al.,)\u2014the shifts in vocabulary composition are remarkably stable across a wide range of languages and learning contexts (see Braginsky et al.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 12735, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "What is less clear is why there are syntactic category effects. There are two broad possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive. The first is that differences between the categories can be explained by differences in the frequency or imageability of words in that category. Across languages, closed-class words are typically less imageable than predicates, which in turn are less imageable than nouns (see e.g., Gillette et al.,; Hansen,; Ma et al.,). Thus, differences in imageability pattern with differences in acquisition probability in the expected direction. The relationship between frequency and syntactic category is more complex: the individual nouns that children encounter are on average less frequent than the individual verbs, which in turn are far less frequent than the closed-class items (Goodman et al.,; Ma et al.,; Sandhofer et al.,). In short, differences in frequency across these classes pattern in the opposite direction of what would be needed to explain the syntactic category effects. When both frequency and imageability are included in analyses both are reliable predictors, but they do not eliminate the syntactic category effects (see e.g., Hansen,). However, as we noted earlier, there are strong theoretical reasons for expecting that these two variables are not in fact independent but instead have an over-additive interaction.

For example, Markman\u2019s whole-object constraint, which leads children to assume that labels refer to whole objects, rather than to their constituent parts or properties, predicts that children should learn many nouns more readily than verbs (since object kinds are generally nouns). Related constraints like the shape bias, taxonomic constraint, and basic level bias, would facilitate noun learning as well (Golinkoff et al.,; Landau et al.,; Markman,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 15431, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, syntactic category effects could arise from systematic differences in the position of words in utterances that might affect how easy it is to segment and represent word forms. For example, words that frequently occur in isolation are more likely to be learned before 15 months of age than words that rarely occur in isolation (Swingley & Humphrey,). While words of all categories can occur in isolation, many social words are habitually used in this way (e.g., \u201chello\u201d, \u201cthanks\u201d and \u201cno\u201d) and thus we might expect, all other things being equal, that very young children would be more likely to learn social words, than nouns, verbs, or closed-class items. For example, in English, common nouns often occur at the end of an utterance both because in transitive sentences objects occur after verbs and because new and focused information often appears in object position resulting in the use of nouns in this position rather than pronouns. Children generally process and remember utterance final words better than utterance medial words, presumably both because they are often longer and louder (making them easier to recognize) and because they are less likely to be affected by retroactive interference (Fernald et al.,; Peters,; Slobin,; Sundara,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 16701, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Third, syntactic category effects are predicted on theories, like the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis, in which words systematically vary in the nature of the evidence that we use to infer their meaning (Gillette et al.,; Gleitman & Gleitman,; Landau & Gleitman,; Snedeker & Gleitman,). Syntactic bootstrapping is rooted in the observation that words from different syntactic categories tend to have different semantic functions which are reflected in their relationship to both the physical world and to the other words in an utterance. For example, nouns generally refer to specific individuals of the relevant kind. These kinds are defined by properties (e.g., cat-ness, tree-ness) which are independent of the event being described. Consequently, these meanings can often be inferred by mapping the word to the object without knowing anything about the rest of the sentence (Gillette et al.,; Snedeker & Gleitman,; Medina et al.,). Predicates, in contrast, are used to describe relations between event participants, states that may change over time, or properties that are situationally relevant. Inferring the meanings of these predicates, even when they are concrete, often requires identifying the entities under discussion by using the nouns in the sentence and inferring the kind of event being described by using the syntactic structure of the clause (Gillette et al.,; Snedeker & Gleitman,). The syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis argues that these systematic semantic distinctions result in a steady shift in the kinds of words that children are able to acquire as their knowledge of the language grows. While these differences in semantic function may be correlated with differences in imageability, there is no reason to think that ratings of this kind would fully capture these effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 18506, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Prior Findings on the Predictors of Early Lexical Acquisition", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 18568, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As we noted earlier, there is robust evidence that the imageability and frequency of a word predict how early it will be acquired. Imageability is typically measured by asking adults to rate the ease with which they can bring a mental image of the referent to mind (imageability) or the degree to which the word refers to things that can be experienced through the senses (concreteness, Paivio et al.,). These two kinds of ratings are very highly correlated (see Methods) and appear to tap into the same underlying psychological construct (e.g., Scott et al.,). For this reason, we will refer to the construct as imageability, and use the word concreteness only when describing individual studies using this specific variable. Imageability is a highly robust predictor of early word learning, producing strong effects regardless of whether other variables such as frequency or syntactic category are present in the model (Hao et al.,; Ma et al.,; McDonough et al.,; Smol\u00edk,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 19545, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The effect of frequency is a little more complicated, but it emerges reliably so long as two conditions are met. First, because frequency is negatively correlated with imageability and systematically different across syntactic categories (Hansen,; Hao et al.,; McDonough et al.,), the simple correlation between frequency and age of acquisition (or probability of acquisition) is often weak or even absent (see e.g., Goodman et al.,). When imageability or syntactic category are included in the analysis, or when the analysis is restricted to a single syntactic category, then frequency effects are consistently present and typically quite large (Braginsky et al.,; Goodman et al.,; Swingley & Humphrey,). Second, word frequency distributions are highly skewed such that most words are low frequency, while a few are highly frequent. Psycholinguistic research has consistently found that the cognitive and linguistic effects of frequency are best captured on a log scale (Baayen,).

Developmental theories, however, do not assume that image generation itself is the mechanism driving the correlation between imageability and word learning. Instead, it is treated as a proxy for one (or both) of two things. First, imageability can be viewed as an indirect measure of the degree to which a concept is accessible to a young infant. For example, infants might acquire the concepts encoded in highly imageable words prior to word learning, making these words easier to learn. In contrast, less imageable words might have meanings that the child can only conceptualize at a later stage of development making these words impossible to learn at earlier ages. Second, imageability could be a proxy for the informativity of each learning instance.

This interaction should get smaller over time as more concepts become cognitively accessible, leading to an increase in the main effect of frequency. If imageability is a proxy for the average informativity of each instance, then an interaction is predicted because the incremental effect of each instance the infant encounters is greater for the more imageable words.

First, the difference in findings could, logically, be attributable to differences in how children acquire English, as opposed to Czech and Norwegian. Perhaps there are differences in the syntax of these languages, the properties of words, or in the kinds of input children receive in these communities that lead to a difference in acquisition outcomes. While this is a logical possibility, we think it is unlikely. We know of no property that Czech and Norwegian have in common that sets them apart from English. By the most obvious metrics, Norwegian and English are more similar to each other than either is to Czech (e.g., both are Germanic languages with relatively strict word order in which case is often unmarked). Furthermore, the main effects of frequency and imageability seem to be very similar across a wide range of languages (see Braginsky et al.,). Nothing in the Hansen or Smol\u00edk data suggests that these factors behave differently in Czech or Norwegian, so it would be surprising if their interaction was different. Finally, as we noted earlier, the interaction of frequency and imageability is a straightforward prediction of our shared model of word learning. If each instance of an imageable word is less informative, we should expect an over additive interaction in early word learning across linguistic environments. Therefore, we believe that linguistic differences cannot explain these conflicting results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 57965, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The second possibility is that the differences in the findings reflect differences in the words that were included in the analysis. In our study, we included nearly all words from the toddler CDI: social words (including animal sounds and interjections), nouns, predicates, and closed-class items. Both Hansen and Smol\u00edk included focused solely on nouns and predicates. Closed-class items are characterized by very high frequency and very low imageability (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Thus, they provide the data that is most challenging for a simple additive model: any model that includes a positive effect of frequency and no interaction term is likely to predict precocious acquisition of these terms. Social words, in contrast, vary considerably in their interaction term and in their mean age of acquisition. Excluding both classes of words could reduce the magnitude of the interaction effect.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 58866, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, the absence of an interaction term could reflect Hansen\u2019s and Smol\u00edk\u2019s decisions to use a constructed variable (median age of acquisition) and a linear analysis. The presence or absence of an interaction depends on the scale used to measure the dependent variable (as well as the scaling of the predictor variables). Our dependent variable was closely linked to the underlying structure of the data set (children are either reported to know a word or not) and the psychological process that we believe it represents (does the child have a stable mapping for the word that allows them to produce it). In contrast, the median age of acquisition provides a concise summary of the data, but it has no clear interpretation at a cognitive or behavioral level. Critically, these two dependent variables cannot be directly mapped to one another: a word could have a median age of acquisition of 24 months and be known by 40% of 18-month-olds, or it could be known by no 18-month-olds at all. Future work could explore these three possibilities by comparing logistic analyses with age of acquisition analyses within each language along with the effects of including or excluding social words and closed-class items from the analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 60105, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Examining Syntax and Its Relation to Word Learning", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 60156, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our findings shed further light on the consistent finding that children learn words from some categories before others. Specifically, our models demonstrate that these differences cannot be fully accounted for by the differences in imageability and frequency between the words in these categories or, critically, by differences in the interaction between imageability and frequency. Our findings on this point diverge from two other studies. Hansen found that syntactic categories did not improve prediction of median age of acquisition beyond imageability for Norwegian nouns and verbs. McDonough and colleagues\u2019 (2009) found that the effect of syntactic category in English flipped direction when imageability was included in a model predicting median age of acquisition. This raises the question of why words in some categories are acquired before others. There are three broad classes of hypotheses that might account for this pattern.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 61098, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "First, the differences could reflect language specific learning biases that privilege some syntactic categories over others. For example, many of the word learning biases put forward by Markman and others\u2013such as the whole-object bias, the taxonomic constraint, and the shape bias\u2013would privilege hypotheses that would facilitate learning nouns for basic-level object and animal categories (Landau et al.,; Markman,; Smith et al.,). For example, a child who initially assumes that a novel word picks out a taxonomic category of objects with a consistent shape, should close in on the right hypothesis when hearing \u201cball\u201d but not when hearing \u201ccatch!\u201d. To the extent that these biases are the product of early word learning (Smith et al.,), their effects should overlap with other factors (like imageability and frequency) that allow those first words to be acquired. Once the bias has been acquired, however, it could have effects on vocabulary composition that go beyond these variables (e.g., benefitting a noun more than a verb that is matched for frequency and imageability). This explanation seems most plausible as an explanation for why nouns are acquired before verbs and closed-class items.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 62310, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, the category differences could reflect differences in the perceptual salience or position of words which make it easier for learners to segment them from the speech stream and learn their forms. Many social words are performatives that are likely to appear in isolation, a factor that is known to increase the probability of early acquisition (Swingley & Humphrey,). Closed-class words tend to be short with reduced vowels. Closed-class words are also often in the same prosodic phrase as an adjacent content word, potentially making them more difficult to segment and perceive. In English, lexical nouns frequently appear at the end of the utterance (in object position) where they are longer and followed by a pause. Previous studies have found that length, position and use isolation are predictors of early learning (Braginsky et al.,; Swingley & Humphrey,). Nevertheless, in models where perceptual factors and syntactic category are both included as predictors, the difference between nouns and verbs persists (Swingley & Humphrey,). This suggests that syntactic category differences are not solely due to position. Additional evidence comes from studies of vocabulary acquisition in languages with verb final word order\u2013like Korean and Japanese. Children learning such languages also acquire nouns, on average, earlier than verbs, suggesting that the difference between these two classes is not solely attributable to order (Bornstein et al.,; Frank et al.,; Kim et al.,; Ogura et al.,). Future studies should explore whether the effects of syntactic category, independent of position, persist when the interaction between imageability and frequency are included in the model: both in English and in languages with more verb-friendly syntax.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 64069, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, the effects of syntactic category on learnability could be linked to semantic differences between these classes which are not fully captured by measures like imageability. One candidate is the semantic function of different words. Most nouns in child-directed speech refer to entities (e.g., objects or animals) that are stable over time and space. Verbs, in contrast, refer to events which are short lived. The meaning of a noun is largely independent of the other words in the sentence (e.g., a piano is a piano regardless of whether it is played or sat on), while the meaning of a verb often depends on the arguments it takes (e.g., playing a piano vs playing a game). Most nouns in children\u2019s early vocabulary group individuals into categories (i.e., kinds) on the basis of stable properties (e.g., cats generally continue to be cats and cups continue being cups) while verbs might apply to an individual one moment but not the next (e.g., in a good conversation the listeners and the talkers are constantly changing). For these reasons, it is difficult for even knowledgeable adults to infer the verb that is being used in a sentence from visual context alone (Gillette et al.,; Snedeker & Gleitman,). In contrast, many of the nouns in child-directed speech can be easily identified just from the visual context (Gillette et al.,; Medina et al.,). Verbs become far easier to identify, when adults are given information about either the syntax of the sentence, or about the nouns that occur with the verb (Gillette et al.,; Snedeker & Gleitman,). This suggests that knowing some nouns may be a prerequisite to learning many verbs. Difference in meaning, reference and semantic complexity could also play a role in precocious acquisition of social words and the delayed acquisition of closed-class items. Many social words are performatives (choo choo, bye). These words do not necessarily have a referent (or a syntactic category). They are steps in a ritual, to be uttered at the right time and in the correct context. Thus, a child can learn them without identifying the adult conceptualization of the event, breaking it into pieces and mapping the word to the correct conceptual chunk. Instead, the child just has to identify the contexts in which the ritual happens and when they should perform their part. Closed-class items, in contrast, are often modeled as high-level functions that take nouns, verbs or even whole clauses as their arguments. While these semantic dimensions are clearly correlated with imageability, this correlation is unlikely to be perfect (\u201chi\u201d is abstract but not semantically complex). Future work could explore the role of factors that capture these core conceptual distinctions and their relation to imageability, syntactic category and the acquisition trajectory.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 66886, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 66898, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, we only explored vocabulary development between the age of 16 and 30 months. While our theories of word learning predict that this interaction should be present in even younger children, we chose not to include the norming data for the infant CDI (ages 8\u201316 months) which assesses both comprehension and production. This decision reflected three considerations. First, many children are reported to produce few or no words at these ages, limiting the power of a model focused solely on production in this age group. Second, while there is evidence validating the CDI comprehension measure as an aggregate variable, there are also reasons to believe that it is a less accurate measure at the level of individual words. When parents are asked what words their child says, they may search their memories for what they have heard. When they are asked what words their child understands, they must make more complex inferences based on children\u2019s responses to whole utterances in rich contexts. In the absence of clear data, a parent may rely on their implicit theory of development (or their child) rather than concrete experiences. Finally, and most critically, the infant CDI may not include the range of words needed to observe this interaction. The infant form contains a subset of the words from the toddler CDI. Many of the words that are absent from the infant CDI are words that are extremely high in frequency, extremely low in imageability, and rare in early speech (e.g., the, a, she, he, think). Others are words that are low frequency but imageable (pumpkin and popsicle). We suspect that this reflects that procedure by which the instruments were constructed: words were initially selected based on their appearance in records of children\u2019s early vocabularies and were retained as the instrument was refined based on their ability to capture individual and developmental change. As a result, words that were rarely uttered by children under 16 months were eliminated from the infant form. Our findings, based on the youngest kids tested with the toddler form, suggest that at even earlier ages, children are primarily producing words that are both imageable and frequent. But this pattern would be difficult to detect in an instrument in which few of the other words remain. Nevertheless, our current theories of word learning clearly predict that this interaction should be present in the youngest word learners and in comprehension as well as production, provided that we have valid measures that include a wide-enough range of the words. The concerns raised above suggest that future studies should also consider analyzing children\u2019s vocabularies relative to all words that they have been exposed to, rather than relative to a set of words that other children acquired fairly early in life. Doing so would require different methods of data collection.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 69823, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A further limitation of our study is that it focuses solely on English. Braginsky and colleagues\u2019 analyses of CDI data from 10 languages strongly suggests that predictors of acquisition are broadly similar across languages. There are two reasons, however, to question whether the patterns that we observed here would appear in other languages. First, as we noted earlier, the absence of a frequency-by-imageability interaction in Hansen (Norwegian) and in Smol\u00edk (Czech) raises the possibility that this effect varies across languages or learning environments. Second, there is a large literature exploring the degree to which there are cross-linguistic differences in syntactic category acquisition. For example, the early bias for nouns does not seem as pronounced in Mandarin Chinese as in other languages (Braginsky et al.,; Hao et al.,). This phenomenon has been tied to different properties of the language. For example, predicates seem to receive higher imageability ratings on average in Mandarin than in English, perhaps making these words more easily learned at an earlier age (Ma et al.,). In addition, caregivers speaking these languages seem to produce more predicates in child-directed speech, making them more accessible earlier on (Tardif et al.,). Mandarin also permits subject and object omission, meaning that predicates are more likely to be encountered alone (Lee & Naigles,). An analysis exploring syntactic category effects in relation to imageability, frequency, and their interaction, could help address the question of whether there are differences in the word learning strategies of the Mandarin and English learners, or just differences in the outcomes due to differences in the inputs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 71541, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, our analyses did not incorporate many of the variables that have been explored in previous papers. As a result, we cannot assess the degree to which the interaction that we observed can account for these effects or whether controlling for these variables would eliminate the syntactic category effects. The value of such analyses depends on the following: the degree to which we believe that the variable in question is available to young children, whether we have a model of how it might influence acquisition (allowing us to scale the variable appropriately and focus on the most relevant interactions), and our understanding of how the effect of that variable might change over development. From this perspective the variables that seem most critical for future models are phonemic length and complexity and measures of perceptual salience such as frequency in isolation and frequency in utterance final position. Complexity might be construed as a filter on production, affecting that probability that the child who has successfully mapped a word (perhaps on the basis of its frequency and imageability) is able to produce a close enough approximation to be credited with using it. This could result in a three-way interaction. Curiously, neither Braginsky et al. nor Swingley and Humphrey found that measures of complexity (length and phonotactic probability, respectively) were reliable predictors of English language production. However, Braginsky found length to be a robust predictor of production across languages. This could potentially reflect differences in cultural practices around the interpretation of child utterances. Measures of perceptual salience, in contrast, have been consistently associated with higher probability of early acquisition (Braginsky et al.,; Swingley & Humphrey,). These are most readily construed as modulators of frequency or alternative measures of frequency: variables that affect whether a given instance of a word is perceived at all at a given age.
