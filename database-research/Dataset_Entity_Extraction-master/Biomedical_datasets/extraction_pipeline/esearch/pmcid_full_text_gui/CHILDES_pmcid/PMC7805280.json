Our analysis of the MLU in CDS, family-, and experimenter-directed ADS found significant differences between CDS and ADS_Fam, and between ADS_Fam and ADS_Exp, but not between CDS and ADS_Exp. Our finding suggests that researchers should pay more attention to controlling the level of formality in CDS and ADS when comparing the two registers for their speech characteristics.

The importance of ecologically valid spontaneous speech data has particularly been viewed critical in the area of child language acquisition where research questions often involve biological predisposition to language development. Earlier studies of child language, especially those focusing on phonological aspects of language development, used to base their investigation on a handful amount of data collected in a lab setting (e.g.,). However, data collection with young children poses various challenges since it is hard to maintain their focus on the task and usually not feasible to elicit target words or constructions of interest from young participants in a lab setting. With the development of technology, increasingly more researchers are creating a corpus of spontaneous speech in a natural setting. Yet, transcribing vocalizations or speech produced by young children and even the adult when interacting with their children is quite challenging compared to the conventional lab speech or adult-to-adult conversation. As such, despite the importance of spontaneous data in the research of child language acquisition, it takes considerably more time and efforts to create a corpus involving young children and their caregivers compared to constructing a corpus of speech between adults. In this regard, making such data accessible via a repository such as the CHILDES database is important for the research community directly or indirectly working on issues related to language acquisition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2682, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With the advancement of densely connected internet and affordable disk space on the one hand, and the movement toward the practice of open science in which researchers share their data and scripts with the community on the other, the amount of child language corpus downloadable for free on the internet has been on a rapid rise. Despite the many number of corpora available in the CHILDES database, however, there are very few corpora of Korean mothers interacting with their children publicly available yet. Further, there is very little information on the construction of mother-child interaction corpora, in particular a detailed description of the transcription criteria, despite the many decisions that have to be made against challenges posed by the nature of spontaneous speech. The Ko corpus of Korean mother\u2013child interaction was created to help fill in this gap, and this paper provides detailed information on how this corpus was created and the transcription criteria along with the rationale for making judgments for a number of issues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3735, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present corpus is differentiated from the existing body of open-access child language data in several regards. First, the data collection was designed to include the adult-directed speech (ADS) as well as the child-directed speech (CDS) from the same speakers. Though there are other corpora which include occasional adult-to-adult conversations, our corpus was designed to include the ADS at the outset so that research comparing the registers of CDS and ADS can find the data more systematically. Further, there are two different formalities of ADS provided, i.e., the family-directed ADS (ADS_Fam) collected while the mother talks with her family member or a close friend over the phone, and the more formal experimenter-directed ADS (ADS_Exp) capturing the interaction of the mother with the experimenter. Most previous studies involving ADS elicited ADS_Exp simply by having the mother engage in a conversation with the experimenter (e.g.,). In the literature of sociolinguistics, however, it is well-known that the level of formality in the relation between interlocutors results in differences in speaking styles (e.g.,). In this regard, it would be ideal to balance the formality between the CDS and ADS when comparing differences in the speech as a function of speech register which varies according to the developmental needs of the language learning listener. Since CDS is a speech register that is likely to be on the lowest end of the formality continuum, we sought to elicit a comparable formality of ADS by having the mother talk with one of her family members or close friends.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5333, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, we provide manually segmented crisp utterance boundaries so that research looking into temporal aspects of mother\u2013child interaction can be conducted with more accuracy. The first step necessary for the preparation of the audio transcription is cutting up the long stream of recoding into a manageable sized sequences. The criterion we adopted in the creation of our transcription is to cut the utterances without including the pauses before or after the actual speech articulation. It seems that most of the corpora previously released for open access do not have a specific guideline as to where to draw the utterance boundaries. Thus, a piece of speech stream segmented as a single utterance would include a varying duration of silence either preceding or following the actual articulation of an utterance. For this reason, an utterance segment that might appear to be a 10 second-long utterance according to the time stamps may actually contain a speech articulation that lasts only for 2 seconds. Such a segmentation practice might not be relevant for many researchers but can cause a problem when the research question is related to temporal aspects of speech such as speaking rate (e.g.,) or response time in turn taking (e.g.,). The transcription of our corpus includes an explicit interval for non-speech, usually the silence interval, included with time stamps as one of the main tiers (\u2217PAU) in addition to the usual speaker tiers such as the mother (\u2217MOT) and the child speech (\u2217CHI) tiers. With the adoption of an explicit segmentation scheme, research dealing with temporal aspects of mother\u2013child interaction would benefit in drawing a more informative conclusion and approximating the actual numbers. For example, analyzed the Providence corpus in the CHILDES and found that mothers\u2019 speaking rate accelerates in the multi-word stage of the children. Her calculation of the speaking rate was based on the time stamps in the transcript thus margins before and after the utterances were also included in the duration of the utterances. Calculations based on such non-crisp boundaries should still yield a valid result when it comes to capturing the developmental tendency because the noise in the data was randomly distributed across all transcription. It was, however, hard to interpret the actual speaking rate yielded by this calculation due to the inclusion of silences in segmentating the utterances.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7772, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The current corpus serves as the only cross-sectional open-access multimodal corpus of mother-child spontaneous interaction in the Korean language as of this writing.

In particular, there is a greater increase in MLU as children progress from Early-Lexical to Advanced-Lexical stage.

Thus, the increase in MLU in our data might reflect a different degree of advancement in syntax than in a morpheme-based, or even word-based MLU of a non-agglutinative language such as English.

Our analysis of the MLU in CDS, family-directed ADS, and experimenter-directed ADS found significant differences between CDS and ADS_Fam, and ADS_Fam and ADS_Exp, but not between CDS and ADS_Exp. Our finding suggests that researchers should pay more attention to controlling the level of formality in CDS and ADS when comparing the two registers for their speech characteristics.
