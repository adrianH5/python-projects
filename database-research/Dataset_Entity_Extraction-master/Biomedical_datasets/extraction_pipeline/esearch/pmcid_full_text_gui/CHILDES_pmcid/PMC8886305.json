A significant body of experimental research shows that infants use multiple cues to do so; however, little research has comprehensively examined the distribution of such cues in naturalistic speech. We conducted a comprehensive corpus analysis of German child-directed speech (CDS) using data from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database, investigating the availability of word stress, transitional probabilities (TPs), and lexical and sublexical frequencies as potential cues for word segmentation. Seven hours of data (~15,000 words) were coded, representing around an average day of speech to infants. The analysis revealed that for 97% of words, primary stress was carried by the initial syllable, implicating stress as a reliable cue to word onset in German CDS. Word identity was also marked by TPs between syllables, which were higher within than between words, and higher for backwards than forwards transitions. Words followed a Zipfian-like frequency distribution, and over two-thirds of words (78%) were monosyllabic. Of the 50 most frequent words, 82% were function words, which accounted for 47% of word tokens in the entire corpus. Finally, 15% of all utterances comprised single words. These results give rich novel insights into the availability of segmentation cues in German CDS, and support the possibility that infants draw on multiple converging cues to segment their input.

Importantly, each language differs in the availability and likely combination of cues for segmentation, meaning each solution will necessarily be language-specific (see).

To do this, we extracted pairs of syllables from either within or between words within utterances only (i.e., not crossing utterance boundaries, which are typically indicated by a pause or a switch in speakers), and calculated forwards and backwards TPs for both contexts. Forwards TPs were calculated following Equation (1a), and backwards TPs following Equation (1b). That is, the forwards TPs within the word \u201cbaby,\u201d for instance, were calculated by dividing the number of times the two syllables \u201cba\u201d and \u201cby\u201d co-occurred by the total number of times the syllable \u201cba\u201d occurred:", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20044, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Figure 1 shows that both backwards and forwards TPs are higher within than between words.

A recent computational model of word learning suggests that cue variability may indeed serve to help, rather than hinder, learning\u2014guiding the creation of a robust, canalized language system that is resistant to noise in the input. This possible utility of noise in learning is underpinned by the principle that variation in the availability and reliability of distributional cues may encourage learners to seek guidance from multiple possible information sources, reducing the importance of a particular individual cue, and increasing the resilience of the language system to noise.

The amount of monosyllabic words reported here was considerably higher than that described in previous reports on German (78% here, versus 50% in \u2014which Zipf\u2019s calculations were based upon). This discrepancy may be traced back to the contrast between spoken and written language, with spoken language shortening words by the use of contractions; or the difference may be due to the contrast between child-directed and adult-directed speech, with CDS potentially being defined not only by the use of a higher pitch and shorter utterances (e.g.,), but also by the use of shorter words in general (; but see). This resulted in a much larger proportion of monosyllabic words here than in frequency dictionary (though a comparison of our data with data for more recent adult-directed speech, collected in a similar manner, would be necessary to draw more firm conclusions). In any case, data from our corpus indicate that caregivers may optimize word length (via simplification) for efficient communication to a greater extent in child\u2014compared to adult\u2014directed speech (see), with even more monosyllabic words than would be predicted by Zipf\u2019s law. This in turn offers an interesting new perspective on the finding that a variety of word lengths adds difficulty to segmentation.
