Although all normal children succeed in learning their native tongue, neither psychology nor linguistics has yet succeeded in accounting for the many complexities of language learning. Within this general area, there has been particular attention to the acquisition of grammar, as it is expressed through morphosyntax, stimulated in large measure by Chomsky\u2019s theory of Universal Grammar and its attendant claims regarding innate principles and parameters. Beyond its theoretical importance, the measurement of morphosyntactic competence is crucial to applied work in fields such as developmental language disorders, schooling and literacy, and second language acquisition. To test and validate theoretical predictions quantitatively, researchers have increasingly come to rely on large corpora of transcript data of verbal interactions between children and parents to examine the development of morphosyntax. A standard source of data in this area is the CHILDES database (; http://childes.psy.cmu.edu), which provides 300 megabytes of transcript data for over twenty-five human languages, as well as a large amount of digitized audio and video linked to the transcripts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2341, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are now numerous studies that have used the CHILDES database to investigate the development of morphosyntax. However, these studies have typically been limited to using the database in its raw lexical form, without tags for part-of-speech, syntactic parses or predicate\u2013argument information. Lacking this information, researchers have devoted long hours of manual analysis to locating and coding the sentences relevant to their hypotheses. Because these isolated manual annotation efforts of small segments of the database were not based on shared community standards, the resulting analyses are often discrepant and non-replicable, and much of the resulting corpus-based research on syntactic development has been only weakly cumulative. If syntactic parses were available, these analyses could be largely automated, allowing investigators to conduct a wider variety of tests in a more reliable fashion. Automatic syntactic analysis systems would also be of great value in clinical settings, allowing clinicians and clinical researchers to construct profiles of language delays by comparing small speech samples collected in structured interviews with a larger database of normed data. To this end, the raw information in the CHILDES corpora has been gradually enriched by a layer of morphological information. In particular, the English section of the database is augmented with categorical and morphological information at the lexical level in the form of part-of-speech (POS) and morphological tags for each word.

Although proposed an annotation scheme for syntactic information in CHILDES, until recently no significant amount of annotated data had been made publicly available. To correct this situation, we have developed a method for automatic annotation of the entire English CHILDES corpus (Eng-USA, Eng-UK, Clinical and Narrative), including utterances spoken by children and by adults. The first steps in this process involved manually annotating several thousands of words and continually revising and extending the annotation scheme during this process to account for the wide variety of structures found in real corpora. Next, we trained a state-of-the-art data-driven syntactic parser on our manually annotated corpus. We then further annotated a corpus of over 18,800 utterances (approximately 65,000 words), which we cross-checked manually to develop a gold standard. Of these 18,800 utterances, approximately 8,600 were spoken by children. We then retrained our statistical parser using this gold-standard corpus. In the final step, we used the parser to automatically annotate both the child and adult utterances in the entire English section of CHILDES.

Second, these annotations now provide appropriate targets for the evaluation of competing models of syntactic development. To this end, we represent syntactic information using a scheme that focuses on specific grammatical relations, attempting to abstract away from theory-specific assumptions that may be adopted in different models of syntactic development. Third, the syntactic parser that produces these grammatical relation annotations, along with existing tools for POS annotation, can be used to automate syntactic profiling through instruments such as Developmental Sentence Scoring or the Index of Productive Syntax.

In addition to the head and dependent words, a GR also includes a label (or GR type) that indicates what kind of syntactic relationship holds between the two words. Figure 1 shows how the sentence We eat the cheese sandwich is annotated in our scheme. In this example, each arrow corresponds to a grammatical relation, where the head word points to the dependent word.

Grammatical relations are both intuitive to understand and straightforward to represent, which make them easier to annotate manually than representations that rely more heavily on embedded structures, such as phrase structure or constituent trees. Focusing on word-to-word relationships also makes the annotations easy to use, since each type of relation is meaningful both within a sentence and in isolation. For example, finding instances of pronouns used as subjects or direct objects is a simple matter of searching for SUBJ or OBJ annotations with the pronoun part-of-speech tag. In a representation based on constituents, however, a more complex search for a tree fragment involving noun phrases (NPs) and verb phrases (VPs) would be necessary. At the same time, representing GRs using labeled dependency trees allows for representation of much of the same hierarchical syntactic structure present in constituent structures, although some information about constituent boundaries is not represented. In addition, dependency structures are well-suited for high-accuracy parsing using data-driven natural language processing approaches. This makes large-scale automatic annotation possible, starting only with a limited amount of manually annotated data. Finally, representation of syntax through dependency-based GRs allows us to focus on specific syntactic phenomena without many of the theory-specific assumptions necessary for syntactic representation with more complex formalisms.

This is reflected in the annotation scheme: the Seth corpus, following the annotation of, is abundant with filler syllables (approximately 11% of all tokens). Because the parser was trained with material that did not contain any instances of filler syllables, it has no hope of analyzing those correctly. Because parser actions are determined according to context within the utterance, the presence of filler syllables often results in a cascade of errors. This problem is exacerbated in a left-to-right parsing approach by the fact that filler syllables usually occur near the beginning of an utterance (so the parser is guaranteed to make an early error, creating an unknown syntactic context for subsequent actions). On utterances in the Seth corpus that did not contain filler syllables, the accuracy of the parser was only slightly below its accuracy on Eve utterances.
