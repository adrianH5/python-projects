In our investigation, 85 liver metastasis tissues and 229 CRC tissues from three GSE datasets of the GEO database were included. A total of 92 DEGs, including 22 down-regulated genes and 70 up-regulated genes, were discovered. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis using the online DAVID software showed that the metastatic process was a complex system with several function changes. The up-regulated DEGs were found to be particularly enriched in cellular protein metabolic process, posttranslational protein modification, platelet degranulation, negative regulation of endopeptidase activity, blood coagulation, acute-phase response, receptor-mediated endocytosis, innate immune response, retinoid metabolic process, neutrophil degranulation, and 114 other BPs. The up-regulated DEGs were also accumulated in 27 CCs, including the extracellular region, extracellular exosome, extracellular space, blood microparticle, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, cell surface, platelet alpha granule lumen, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, chylomicron, very-low-density lipoprotein particle, etc. Additionally, the up-regulated DEGs were also found to be significantly enriched in 39 MF areas, including protein binding, identical protein binding, receptor binding, serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, heparin binding, endopeptidase inhibitor activity, phospholipid binding, heme binding, lipid binding, serine-type endopeptidase activity, etc. KEGG pathway analysis showed that up-regulated DEGs were found in 14 aspects such as complement and coagulation cascades, metabolic pathways, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, cholesterol metabolism, COVID-19, retinol metabolism, etc. Given the small amount of enrichment of down-regulated DEGs, the particular results were clarified in Figure S1 and Table S2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 28881, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Numerous interactions among the up-regulated DEGs were discovered by constructing PPI networks, and MCODE was then used to investigate hub genes such as ALDH8A1, SLC2A2, HGD, AGXT, F9, SERPINA10, and C8A (Figure 3C,3D). Our further investigation of the relationship between hub gene expression and the prognosis of COAD patients by UALCAN analysis yielded regrettable results. So, we shifted our minds to focus the results on GO, KEGG, and PPI; we found that complement and coagulation cascades were significantly enriched in the up-regulated DEGs, and C5 and C8A seemed to exert a key function in the PPI network construction (Figure 2D and Figure 3).

The complement system has been shown to play a complex role in various cancer types at different stages. On the one hand, the complement system plays a role in the direct killing effects on tumors via activation of the immune system; on the other hand, it promotes tumor progression, metastasis, immune escape, and immunosuppression, etc. through long-term low or high expression of complement-related factors in the tumor microenvironment system to maintain chronic local inflammation. The complement system can be activated through classical, lectin, or alternative pathways to further stimulate antigen-presenting cells (APC) to recognize tumor cells. Meanwhile, the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) by the complement system (namely complement-dependent cytotoxicity) can lead to tumor cell lysis.

Another study reported that the C3AR and C5AR1-mediated signaling pathways promoted the transformation of the tumor microenvironment to tumor progression by activating the polarizing natural immune cells, inhibiting effector T cells, and releasing pro-tumor factors. C5AR1 has even been shown to inhibit T helper 1 (Th1) production and convert tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into M2 phenotype. Daugan et al. reported that increased expression of the C4-activating enzyme, C1s, by tumor cells is linked to a poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), and the primary mechanisms are a high infiltration of macrophages and T cells, complement cascade reaction, and the non-canonical method.
