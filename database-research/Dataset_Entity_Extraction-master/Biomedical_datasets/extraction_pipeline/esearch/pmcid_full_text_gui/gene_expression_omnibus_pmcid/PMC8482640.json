It often occurs in people aged 50\u201360\u2009years. The clinical manifestations, complications, high degree of malignancy, and poor prognosis of UVM seriously threaten the visual function and life of patients. At present, the main treatment methods for UVM are enucleation, photocoagulation, local tumor resection, and external scleral application radiotherapy. Although these treatments have achieved a certain degree of success, there are still some problems. The most common sites of metastasis are the liver, lung, and bone. Furthermore, the mortality rate of UVM is as high as 50%. Currently, the etiology and molecular mechanisms of UVM are still unclear. The abnormal expression of multiple genes may be involved.

MMPs can degrade various protein components in the extracellular matrix. Meanwhile, they can also destroy the histological barrier of tumor cell and affect tumor migration, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Therefore, MMPs are considered as the main proteolytic enzymes in this process and the relation between MMPs and extracellular matrix components is interactive. According to their substrates, MMPs can be divided into six categories: (1) collagenases, including MMP1 (collagenase-1), MMP8 (collagenase-2), MMP13 (collagenase-3) with the main function of degrading collagen I, II, and III; (2) gelatinases, including MMP2 (gelatinase A) and MMP9 (gelatinase B), with the function of degrading collagen I and IV; (3) stromelysins, including MMP3 (stromelysin-1) and MMP11 (stromelysin-3); (4) MMP7. Its substrates are elastin, fibronectin, and laminin. They are necessary for the epithelization of mucosal wounds; (5) MMP12, the substrates of MMP12 are mainly type IV collagen, gelatin, fibronectin, and laminin; (6) Membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), including MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17, MMP24, and MMP25. The substrates of MMP14 are type I, II, and III collagen. They can promote keratinocyte growth, airway re-epithelization, and cell migration. However, the role of the other MT-MMPs remains unclear.

Moreover, the expression of MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP16 was positively correlated with OS and DFS. We also found that most MMPs correlated with the infiltration of immune cells.
