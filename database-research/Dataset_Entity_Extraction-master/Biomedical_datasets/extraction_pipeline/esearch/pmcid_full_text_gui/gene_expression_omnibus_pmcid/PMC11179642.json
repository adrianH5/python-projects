The pathology of OA is associated with cartilage ageing or overuse leading to the loss of chondrocyte homeostasis and death, resulting in friction between bones. The pathogenesis of OA is related to complex factors, including genetic susceptibility, ageing, inflammation, obesity and uneven joint arrangement. The relationship between OA and inflammation has become a major focus of research in recent years, and several studies have implicated inflammation in OA pathogenesis. In addition, anti-inflammatory strategies have become the primary means of treating OA. Disulfidptosis is a novel type of PCD. Disulfide stress occurs in glucose-deficient cells with high expression of SLC7A11, inducing abnormal disulfide cross-linking between actin cytoskeletal proteins and cytoskeletal contraction, eventually leading to actin network collapse and PCD. Patients with OA have lower levels of cytoskeletal proteins in their cartilage compared to healthy individuals., indicating that the deterioration of OA is related to the destruction of actin. However, during disulfidptosis, the ingestion of abundant cystine may induce an increase in the concentration of intracellular glutathione and NADPH, which can lead to a decrease in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, the decreased levels of ROS play a crucial role in anti-inflammatory pathways, which can decrease the severity of OA and inhibits its progression. Maintaining pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the internal environment of patients is particularly crucial for promoting early relief and inhibiting the progression of OA.

Therefore, effective predictive strategies for distinguishing various inflammatory stages and for early diagnosis of OA should be developed. In this study, two disulfidptosis-related subtypes of OA were identified via consensus clustering. The disulfidptosis score was higher in the C1 subtype than in the C2 subtype, indicating that patients with the C1 subtype had more severe disulfidptosis with higher expression of the three regulators. Furthermore, there was a significant difference for the infiltration of the immune cells in the synovial tissue between these two disulfidptosis-related subtypes. Specifically, the infiltration score of Type 17 T helper cells were higher in C2, which emphasized that the inflammation response were more severe in the synovial tissue of OA patients with lower disulfidptosis score since the Type 17 T helper cells are regarded as the immune cell cluster playing a crucial role in inducing the inflammation response via releasing several cytokines like IL17, IL23, and so on. While other anti-inflammatory immune cells, including activated CD8 T cell, effector memory CD4 T cell, memory B cell, and monocyte, exhibited a higher infiltration in C1.

Although two validation datasets were used, the sample size was relatively limited. Moreover, owing to ethical limitations, we could not obtain completely healthy human synovial tissue samples. More comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments should be conducted to validate the findings of this study.

Moreover, the disulfidptosis score plays a crucial role in predicting the inflammatory responses and immune infiltration of OA, using which may predict the disease severity of OA and provide the personalized therapeutic strategies for OA patients. In addition, the disulfidptosis-mediated diagnostic model exhibited potential predictive efficiency. Furthermore, the transcriptomic level and single-cell level were merged to emphasize the crucial role of disulfidptosis, which was also validated in our in-house cohort. Altogether, disulfidptosis may be a new potential target for the diagnosis, stratification, targeted prevention and personalized treatment of OA in the future, which will promote the development of the PPPM framework for OA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 44801, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Data Sharing Statement", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 44824, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The original data used in this project can be downloaded in the public database GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
