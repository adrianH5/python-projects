Endometriosis reduces women's health-related quality of life (HRQOL), resulting in impairments in physical functioning, diminished social life, difficulties in intimate relationships, and decreased productivity. The endometriosis etiology is complex, involving multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Although the endometriosis pathogenesis is relatively unclear, it is believed to be caused by retrograde menstruation leading to exfoliated endometrium implantation. However, there are limited studies on the development of endometriosis, endometrial-peritoneal attachments, and invasion.

Some studies have identified necroptotic modulators as possible prognostic biomarkers for cancer and certain diseases. Day et al. found that BMI1 in ovarian cancer can participate in the PINK1-Park2-dependent mitochondrial pathway and induce a new type of non-apoptosis cell death mediated by necroptosis. Endometriosis severity is related to apoptosis, which usually destroys ectopic and heterotopic endometrial cells before forming necrotic tissue, thus inhibiting their migration and accumulation.

The screening criteria for enrichment items were P value\u2009<\u20090.05 and FDR value (Q value)\u2009<\u20090.05, which were considered statistically significant. The results demonstrated that 10 NRDEGs (C7, HOOK1, PKP3, AHR, TUFM, GJB1, GSN, MYO6, CLEC7A, and CD74) were mainly enriched in biological processes, such as regulation of lymphocyte activation in endometriosis, response to alcohol, regulation of multi-organism processes, and cellular components (CC), such as endocytic vesicles, clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles, and clathrin-coated vesicle membranes. It was also enriched in molecular function (MF), including MHC protein binding, actin binding, and actin filament binding. We demonstrated GO functional enrichment analysis results using a bubble diagram (Fig.\u00a04A). Furthermore, GO gene functional enrichment analysis results are presented in the network diagram (Fig.\u00a04B). Subsequently, we conducted a GO enrichment analysis of the 10 NRDEGs combined with logFC. Moreover, based on the enrichment analysis, we calculated each molecule's corresponding Z score by the molecule's logFC value in the differential analysis result of the provided molecule in the endometriosis dataset. We present the GO enrichment analysis results of combined logFC using a chord diagram (Fig.\u00a04C). The GO enrichment analysis results are displayed in the form of a Sankey diagram (Fig.\u00a04D), including BP, CC, MF (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function), and their corresponding function or pathway ID (ID) and category ID (ID) including the relationship between the gene names (gene).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22070, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Gene set enrichment analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22099, "infons": {"file": "12905_2023_2668_Fig5_HTML.jpg", "id": "Fig5", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "GSEA enrichment analysis of the endometriosis dataset.

However, its role in the immune response to endometriosis remains unclear. In this study, there were 330 DEGs between 19 endometriosis samples and 19 normal samples in two expression profile datasets (GSE7305 and GSE1169). We intersected the common differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) and necroptosis-related genes in two endometriosis datasets to obtain 10 NRDEGs from endometriosis datasets. The ten NRDEGs were C7, HOOK1, PKP3, AHR, TUFM, GJB1, GSN, MYO6, CLEC7A, and CD74. Among these, PKP3, which belongs to the plakophilin family, promotes tissue integrity. Plakophilins link desmosomal cadherins to intermediate filaments at desmosome junctions, and in common with other catenins, they perform additional functions, including in the nucleus. Gene GJB1 encodes the transmembrane channel protein connexin 32 (Cx32), a member of the Cxs family. Previous studies have disclosed that GJB1 exerts anti-apoptotic and pro-tumor effects by interacting with it. HOOK1, encodes a member of the hook family of coiled-coil proteins that bind to microtubules and organelles via their N-and C-terminal domains, respectively. In the present study, HOOK1 expression was upregulated. Notably, the N-terminal segment of Hook1 has a cytoskeletal protein-binding site that is involved in cell migration and intracellular vesicle trafficking. The mitochondrial translation elongation factor is encoded by the TUFM. Cho et al. suggested that TUFM might be important for CASP8 inhibition via autophagy activation.

Compared to normal endometrium, endometriosis patients have more immune cells, particularly NK and M2 cells. However, the immune cell activation pattern in endometriosis remains unclear. The role of immune cell infiltration in endometriosis needs to be further investigated, and we performed a comprehensive evaluation of immune cell infiltration in endometriosis using CIBERSORT. Our study demonstrated a correlation between the infiltration abundance of NK cells and M2 macrophage immune cells. Moreover, genes were statistically different between the GSE7305 and GSE1169 datasets.

Lagana AS et al. found that the number of M1 and M2 macrophages was significantly higher in the endometriosis group than in controls, regardless of stage. Moreover, M2 macrophages may inhibit the immunological response of NK cells. Reduced NK cell number and function result in reduced cytotoxicity and elimination of ectopic endometrial cells. In our study, the relative genes of NK cell activation were MYO6 and macrophages. M2 represents HOOK1 expression in the two datasets. MYO6 and HOOK1 have a limited impact on the immune system in endometriosis. A macromolecular antigen, ovalbumin, showed high permeability to Rmc monolayers lacking myo6. It still induced strong T-cell activation because it retained antigenicity. In a study by Yu-wei Liao et al., MyO6-deficient RMC monolayers demonstrated high permeability, retaining ovalbumin antigenicity, thereby activating T cells.
