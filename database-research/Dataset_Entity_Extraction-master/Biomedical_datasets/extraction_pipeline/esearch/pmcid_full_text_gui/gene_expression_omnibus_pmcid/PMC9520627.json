Although the etiology of CD remains unclear, accumulating evidence indicates that the initiation of CD is significantly correlated with immunological lesions and the prominent infiltration of immune cells including T lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and plasma cells. Despite its low mortality rate, its high disability rate and expense require systematic healthcare management. The first step for the effective healthcare management of CD is a definitive diagnosis, which is still a big challenge for physicians. Therefore, the development of an effective tool to diagnose CD is urgently required. A predictive model was developed to diagnose CD on the basis of deep machine learning algorithms, which has already been widely applied to the medical field to solve complicated clinical problems.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18188, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the present study, we identified 102 DEGs associated with CD from two publicly available datasets and obtained candidate genes by a random forest classifier. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs suggested a link between inflammatory responses and the occurrence of CD, which was reported previously. Singh et al. found a marked increase in cytokines and chemokines in CD patients compared with control donors, which aggravated intestinal inflammation and injury. Cytokines mediate inflammation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines have a crucial role in regulating intestinal homeostasis. The aim of the targeted treatment of CD is to balance immune responses by modulating pro-inflammation and intensifying anti-inflammation. Furthermore, the top three hub genes in the PPI network were IL-1\u03b2, CCL2, and CXCR2. CCL2 and CXCR2, which belong to different subfamilies of chemokines, functioned as active biomarkers. Li et al. reported that CXCR2, a specific receptor for CXCL2/CXCL5, which are overexpressed in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), promoted the migration of MSCs to sites of damage and achieved good therapeutic effects in an IBD mouse model. Of note, the hub genes based on the PPI network might have an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of CD. Previous investigations indicated that IL-1\u03b2 acted as an inflammasome and was overexpressed in the intestinal mucosa of CD patients.

Innate immunity is an immediate non-specific response, in which pathogens are recognized and innate immune cells include macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells are activated. The intestinal innate immune system protects the mucosa by immune defense and surveillance. Recent research demonstrated that the innate immune response is equally significant as adaptive immunity in CD. In addition to defense against many aggressors, innate immunity also contributes to abnormal immune responses, such as autophagy, innate microbial sensing, and antimicrobial peptide production, which are linked to CD pathogenesis.

S100A8 was the best candidate gene identified by a random forest classifier in our study. A recent study reported that the expression levels of serum biomarkers, including S100A8, were elevated in patients who later had a disease relapse. It was also reported that maintaining the production balance of S100A8 might be involved in intestinal homeostasis. Due to its high efficiency and accuracy, random forest algorithms as a type of ensemble learning method have been successful in the prediction and identification of clinical disease. Wang et al. developed a model to predict coronary artery disease using a random forest algorithm, which had good discrimination abilities. Another study demonstrated that endobronchial optical coherence tomography based on a random forest algorithm was effective for the detection of early malignant pulmonary disease. A recent study reported that Support Vector Machines and multi-layer neural network models were developed to predict a protein\u2019s post translational modification sites, which contributed to solving a difficult problem in the field of molecular biology. ANN have also increasingly been used in gastrointestinal disease because of its outstanding performance in diagnostic and prognostic prediction. In the 1990s, Karakitsos et al. reported the use of ANN to detect malignant gastric lesions with a discrimination performance of 97%. Furthermore, a previous study reported combining machine algorithms to predict the migration of cancer cells. Moreover, a joint machine algorithm of a random forest and ANN contributed to a diagnosis of non-tumor diseases including heart failure. Li et al. also successfully developed a novel diagnostic model for UC integrating a random forest and ANN algorithm. Therefore, corresponding deep machine learning should be applicable for the diagnosis of CD.
