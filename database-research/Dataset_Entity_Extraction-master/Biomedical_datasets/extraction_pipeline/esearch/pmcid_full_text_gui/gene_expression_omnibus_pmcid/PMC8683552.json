According to 2020\u00a0global cancer statistics, more than 310,000 new cases and more than 200,000 deaths worldwide were reported. As early OC is asymptomatic and the fact that the late symptoms of OC are nonspecific, and there is no effective screening method for early OC, the disease is often already at an advanced and incurable stage when it is diagnosed. For decades, the treatment of OC has largely involved surgery and platinum chemotherapy. The survival rate at 5\u00a0years for stage I OC has exceeded 90%, while that of stage III or IV female patients is less than 25%. At present, transvaginal ultrasound and measurement of biomarkers such as CA125 are the two most commonly used screening methods for OC, but according to clinical trials, these two screening methods do not increase the survival rate of patients.

Therefore, by studying the expression level of aging\u2010related genes in tumor tissue, we can identify the subgroup of patients with worse prognosis earlier and carry out corresponding clinical treatment as soon as possible to confer a survival advantage in patients. Recent studies have revealed a model constructed using age\u2010related genes to aid in the prediction of outcome in colorectal cancer patients.

For example, the senescence\u2010associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is not only a tumor suppressor but can also act as a tumor driver. On the one hand, aging cells can induce senescence in adjacent tumor cells through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms by releasing SASP and activate immune surveillance to eliminate senescent and proliferating tumor cells at the same time, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. On the other hand, aging cells can reshape the tumor microenvironment through SASP, promote cell proliferation, and drive tumor angiogenesis, thus promoting tumor progression.

Previously, scholars found that EPS8 was usually overexpressed in advanced thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and pituitary tumors. In our study, compared with normal ovarian tissue, EPS8\u00a0showed low expression in ovarian cancer tissue, which may be related to the heterogeneity of the tumor. EPS8 binds to AbI1 through its SH3 domain, and AbI1 binds EPS8 and SOS1 together, thereby promoting the formation of a trimeric complex that activates Rac. Rac activity is required for the metastasis and colony\u2010forming ability of ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer is closely related to the integrity of the SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 complex. In addition, some scholars have found that the presence of the SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 complex correlated well to the continuous epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics of ovarian cancer cells, and an intact complex is required for this procedure. Therefore, silenced or low expression of EPS8 can reduce the migration and metastatic colonizing ability of ovarian cancer cells. Thus, relatively high expression of EPS8 is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, which is consistent with our research results. Regarding FOXO1, it has long been reported that FOXO1 expression is downregulated in cervical cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer. In ovarian cancer, the progesterone receptor (PR\u2010B) induces cell senescence through FOXO1, and one of the characteristics of aging cells is the upregulation of FOXO1 expression. In our study, we reached the same conclusion that the expression level of FOXO1 is generally downregulated, while the expression level of FOXO1 is relatively higher in high\u2010risk patients, which indicates that patients in the high\u2010risk group are more prone to cell aging. STAT5A is an oncogene. Members of the STAT family are related to the occurrence, progression, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune escape of human cancer. In prostate cancer, some scholars have found that knocking down STAT5A can increase the sensitivity of prostate cancer to radiotherapy and reduce radiation damage to adjacent tissues; in colorectal cancer, inhibition of STAT5A promotes chemotherapy (such as cisplatin or 5\u2010FU)\u2010induced apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells. In terms of immunity, STAT5 plays a key role in the function and development of Tregs, and continuously activated STAT5 can inhibit antitumor immunity and increase the proliferation, invasion, and survival of tumor cells. In our study, STAT5 was a risk factor, and relatively high expression of STAT5 increased the risk score and predicted a poor prognosis. Regarding PAPPA, although we did not find a differential level of PAPP\u2010A expression between normal ovarian tissue and ovarian cancer, there is evidence that the downregulation of the pregnancy\u2010associated plasma protein A (PAPPA) gene can reduce IGF\u2010I\u2010dependent Akt and ERK1/2 activation, thereby reducing the growth, invasion, and metastasis of OC cells. Similarly, it has been found that overexpression of PAPPA in ovarian cancer cells promotes the growth of tumors. According to our results, PAPPA is a risk factor, and the relatively high expression of PAPPA may be one of the reasons for poor prognosis in the high\u2010risk group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34095, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among the protective factors, JAK2 expression has been found to be upregulated in OC tissues after paclitaxel chemotherapy, and its expression is related to the drug resistance mechanism of OC.

Inhibition of JAK2 can reverse the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel. Compared with normal tissues, the expression of JAK2 in OC is downregulated, which may be related to the heterogeneity of the tumor. In tumor tissues, the expression of JAK2 is relatively higher in low\u2010risk patients, which may be caused by chemotherapy and resistance. This point is worthy of further study. Regarding EEF1E1, studies have found that EEF1E1 is overexpressed in most tumors, including ovarian cancer, and that high expression of EEF1G predicts better OS and PFS rates in OC patients, which is consistent with our research results. In addition, in our study, UBB was a protective factor, and the downregulation of UBB predicted a worse prognosis, which is consistent with the conclusion of other studies.

Several previous studies have shed light on the relationship between aging and immunity. The characteristic of aging is graduate senescent immune remodeling termed immunosenescence. For example, the immunosenescence of T cells, including shrinkage of immune repertoire, the exhaustion of memory T cells, and the reduction of immune costimulatory molecules, all of them lead to a significant decline in immune function with aging. One of the main tasks of the human immune system is cancer detection. Mutations or genetic disorders in somatic cells may cause them to be considered foreign antigens. For the elderly, as the age increases, the decline of immune function will reduce the recognition and elimination of these cells, eventually leading to their accumulation. These senescent cells and SASP factors can reprogram the tumor microenvironment into an environment more prone to the growth of malignant cells, which has been proven by a large number of studies. In our study, the expression levels of B cells and CD8+T cells were significantly higher in the low\u2010risk group. As far as we know, CD8+T cells play a pivotal role in controlling tumor cell growth, and prior studies have already demonstrated that CD8+ T cells indicate a better prognosis. Other studies have found that not only does the percentage of peripheral blood B cells decrease with the increase in age, but also their capacity to spontaneously secrete IgM decreases. In contrast, the expression of macrophages was higher in the high\u2010risk group. Some scholars have observed an increase in the number of macrophages in aging adipose tissue; in addition, the increase in macrophages in the lymphatic tissues of elderly individuals was dominated by an increase in immunosuppressive M2\u00a0macrophages.

Senescent fibroblasts with SASP and other stromal components secrete cytokines that promote cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy in a paracrine manner. In addition, research supports the fact that chemotherapy can further induce SASP in tumor, immune, and stromal cells through treatment\u2010induced senescent cells. Therefore, based on our sensitivity analysis, we may be able to draw a conclusion: high\u2010risk populations were more sensitive to platinum\u2010based chemotherapeutics, but due to the development of SASP, they developed drug resistance faster, and finally led to a poor treatment outcome.
