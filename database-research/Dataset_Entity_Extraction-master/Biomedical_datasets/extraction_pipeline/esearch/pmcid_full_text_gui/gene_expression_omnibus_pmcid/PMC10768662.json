When blood flow is restored, reperfusion may exacerbate tissue damage and trigger a severe inflammatory reaction, a phenomenon termed \u201creperfusion injury\u201d. Ischemia-reperfusion injury can provoke various cellular death events, including apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy-associated cell death, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Misfolded proteins bind to BiP and are then degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Ischemia and hypoxia can cause an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER cavity, thus initiating the unfolded protein response (UPR).

The hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) Pathway is one of the longest-studied signals.
