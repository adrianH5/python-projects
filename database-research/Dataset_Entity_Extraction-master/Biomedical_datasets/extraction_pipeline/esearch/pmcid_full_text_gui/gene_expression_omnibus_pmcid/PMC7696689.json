Delayed diagnosis, poor prognosis, and disease heterogeneity make its treatment ineffective. miRNAs are imposingly involved in personalized medicine such as therapeutics, due to their high sensitivity and accuracy. Our study aimed to reveal the biomarkers that may be involved in the dysregulated immune response in sepsis and lung injury using a computational approach and in vivo validation studies. A sepsis miRNA Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset based on the former analysis of blood samples was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and associated hub genes. Sepsis-associated genes from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) that overlapped with identified DEM targets were utilized for network construction. In total, 317 genes were found to be regulated by 10 DEMs (three upregulated, namely miR-4634, miR-4638-5p, and miR-4769-5p, and seven downregulated, namely miR-4299, miR-451a, miR181a-2-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-5704, miR-144-3p, and miR-1290). Overall hub genes (HIP1, GJC1, MDM4, IL6R, and ERC1) and for miR-16-5p (SYNRG, TNRC6B, and LAMTOR3) were identified based on centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and closeness). In vivo validation of miRNAs in lung tissue showed significantly downregulated expression of miR-16-5p corroborating with our computational findings, whereas expression of miR-181a-2-3p and miR-451a were found to be upregulated in contrast to the computational approach. In conclusion, the differential expression pattern of miRNAs and hub genes reported in this study may help to unravel many unexplored regulatory pathways, leading to the identification of critical molecular targets for increased prognosis, diagnosis, and drug efficacy in sepsis and associated organ injuries.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1957, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Mir-16 downregulation as validated in our study was in line with other studies that reported significant downregulation of miR-16 in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury. In contrast, elevated miR-16 levels in septic T cells of patients were shown to downregulate NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and CXCL10, leading to the reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokine in T cells.

Moreover, miR-16 also exerts pro-apoptotic effects in lymphocytes and granulocytes.

Increased levels of anti-inflammatory miR-16 were reported in the sera of surviving sepsis patients as compared to the non-surviving group. In contrast, other studies reported increased miR-16 and miR-451 expression in whole blood of septic mice, and the expression of these miRNAs was not dependent on TLR4, TLR2, or NF-\u03baB-dependent pathways. Variations in expressions of miR-16 and miR-451 in red blood cells are usually the prime cause of alterations in the quantified levels of circulating miR-16 and miR-451. miR-451 regulates ROS generation in macrophages, suggesting that enhanced miR-451 in sepsis-induced lung induces ROS generation in alveolar macrophages. miR-451 regulates a negative cascade via its target YWHAZ protein to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression including TNF, IFN-b, and IL-6. miRNAs\u2019 expression signature may vary depending on causal organisms (Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria); this may thus account for the deviation of results in our validation studies in CLP mice model from the computational analysis. The difference in tissue source used for the quantification of differentially expressed miR may also be the prime cause of the different amount of miR expression obtained in our in vivo validation studies. miR-16 is particularly enriched in the spleen and shows higher expression in non-brain tissues as compared to the brain. For 16-5p, three genes were overlapped in between degree and betweenness (in two modules). These three genes (SYNRG, TNRC6B, and LAMTOR3) were considered as hub genes for miR-16-5p. SYNRG (Synergin \u03b3) is known to play a role in membrane trafficking at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endocytosis. It acts by interacting with the \u03b3 subunit of the AP1 clathrin\u2013adaptor complex. Its role has not yet been elaborated in the context of sepsis. TNRC6B (trinucleotide repeat-containing protein 6B), which was found to be another target hub gene of miR-16, is a member of the GW182 family proteins. It is known as the argonaut-interacting protein, a component of siRNA and miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression of various target mRNAs through a C-terminal silencing domain. TNRC6B has also been previously associated with a possible role in oxidative stress-related mechanisms and a potential target gene of miR-16. LAMTOR3 (MP1), another hub gene target of miR-16 in our study, has been previously shown to be upregulated by mutated lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). Some studies suggest mitogenic signaling activation for ERK and MEK via LAMTOR3, which is a scaffolding protein. LAMTOR3 is rapidly degraded in a lysosome-independent manner and a proteasome-dependent manner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24410, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "miR-181 has been designated as a significant inflammatory response marker in whole blood analysis associated with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Earlier, miR-181a-5p was also reported to be upregulated in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and the LPS-stimulated sepsis mice model. miR-181b expression was reported to be upregulated in early sepsis and sustained in late sepsis. In vivo blockade of miR-181 after sepsis reduced late-sepsis mortality, improved bacterial clearance, and reduced NFI-A expression, which is responsible for myeloid differentiation during sepsis. The levels of creatine (Cr), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) significantly decreased with the miR-181a-5p inhibitor in the serum of mice with sepsis. This was in support of the GO pathway analysis performed in our studies, which also revealed that most of the DEMs in our study were significantly involved in the cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and Importin-\u03b13, a protein critical for NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation, were targeted by miR-181b in vitro and in vivo study models, respectively.

However, no study is available on exploring its role in sepsis-induced inflammation or organ injury. Gap junction \u03b3-1 protein (GJC1), also known as connexin 45 (Cx45) or gap junction \u03b1-7 protein (GJA7), is a protein component of gap junction that is encoded by the GJC1 gene.

Severe systemic inflammation upon infection leads to the production of excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1. IL6R (interleukin-6 receptor) is a transmembrane receptor of IL-6 that, upon binding to IL-6, triggers the classical IL-6 downstream signaling pathway.
