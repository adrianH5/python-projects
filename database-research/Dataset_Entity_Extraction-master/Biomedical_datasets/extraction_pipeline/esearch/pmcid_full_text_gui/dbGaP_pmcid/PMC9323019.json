Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing to compare the cell types and molecular programs between these two regions in the second trimester human placenta. Each region consists of progenitor cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) with similar gene expression programs. While CTBs in the villous chorion differentiate into syncytiotrophoblasts, they take an alternative trajectory in the SC producing a previously unknown CTB population which we term SC-specific CTBs (SC-CTBs). Marked by expression of region-specific cytokeratins, the SC-CTBs form a stratified epithelium above a basal layer of progenitor CTBs. They express epidermal and metabolic transcriptional programs consistent with a primary role in defense against physical stress and pathogens. Additionally, we show that SC-CTBs closely associate with EVTs and secrete factors that inhibit the migration of the EVTs. This restriction of EVT migration is in striking contrast to the villous region where EVTs migrate away from the chorion and invade deeply into the decidua. Together, these findings greatly expand our understanding of CTB differentiation in these distinct regions of the human placenta.

The placenta must begin development rapidly upon conception in order to perform the roles of future organ systems that have not yet developed and matured in the fetus, including nutrient and oxygen transport and protection from mechanical and pathogenic insults. The placenta also performs unique functions such as modulation of maternal tolerance and hormone production. Placental development begins with the generation of stem villi surrounding the entire embryo and then proceeds asymmetrically to produce two distinct regions. At the human implantation site, the embryonic pole, the villi grow and branch to give rise to the region essential for the exchange of gases and nutrients, the chorion frondosum (also known as the chorionic villi or the villous chorion [VC]). This region includes the placental villi and the invasive EVTs. The villi located on the opposite side, the abembryonic pole, degenerate resulting in a smooth surface lacking villi termed the chorion leave (also known as the smooth chorion [SC]).

The CTBs of the SC exist in an epithelial-like structure and lack STBs and proximity to the fetal vasculature, and thus cannot function in a manner comparable to villi in VC. Furthermore, in contrast to the VC where EVTs invade and remodel the maternal arteries, the cells of the SC do not invade the adjacent decidua and the maternal blood vessels it contains.

A comparable number of CTBs in the SC were recovered in, potentially reflecting a difficulty in capturing these cells at term. To better understand the differences in the cell types and functions of the two sides of the developing placenta, we applied scRNA-seq to matching samples of cells isolated from the VC and SC regions of human samples from mid to late in the second trimester. We used scRNA-seq to compare the composition and developmental trajectories of CTBs in the VC and SC. The data were validated and extended with functional studies to gain initial insights into the basis of differential migration of trophoblasts in each region.

Genes that were highly expressed at the start of the pseudotemporal differentiation included pan-trophoblast factors such as EGFR, which was expressed throughout all four CTB populations in both the VC and SC.

In CTB 1, we identified enrichment for WNT signaling, epithelial morphogenesis, and membrane transport, categories commonly associated with progenitors (Figure 4a, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1). We validated the activity of WNT signaling and the location of these cells by immunolocalization of non-phosphorylated CTNNB1 (np-CTNNB1). Staining was localized to the most basal epithelial layer nearest to the stroma in both the VC and SC regions (Figure 4b), matching expression of the CTB 1 marker CDH1 (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2a). WNT signaling has an important role in the maintenance of villous CTBs in vivo and in the derivation and culture of self-renewing human trophoblast stem cells. We investigated proliferation of np-CTNNB1 expressing cells in both regions using KI67 as a mitotic marker. This revealed a similar percentage of KI67+ CTB 1 cells, suggesting similar proliferative capacity across regions (Figure 4b and c). We next analyzed regional differences within CTB 1.

No clusters were specific to the VC or SC, except for the small number of putative EVT Precursors (VC \u2013 99 cells; SC \u2013 8 cells) (Figure 5d, Figure 3a). Previous work has classified EVTs in the VC as columnar, interstitial, or endovascular based on gene expression and location in the decidua. The columnar subpopulation is believed to represent newly differentiated EVTs, which lie at the base of the columns that connect the anchoring villi to the uterine wall. Interstitial EVTs migrate through the decidua homing to maternal arteries, which they invade. The relationship between this subpopulation and endovascular EVTs that replace the maternal arterial endothelium is unclear, with evidence supporting endovascular EVTs arising either from interstitial EVTs and/or an independent origin. We expected to capture both columnar and interstitial EVT populations, but few endovascular EVTs as the cellular preparations were largely devoid of arteries. We investigated the four clusters of EVT identified in our analysis in the context of the VC and the SC. Both regions contained cells from all clusters, although distinct regional biases were evident (Supplementary file 1). The SC region contained almost twice as many EVT 1 cells as the VC (VC \u2013 684; SC \u2013 1256), whereas the VC contained almost twice as many EVT 2\u20134 as the SC (VC \u2013 5789; SC \u2013 3757). We next asked which of the EVT clusters corresponded to known EVT classifications, indicating maturation state or invasive capacity. Gene ontology analysis showed an enrichment for placental development and antigen presentation categories in EVT 1 (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a). Representative marker genes for these categories in EVT 1 included several lineage-specific transcription factors including GCM1, PPARG, and CEBPB (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b). In contrast, EVT 2\u20134 showed enrichment for extracellular structure and matrix organization, glycosylation, and peptidase activity. EVT clusters 3\u20134 specifically showed increased expression for transcripts of proteases such as HTRA1, MMP2, and MMP11 (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c). Based on the GO and specific gene enrichments, EVT 1 appeared most similar to columnar EVTs, while EVT 2\u20134 were consistent with interstitial EVTs that gain invasive capacity. The relative enrichment for EVT 1 in the SC (VC \u2013 10.57% of EVT; SC \u2013 25.05% of EVT) suggested an expansion in columnar-like EVTs at the expense of interstitial EVT. Conversely, the relative enrichment for EVT 2\u20134 in the VC region suggested an expansion of the invasive subpopulation (Figure 5d).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52934, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As almost 75% of EVTs from the SC region were in EVT clusters 2\u20134, we next asked if there were differences in gene expression between interstitial EVTs isolated from each region. This analysis identified relatively few differentially expressed genes, with the vast majority identified having a log fold change less than 1 (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2a; Figure 5\u2014source data 1\u20134). The small number of differentially expressed genes with a fold change greater than 1 was typically identified across multiple EVT clusters, suggesting an overriding transcriptional program that might supersede subcluster designations. To identify genes associated with this program, we combined all EVT subclusters into one cluster for analysis (Figure 5e). Differential expression analysis revealed the hormone CSH1 and several proteases including HTRA1, HTRA4, and PAPPA to be expressed at significantly higher levels in the more invasive VC EVTs. However, of the most differentially expressed transcripts, only CSH1, ITM2C, and DNASE1L3 were exclusive to the VC (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2b). Immunolocalization of CSH1 confirmed this result (Figure 5f). CSH1, also known as human prolactin, is a secreted hormone that signals through the receptor PRLR found on maternal cells. As such, the primary effect of CSH1 is likely non-cell autonomous, raising the possibility that the largest differences in EVTs between regions may not be in inherent invasive capacity, but rather their ability to communicate with the neighboring cells. Therefore, we asked whether differential EVT-stroma signaling interactions exist between the VC and the SC. While this analysis underrepresents the contribution of the stroma due to its depletion by the trophoblast enrichment protocol, we identified enrichment for collagen-integrin interactions between EVT and stromal cells in the VC, which were not present in the SC (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3a). In contrast, SC-specific EVT-stromal interactions included PDGFA and FN1 signaling (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3b).

Since this analysis does not account for cluster heterogeneity or size, we quantified the number of differentially expressed genes between 100 randomly selected cells from each region within each cluster.

Briefly, these cells were enriched using the same protocol as described for the scRNA-seq experiments. The cells were plated on Matrigel-coated transwell filters and cultured for 39 hr. Trophoblast projections that reached the underside of the filter, a proxy for invasion, were visualized by immunostaining with a pan-cytokeratin antibody (Figure 6c, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2). Consistent with the differences observed in vivo, there was greater invasion of VC as compared to SC trophoblast (Figure 6c). Next, we asked whether CTBs from the SC region secreted soluble factors that inhibited invasion. The invasion assays were repeated with VC cells cultured with conditioned medium from SC cells and vice versa. While VC conditioned medium had no impact on either VC or SC cells, SC conditioned medium significantly reduced invasion of VC cells (Figure 6d). Neither conditioned medium impacted the density of VC or SC cells (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3). Therefore, a secreted factor from SC cells inhibited the invasion of VC EVTs. Given that SC-CTBs were the only cell type unique to the SC side, it is highly likely that they produced the secreted factors that inhibit the invasion of EVTs to which they are juxtaposed. To identify which factors might be responsible for the repression of cellular invasion, we subset the predicted signaling interactions between CTB-EVT isolated from the SC (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4). We then subset this analysis for only those containing secreted factors, which identified numerous interactions between CTB 4 and EVTs including both canonical cell signaling pathways (TNFa, PGF, TGFB1, FGF1, and PDGFB) and modifiers of the ECM (FN1 and THBS1) (Figure 6e).

Our study characterized a novel trophoblast population distinct from both extant CTB in the VC and from EVT found in either region. These trophoblasts reside only in stratified epithelium of the SC, express a specific cytokeratin (KRT6), and comprise at least 25% of all trophoblast in the region. Lineage reconstruction by RNA velocity suggested that the progenitors for these SC-specific CTBs are a resident proliferative progenitor trophoblast with a transcriptional profile that matches villous CTB. We identified several potential regulators of the transition from a common villous CTB-like cell to SC-CTB, including epidermal transcription factors such as KLF4 and YAP1.

We confirmed the presence of proliferative trophoblasts in the SC. Each cycling CTB cluster expressed markers of CTB 1\u20134 in both regions (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a) and both CTB 1 (Figure 4b\u2013c) and SC-CTBs (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b) also expressed KI67 protein. Proliferation of both the progenitor and differentiated cells suggested a need for expansion coordinated with the growth of the developing fetus. Second, the importance of the SC was suggested by the noted heterogeneity of the trophoblasts within this region. In agreement, our scRNA-seq results showed the SC to be a complex tissue with several trophoblast types. We identified, by differential transcription and function, at least two distinct CTB cell types, columnar and interstitial EVT, and a small number of STB Precursors. As discussed, all CTB and EVT populations either matched those found in the VC or had new region-specific functions. The only evidence of degeneration was the STB Precursor population within the SC, which lacked expression of both ERVW-1 and ERVFRD-1, the fusogens necessary to form STB.

It will be interesting to explore the impact of advancing gestational age on the SC epithelium, especially with respect to the ECM.

KRT6 is a negative regulator of cell migration through the inhibition of Src kinase and associations with myosin IIA. Finally, this molecule promotes expression of Desmoplakin and the maintenance of desmosomes, the latter, a long-established feature of SC trophoblasts. Taken together, these observations are consistent with data on SC-CTBs. We found no evidence of their invasion, but did identify frequent interactions with the ECM, CTBs, and EVTs. The coordinated expression of these cytokeratins and the transcriptional profile writ large suggested that the SC has the properties of a highly specialized epidermis with a robust proliferative capacity and strong cohesive properties, but lacking migratory or invasive behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 70146, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As previous work has demonstrated or assumed, the majority of trophoblast identified are represented in both the VC and SC. We identified two cell types with striking transcriptional similarity between regions, CTB 1 and EVT. CTB 1 cells in the VC matched canonical villous CTB in transcriptional profile, activity, and niche. We identified a similar population in the SC. They are localized to an epithelial sheet juxtaposed to the fetal stroma, separated by a thin basal lamina. These cells are supported by similar signaling pathways in both regions, including HGF and WNT (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7g). The similarities in location and growth factor requirements demonstrate that a niche similar to the villous trophoblast membrane exists in the SC. Additionally, we identified CTB 1 as the progenitor population for SC-CTB, and possibly for EVT in the SC. Thus, CTB 1 in both regions functions as multipotent progenitors. Despite the many similarities, the developmental trajectories emerging from CTB 1 differ in a region-specific manner. At present, it is unclear whether CTB 1 cells in both regions originally have the same potential or if fate restriction occurs as the fetal membranes form. Future experiments will need to functionally address whether CTB 1 from the VC can be coerced to generate SC-CTBs and if CTB 1 from the SC can efficiently generate STBs and invasive EVTs. Multipotent trophoblasts have been generated from first trimester SC cells, however, these cells have a distinct transcriptional profile from the second trimester cells we characterized.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 71726, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Similarities between the EVT of each region, as defined by contact with the decidua, has been documented in observational, molecular, and most recently, transcriptomic studies. Our data confirmed a strong correlation between gene expression for all EVT populations, regardless of regional identity. Based on previously established EVT subtypes, we identified a reduction in the proportion of interstitial EVTs and a concomitant increase in columnar-like EVTs of the SC. However, we did not find evidence of specific EVT subpopulations or intrinsic gene expression programs that would explain the differences in the depth of invasion of EVT in each region. However, we did uncover CTB-EVT interactions specific to the SC epithelium. Rather than physically separating as they do in the VC, CTBs and EVTs co-occupy the stratified epithelium of the SC, providing a contained environment for paracrine signaling, cell contact-mediated signaling, and cell-ECM interactions that may impact trophoblast invasion. In this study we show that soluble signaling factors from SC cells restrict the invasion of their counterparts from the VC. We can speculate on potential candidates that may function across multiple biological systems to restrict invasion. CTB 4 cells express high levels of TIMP1, TIMP3, and SERPINE1 (PAI-1), which inhibit the function and/or activation of MMPs necessary for trophoblast invasion. Addition of recombinant TIMPs or a function blocking antibody against plasminogen (whose processing is inhibited by SERPINE1) reduced trophoblast invasion in vitro. While these molecules are expressed by decidual cells, we identified their expression within the SC epithelium directly adjacent to EVTs. Another candidate regulator of invasion expressed by CTB 4 is TNF\u03b1. Treatment of trophoblasts with TNF\u03b1 increases EVT apoptosis, decreases protease expression, increases SERPINE1 expression, and decreases invasion in vitro. These data suggest that SC-CTBs secrete multiple molecules that could decrease the survival and invasion of EVTs in the SC. In this study we explored the role of secreted factors, but SC-CTBs may also influence EVTs through cell contact-mediated signaling and the deposition of an ECM distinct from the basal plate. Future experiments will be necessary to explore the contributions of these distinct signaling pathways and matrices.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 74099, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, this study provides a high-resolution molecular accounting of the trophoblast that occupy SC.

We characterized a novel CTB population, marked by KRT6A expression, that is central to three key functions of the SC: formation of an epidermal-like barrier, blockage of aberrant STB differentiation, and restriction of EVT invasion.

We compared our trophoblast data to data from the VC of first trimester placentas from Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 and to data from the VC and SC of term placentas from Pique-Regi et al., 2019. First, we performed pairwise comparisons of the populations recovered in each of these studies, to identify which cell types were common among studies (Figure 2-S1d and f). This demonstrated the transcriptome of CTB 4 (and to a lesser extent CTB 3) not to be correlated with populations found in either Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 or Pique-Regi et al., 2019. Additionally, this analysis identified a strong correlation between the EVT populations identified in each dataset. EVT identified in Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 (first trimester) showed a stronger correlation with the less mature EVT populations in our dataset, while EVT identified in Pique-Regi et al., 2019 (term) demonstrated strong correlation with the most mature EVT clusters (2-4) in our data. To investigate this with higher resolution we integrated the data from each dataset with our own. Integration of the data from Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 show first trimester EVTs (including cells FAC sorted from HLA-G protein expression) align with our EVT 1 population. This suggests these first trimester EVTs resemble the least mature EVTs in our data and lack several features of invasive cells. Integration of the data from Pique-Regi et al., 2019 show strong similarity to those identified in our dataset. The cells isolated from the SC at term appear restricted to the less invasive EVT clusters in our dataset.

Although it can be beneficial to regress out cell cycle related genes to remove factors which obscure cell identity, we did not remove cell cycle genes from our analysis for two reasons. First, cell cycle is an important component of cell fate and identity. This is especially true in the placenta as both commitment to EVT and STB lineages is inextricably tied to cell fate (Lu et al., 2017; Genbacev et al., 1997). Therefore, we determined that excluding information relating to cell cycle state might decrease the ability to identify determinants of cell fate. The S-phase and G2/M-phase CTB containing cells expressing markers of CTB 1-4 clusters, motivated the analysis of proliferation by KI67 staining (Figure 4b and Figure 3-S1b) that demonstrates that CTB 4 cells remain proliferative. This sets this population apart from both EVT and STB. Second, the majority of CTB identified in our analysis do not contain markers of S or G2/M phase transcripts.
