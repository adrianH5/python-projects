Two signaling networks were identified downstream of PKA: RAS/MAPK components and an Aurora Kinase A (AURKA)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) sub-network with activity toward MYC oncoproteins. Findings were validated in two PKA-dependent cancer models: a novel, patient-derived fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) line that expresses a DNAJ-PKAc fusion and a PKA-addicted melanoma model with a mutant type I PKA regulatory subunit. We identify PKA signals that can influence both de novo translation and stability of the proto-oncogene c-MYC. However, the primary mechanism of PKA effects on MYC in our cell models was translation and could be blocked with the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin.

PKA is controlled by cyclic AMP (cAMP) generated by the activation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Genomic alterations in the components of the GPCR-PKA signaling pathway lead to constitutive activation of this kinase in many human diseases including cancer, such as amplified ligands of upstream GPCRs, point mutations in the G-protein subunit GNAS, inactivation of PKA regulatory protein PKA-RI\u03b1, and mutations that directly alter the activity of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAc). Elevated PKA activity as a consequence of GNAS or PRKACA mutations has been reported in a variety of endocrine tumors. A prototypical example is the PRKACA L205R mutation, which generates an unregulated PKAc variant found in adrenocortical and ACTH(Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)-producing pituitary tumors in patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Patients with germline inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A are predisposed to develop myxomas, thyroid, and gonadal tumors, referred to as Carney Complex. Recently, a DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion has emerged as the dominant oncogenic event in a rare liver cancer, fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). This genetic lesion is found in 79\u2013100% of FLC, with rare cases instead bearing PRKAR1A deletion.

Thus, a better understanding of the essential downstream PKA targets in individual tumor types is a more tractable path for therapeutic development.

While a valuable feature of our genetic approach to modulate PKA signaling is the lack of off-target effects seen with commonly used PKA-modulating tool compounds, PKA signaling is well known to be precisely spatiotemporally regulated and our overexpression systems do not allow compartmentalized control of PKA signaling. We also note that while our FLX1 cells provide unique insight into the biology of FLC, they have significant limitations. Their long doubling time posed significant challenges in generating stably engineered cell lines, particularly with knockdown of growth mechanisms. Similarly, the FLX1 has proven more resistant to siRNA than our other exemplar line, Colo741 (Figure 6D), particularly when treated with individual rather than pooled siRNAs. Furthermore, our FLC clinical samples and the FLX1 cell line expressed both c-MYC and n-MYC. However, expression of n-MYC was quite low in FLX1, and it was not possible to clearly assess its regulation and contribution to FLC growth. Thus, the development of more precisely engineered PKA-driven cancer cell models is essential to provide genetic validation for the mechanisms that we have outlined using signaling and small molecule inhibitors, with more FLC cell models specifically also needed to confirm dependency on MYC proteins for proliferation. Such models would also enable detailed characterization of the biochemical methods by which PKA can influence mRNA translation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44373, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This manuscript reports a network map of signaling downstream of oncogenic PKA. We use functional studies to prioritize signaling mediators for their effect on cell growth in PKA-driven cancers, with a focus on FLC models. While our focus in this study has been on FLC, the systems-level mapping of PKA effects in cancer may have distinct implications for other tumor types. This may include a more significant role for PKA effects on c-MYC stability, including via AURKA and PIM2. Whereas FLC has few secondary mutations, the common co-occurrence of PKA-activating mutations with those impacting RAS/MAPK signaling suggests that PKA effects on other targets such as the SIK kinases may also have a more important role in other cancers. Similarly, PKA activation in APC-mutant colorectal cancer could exert important effects on CTNNB1 via inhibition of GSK3. Finally, given PKA\u2019s role in metabolism, its analysis in patient-derived tissues may yield additional nuance. In FLC, our results identify zotatifin as a potential mechanism-driven therapy for FLC and other PKA-driven cancers but require in vivo validation in multiple models to confirm their relevance. With more study, it may be possible to provide proof of concept that targeting MYC by inhibiting its translation is a potential treatment for patients with FLC or other PKA-driven cancers, for whom few options currently exist.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45765, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Materials and methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45787, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Cell culture reagents and treatment", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45823, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Human bladder 639V cells (DSMZ #ACC 413), human skin Colo741 cells (ECACC 93052621), and human thyroid ML1 (DSMZ #ACC 464) cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 U/ml).

Lysate were separated by 10% TGX gels (Biorad), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% milk in TBST using standard technique. Blocked membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against following targets separately: PKAC-\u03b1 (CST#4782), c-MYC (CST#18583), n-MYC (CST#84406), or Actin (Sigma#A5441). Afterward, blotted membranes were washed in TBST, incubated with appropriate HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), washed as before, and developed using ECL (Thermo Fisher) on an iBright FL1000.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67718, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Materials availability", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67741, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We will share all renewable reagents including plasmids, cell lines as well as assay methods, and protocols with the scientific community at large upon direct request to our laboratory.

Serine 62 is a priming site for GSK-3 to phosphorylate Threonine 58, which then recruits SCF(Fbxw7) to degrade MYC so the Serine 62 site is a high-probability candidate residue for PKA regulation by one or both of these downstream pathways. Interestingly, GSK3 is in the same node as AURKA in the authors analyses (Figure 2E), although \u03b1 is increased and \u03b2 decreased. Further interrogation on the site of phosphorylation would add weight to the authors model.

Serine 62 is a priming site for GSK-3 to phosphorylate Threonine 58, which then recruits SCF(Fbxw7) to degrade MYC so the Serine 62 site is a high-probability candidate residue for PKA regulation by one or both of these downstream pathways.

Further interrogation on the site of phosphorylation would add weight to the authors model.
