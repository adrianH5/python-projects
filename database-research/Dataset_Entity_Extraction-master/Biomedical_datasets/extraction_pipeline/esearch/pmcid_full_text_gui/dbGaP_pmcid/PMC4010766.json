A particular strength of GWAS is that it is unbiased with respect to specific genomic elements (e.g., coding or regulatory regions of genes), and it has revealed important associations that would have never been suspected based on prior knowledge or assumptions. To date, the discovered SNPs associated with complex human traits tend to have small effect sizes, requiring very large sample sizes to achieve robust statistical power. To address these issues, a number of efficient strategies have emerged for conducting GWAS, including combining study results across multiple studies using meta-analysis, collecting cases through electronic health records, and using samples collected from other studies as controls that have already been genotyped and made publicly available (e.g., through deposition of de-identified data into dbGaP or EGA). In certain scenarios, it may be attractive to use already genotyped controls and divert resources to standardized collection, phenotyping, and genotyping of cases only. This strategy, however, requires that careful attention be paid to the choice of \u201cpublic controls\u201d and to the comparability of genetic data between cases and the public controls to ensure that any allele frequency differences observed between groups is attributable to locus-specific effects rather than to a systematic bias due to poor matching (population stratification) or differential genotype calling (batch effects). The goal of this paper is to describe some of the potential pitfalls in using previously genotyped control data. We focus on considerations related to the choice of control groups, the use of different genotyping platforms, and approaches to deal with population stratification when cases and controls are genotyped across different platforms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2114, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2127, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used in recent years as a tool for identifying susceptibility loci for a number of complex human traits and, in particular, multifactorial diseases. Indeed, the NHGRI-maintained Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies includes 1788 publications and 12,329 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)-trait associations as of 1/10/2013 (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) (Hindorff et al.,).

As more and more genotype data are being made publicly available through various databases such as the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) or the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), an alternative approach to increase the statistical power of a study at no extra cost is to devote available clinical and genotyping resources almost entirely to cases and use publicly available data from already genotyped samples as controls. Using available controls may be particularly attractive for registry-based studies from which a large number of cases can be rapidly identified. While this strategy has the obvious benefit of allocating scarce resources toward genotyping a larger number of cases, it can also introduce potential bias into the experimental design leading to spurious associations if not applied carefully. For example, control populations must be comparable to cases in terms of ancestry so that any allele frequency differences observed between cases and controls can be attributed to disease susceptibility loci and not just to differences in ancestral background between the two populations (i.e., population stratification). Ascertainment of the population to be used as controls is also critical. For example, a study of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration could recruit participants at high LDL (a risk factor for stroke) as well as low LDL (not a risk factor); thus, inclusion of all participants as controls could introduce a different bias in the comparison with cases. Equally important is the requirement that genotyping quality and allele calls be comparable between the two groups. Even minor differences in genotype calling, possibly attributable to a laboratory or technician bias, may translate into subtle but systematic differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls that can result in false positive associations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4792, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The goal of this paper is to describe some of the potential pitfalls in using previously genotyped control data.
