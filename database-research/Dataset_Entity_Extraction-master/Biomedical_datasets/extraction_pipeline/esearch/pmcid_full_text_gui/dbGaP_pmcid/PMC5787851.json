The CHARGE Principles of Collaboration committed to broad sharing of GWAS results. It was reported, however, that public posting of summary results could, under certain conditions, be used to identify individuals in contributing studies. In response, the NIH moved large-scale GWAS summary results behind the IRB protection of the NCBI database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP). Although p-values could be safely released, public posting of detailed GWAS results decreased dramatically. This decreased posting of GWAS results led to investigators requesting \u201clook-ups\u201d of analytic results, a tedious process for both authors and investigators.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1055, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here, we describe the CHARGE Summary Results page, the result of a joint project between the CHARGE consortium and dbGaP to allow public dissemination of GWAS summary statistics without the requirement for approval from a data access committee (DAC). Journals are now mandating deposition of results and data as part of the publication process. With an interest in creating a stable repository, CHARGE and dbGaP have developed a mechanism that protects participant confidentiality yet provides widespread data sharing through public posting of limited association information for each variant (See Accession codes for the dbGaP accession number for the CHARGE Summary Results page).

The CHARGE Summary site provides information that can be viewed without Data Access Request (DAR) approval by a Data Access Committee DAC, providing for each phenotype and SNP rsID: (1) the \u201ccoding allele\u201d, (2) the effect size (no direction) and (3) the p-value from the meta-analysis. In this way, based upon current dbGaP guidelines, genetic association data of interest to the scientific community is widely available while protecting the privacy of study participants.

For each SNP, GWAS-specific results were combined using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. All studies conducted linear (or logistic or Cox) regression analysis using an additive genetic model.

The downloadable results also include the effect size (with direction of association), its 95% confidence interval, and the coded allele frequency for each SNP. The investigator can delve more deeply into the results and access additional genomic data resources by linking the analysis to association results in the Genome Browser (Supplementary Fig. 3). The initial view of the results in the Genome Browser (Supplementary Fig. 3) provides association results, color-coded in a heat map (red is \u2013log(p) > 10, or p < 1\u00d710\u221210). A threshold determining which SNP results to visualize can be established with a pull-down tab, restricting the results to those with a specific value (e.g., p<1\u00d710\u22128). Interactive features of the Genome Browser include the ability to explore results by movement of the mouse over the region (Supplementary Fig. 3, on the red area) to link to other components that provide views including other SNPs in that region as well as details of the individual SNP association results, gene structures and additional customizable tracks (Supplementary Fig. 4). Further exploration of annotations (e.g., splicing) and links to other portals are available. These available results are summaries from meta-analysis; thus, no individual-level data from the studies are directly accessible, either from public or controlled access. In contrast, the genomic data-sharing beacons using multiple SNP queries of individual-level data have been implicated in privacy risks. Indiscriminate use of this dbGaP site may result in publication bias, as investigators may fail to pursue publication if their specific SNPs do not attain support. However, these GWAS results are made available in order to better focus research without inhibiting publication of results.

In summary, the CHARGE consortium has utilized meta-analysis to permit analysis of data across studies to adhere to limits of individual-level data sharing, an approach that improves statistical power to detect genomic regions associated with disease, biomarkers and risk factors. The development of the dbGaP CHARGE Summary Results site provides open access to the fundamental association results for a genotyped SNP and phenotype. With controlled access, an approved investigator has a full range of results and links to useful tools to enhance research. Open access to summary statistics in dbGaP provides detailed et non-identifiable research results.
