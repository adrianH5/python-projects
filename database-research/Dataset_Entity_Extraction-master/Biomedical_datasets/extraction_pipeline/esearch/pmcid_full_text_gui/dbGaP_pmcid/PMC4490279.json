GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation also attenuates the reinforcing properties of alcohol in rodents. The present translational study is based on four human genetic association studies and one preclinical study providing data that support the hypothesis that GLP-1R may have a role in the pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Case\u2013control analysis (N=908) was performed on a sample of individuals enrolled in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intramural research program. The Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) sample (N=3803) was used for confirmation purposes. Post hoc analyses were carried out on data from a human laboratory study of intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA; N=81) in social drinkers and from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in alcohol-dependent individuals (N=22) subjected to a Monetary Incentive Delay task. In the preclinical study, a GLP-1R agonist was evaluated in a mouse model of alcohol dependence to demonstrate the role of GLP-1R for alcohol consumption. The previously reported functional allele 168Ser (rs6923761) was nominally associated with AUD (P=0.004) in the NIAAA sample, which was partially replicated in males of the SAGE sample (P=0.033). The 168Ser/Ser genotype was further associated with increased alcohol administration and breath alcohol measures in the IV-ASA experiment and with higher BOLD response in the right globus pallidus when receiving notification of outcome for high monetary reward. Finally, GLP-1R agonism significantly reduced alcohol consumption in a mouse model of alcohol dependence.

Specifically, we present five complementary studies, that is, four human genetic association studies investigating the genetics of GLP-1R in the context of AUD, and one preclinical study examining the role of GLP-1R agonism in a mouse model of alcohol dependence. First, we tested whether genetic variation in GLP1R is associated with AUD in participants enrolled at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Laboratory of Clinical and Translational Studies (LCTS).

Voluntary drinking sessions started 30\u2009min before the start of the dark phase of the circadian cycle. Once stable baseline drinking was established, mice were separated into two groups.

In addition, the results of the \u03c72 analyses suggested linear trends in allele frequencies across the three groups. Consequently, we applied the Cochran\u2013Armitage test and found that the results remained significant for all SNPs, with P-values even smaller than those reported for the \u03c72 analyses. To investigate whether non-smoking AUD and smoking AUD subjects differed in AUD severity, we performed a linear regression using group as the independent factor, and, as the dependent factor, we used number of heavy drinking days (defined as \u2a7e4/5 drinks per day for women/men) during a 90-day-period as reported in the timeline follow-back self-report questionnaire, controlling for age and gender. We found significantly more heavy drinking days in the smoking AUD subjects (F(3,568)=13.5, B=11.6, P<0.001).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23142, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "SAGE study (Study 2)", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23163, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "None of the SNPs nominally associated with AUD in the LCTS study were associated with affection status in SAGE when the whole sample was investigated.

Although the affinity for a range of GLP-1 agonists was unaffected by genotype, the efficacy of agonist response was lower for the 168Ser variant, presumably because of its lower expression. Seemingly in agreement with the in vitro findings, the 168Ser allele was associated with lower insulin response following GLP-1 infusion in healthy volunteers and with lower metabolic/cardiovascular biomarkers in obese females. Furthermore, a haplotype uniquely including the 168Ser allele was associated with significantly better response to perphenazine and worse response to olanzapine, providing support for potential pharmacogenetic interactions.

This, in turn, may moderate responses to alcohol, and/or motivation to consume it. As human genetic association studies are fraught with numerous potential confounds, we validated our findings using two human experimental paradigms conducted in rigorous and well-controlled conditions. As a first step toward functional validation in humans, we found that with increased number of the GLP1R 168Ser alleles, subjects self-administered alcohol to a higher level as indicated by increased average and peak BrAC and increased number of subjects reaching a BrAC of 80\u2009mg%. This observation provides an intriguing, albeit preliminary, indication that the 168Ser GLP1R variant influences alcohol-drinking behavior, which in turn may predispose towards AUD as seen in the case\u2013control analyses. We can only speculate on the mechanism underlying this relationship; however, given the previous in vitro functional report for the 168Ser allele, we postulate that decreased function of the SNP attenuates the regulatory properties of GLP-1R, including alcohol intake as demonstrated in preclinical studies, (present Study 5) leading to alcohol self-administration and increased susceptibility for AUD. As a second step toward functional validation in humans, we found that alcohol-dependent individuals carrying the 168Ser allele had significantly higher BOLD signal than the homozygote group carrying the complementary allele at the globus pallidus when receiving notification of reward. Human neuroimaging studies have shown that the globus pallidus is related to reward processing, which is consistent with preclinical studies indicating its involvement in reward via ventral striatal dopaminergic projections to the globus pallidus. Given the positive correlation between reward-related mesolimbic activations and striatal dopamine release, these fMRI results, though preliminary, suggest that those carrying the risk allele may have a more dysfunctional reward system that contributes to their higher vulnerability to AUD. Notably, the globus pallidus has a high concentration of GLP-1 binding sites in the human brain. Although speculative, these preliminary data are consistent with recent work suggesting that activation of GLP-1R modulates dopamine signaling, which in turn is dysregulated in AUD.

Therefore, our human analyses were a priori limited to the gene encoding the receptor. Consistent with our hypothesis and the results obtained in these human experiments, we found converging evidence in a mouse model of alcohol dependence where pharmacological GLP-1R agonism via an exendin-4 analog (AC3174) significantly reduced alcohol consumption.

(b) AC3174 treatment #2 (alcohol intake during test cycle 6): there was a significant main effect of group (P<0.001), with EtOH mice consuming a greater amount of alcohol than CTL mice. ANOVA failed to indicate a main effect of treatment or group \u00d7 treatment interaction. (c) AC3174 treatment #3 (alcohol intake during test cycle 7): ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of group (P<0.00001) and a significant group \u00d7 treatment interaction (P<0.025). Post hoc comparisons indicated that, as expected, EtOH mice injected with vehicle consumed more alcohol than CTL mice. In addition, all doses of AC3174 significantly reduced drinking compared with the vehicle condition in EtOH mice, while AC3174 treatment did not significantly alter alcohol intake in nondependent CTL mice. Further, AC3174 treatment abolished the difference in alcohol intake between EtOH and CTL conditions. (d) Placebo (washout) test #1 (alcohol intake during test cycle 8): all mice were treated with saline (drug-washout test) to substantiate the apparent efficacy of AC3174 to reduce escalated alcohol drinking in dependent mice. ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of group (P<0.00001) and a significant group \u00d7 treatment interaction (P<0.01). Post hoc comparisons supported the expected greater alcohol intake in EtOH compared with CTL mice that continued to receive vehicle. A similar profile of results was obtained in mice that received the lowest AC3174 dose (0.03\u2009\u03bcg\u2009kg\u22121) in the previous test cycle. However, EtOH mice that received 0.10 or 0.30\u2009\u03bcg\u2009kg\u22121 AC3174 doses in the previous test period continued to consume significantly less alcohol compared with mice that previously received vehicle, and their lower level of intake was similar to that exhibited by the corresponding CTL groups. (e) Placebo (washout) test #2 (alcohol intake during test cycle 9): ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of group (P<0.001), but no effect of treatment or an interaction between group \u00d7 treatment during this second washout test period. These results indicate that after a second week of placebo (saline) treatment, elevated drinking in EtOH compared with CTL mice was restored in all the test groups. *P<0.05, significantly different
