In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of approved treatments for men with CRPC. However, none of these therapies is curative, and there is a significant need for new agents. Many of these treatments target the androgen receptor (AR) and the AR signaling pathway (androgen receptor signaling inhibitors, ARSI); thus, the development of persistent AR activity is a common mechanism of resistance to these agents. AR amplifications, structural rearrangements, and mutations are the most frequent genomic alterations in CRPC after treatment with ARSIs. Expression of AR splice variants (AR-V), including AR-V7 and AR-V9, is associated with primary resistance and reduced overall survival (OS) in patients treated with ARSIs. Given the difficulties associated with ARSI resistance, new therapeutic strategies that focus on targets outside the AR signaling axis are critically needed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3641, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recent advances in drug development strategies, including antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC), targeted radionuclide therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T or NK cells, present new modalities for targeting cell surface antigens overexpressed in human cancers. Trophoblastic cell-surface antigen (TROP-2), first identified as a cell surface marker for trophoblast cells with significant homology to EPCAM, has been identified as a potential target in solid tumors. TROP-2 can be detected in a number of normal tissues, including epithelium of breast, liver, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland, and uterus, although toxicities in a randomized phase III trial in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were predominantly nausea (57%), diarrhea (59%), neutropenia (63%), and rash (46%; ref.). However, TROP-2 is overexpressed in many human epithelial cancers, including prostate, breast, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, cervical, urothelial, and ovarian carcinomas. This expression pattern has led to the investigation of TROP-2 as a potential target for the treatment of multiple cancers. Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) was the first FDA-approved approach to target TROP-2, but others, including datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-Dxd), are in clinical trials. SG is an ADC that targets TROP-2 and is composed of an anti\u2013TROP-2\u2013humanized antibody (RS7) linked by a moderately stable carbonate bond to SN-38, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, and the active metabolite of irinotecan. Clinical trials with SG have demonstrated its efficacy in multiple cancer types, and SG has recently been approved for TNBC and urothelial cancer. A second ADC, Dato-Dxd, also targets TROP-2 and is in trials for TNBC and non\u2013small cell lung cancer. Preclinical data have demonstrated TROP-2 expression in prostate cancer in both primary and metastatic sites, suggesting that TROP-2\u2013targeted therapies may display significant efficacy in men with this disease.

Previous studies have shown that TROP-2 protein is detectable by IHC in nearly all prostate cancer biopsy samples and that TROP-2 is upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer tissue compared with localized disease. Using RNA-seq data, we have previously curated from 634 mCRPC samples across four separate cohorts, we compared TACSTD2 expression from tumors classified as adenocarcinoma or NEPC in published studies. Patients with adenocarcinoma were sub-classified as luminal or basal, and we observed that tumors from patients with adenocarcinoma (luminal or basal) had significantly higher TACSTD2 than tumors from patients with NEPC (Fig. 1A; ref.). Interestingly, we also identified a smaller but significant increase in TACSTD2 expression in tumors classified as luminal-like compared with that in basal-like tumors (Fig. 1B). We performed a Spearman correlation between TACSTD2 and other cell surface targets identified by Lee and colleagues) in prostate cancer adenocarcinoma in our cohort, and all genes were positively correlated with TACSTD2 supporting TROP-2 as a target for ADCs, CAR-T, or radioligand therapies in prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also analyzed TACSTD2 expression in a cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Most patients exhibited TACSTD2 expression regardless of biopsy site. However, analysis of TACSTD2 expression at different sites in this metastatic cohort revealed that tumors from the primary site (prostate) had higher expression of TACSTD2 than distant (non-lymph node) metastases (P = 0.044, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and lymph node metastases (P = 0.029, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 1C). However, primary and metastatic samples were not always from the same subjects, and there may be differences in prior treatment history, aggressiveness or patient demographics that could drive cancer heterogeneity and/or evolution. We performed survival analysis of the samples from patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma for which survival data were available (N = 195). For the Cox proportional hazard model in the survival analysis, TACSTD2 expression was scaled by dividing each value by the SD of TACSTD2 expression, thus a unit change of 1 represents a single SD in TACSTD2 expression. This analysis found that lower TACSTD2 expression was correlated with lower OS (Cox proportional hazard model on continuous TACSTD2 expression P = 0.0118; HR, 0.8218; 95% CI, 0.7053\u20130.9574; Fig. 1D).

We assessed TACSTD2 expression in the four published mCRPC datasets described above and found no significant difference between ARSI-na\u00efve patients and those who had previously received ARSI therapy (Fig. 2A; P = 0.18, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To assess whether specific mechanisms of resistance to ARSI result in decreased TACSTD2, we first asked whether the presence of AR alterations affected TACSTD2 expression. The four mCRPC datasets described above contained information on AR mutations and AR copy-number gains. Given the difference in TACSTD2 expression observed between prostate adenocarcinomas (luminal and basal) and NEPC (Fig. 1A), we stratified the data by these categories when comparing TACSTD2 expression according to AR alteration status to avoid bias by subtype. We found no significant difference in TACSTD2 expression in samples with or without an AR alteration within adenocarcinoma (P = 0.57, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), NEPC (P = 0.97, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), luminal (P = 0.96, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), or basal (P = 0.18, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), subtypes, indicating that AR mutations or copy-number gains had no effect on TACSTD2 expression (Fig. 2B and C). The presence of AR splice variants, including AR-V7, in CTCs has been shown to be predictive of resistance to ARSI. The PROMOTE study assessed AR variant RNA levels in tissue biopsies and allowed us to examine the correlation between AR variants and TACSTD2 expression. Interestingly, we found that when samples collected at baseline (n = 90) were divided into AR-V7\u2013negative, AR-V7\u2013low, and AR-V7--high tertiles, TACSTD2 expression was highest in the group with the highest level of AR-V7 and lowest in the AR-V7\u2013negative group (Fig. 2D). Because we did not detect decreased expression of TACSTD2 in AR-V7\u2013positive tumors these data suggest that TROP-2 could be a viable therapeutic target in AR-V7\u2013positive prostate cancers. These observations led us to investigate the pathways associated with TACSTD2 expression. Using the data from the four CRPC datasets described above, we performed GSEA against a list of hallmark pathways and observed that the androgen response pathway was the most highly enriched pathway among TACSTD2-correlated genes (Fig. 2E and F).

At the time of the blood draw, the patient was being treated with ADT with slowly increasing serum PSA levels. This patient developed new symptoms of disease progression, and restaging scans identified progressive disease with new bone, lymph node, liver, and lung metastases. A liver biopsy was performed, which showed small-cell carcinoma of prostate origin with expression of synaptophysin (SYP) and chromogranin A (CHGA). CTCs were isolated using antibodies against EPCAM or TROP-2 as described above, and these CTCs were also stained for the expression of EPCAM and TROP-2 proteins on the surface of the cells (Fig. 4A). More CTCs were captured with EPCAM antibodies (606 CTCs) than with TROP-2 antibodies (380 CTCs). In CTCs captured with anti-EPCAM, we identified a distinct population of cells characterized by very high EPCAM expression (>1,000 MFI) that was not present in TROP-2\u2013captured CTCs. The median EPCAM MFI was 2510 in the EPCAM-captured specimen and 179 in the matched TROP-2 captured specimen (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B).

Resistance to ARSIs, the backbone of systemic therapy for this disease, is widespread. Therefore, new therapies for the treatment of mCRPC are required. TROP-2 has emerged as a promising target outside the AR signaling axis and has been successfully used as a drug target in other malignancies. However, its effectiveness as a target for mCRPC remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrated the feasibility of using TROP-2 as a target for mCRPC therapies and its utility for isolating CTCs to monitor the response in patients with mCRPC. We found that TROP-2 was expressed in the majority of mCRPC cases. Although expression is lower in the more aggressive NEPC subtype, there is a wide range, with some tumors still demonstrating retained expression. In addition, prior ARSI treatment or the presence of AR-modulating mutations did not significantly affect the expression of TACSTD2, and AR-V7 positivity may be associated with greater expression of TACSTD2, suggesting that agents targeting TROP-2 would be minimally affected by ARSI resistance status. Finally, mouse xenograft models demonstrated that labeled TROP-2 antibody specifically targets mCRPC tumors and that conjugating TROP-2 to a radioisotope is effective at decreasing tumor burden. These results demonstrate that targeting TROP-2 is a feasible strategy for the treatment of mCRPC and warrants further analysis in clinical trials.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46044, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "ADCs, including SG and Dato-Dxd, were developed to target TROP-2. Both drugs are composed of an anti\u2013TROP-2 antibody linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor, which induces double-stranded DNA breaks, leading to apoptosis. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of SG in TNBC and urothelial cancer, which led to the approval of SG for these two cancer types. A Phase I/II multicenter, single-arm basket trial (NCT01631552) evaluated the efficacy of SG in patients with advanced epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. The ORR varies across different cancer types. In patients with prostate cancer, there was evidence of a clinical response in a small cohort consisting of patients with heavily pretreated disease and some patients with NEPC (n = 11). One patient had a complete response, and the trial demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 27.3% in patients with prostate cancer. However, more patients are needed to assess the efficacy in prostate cancer and to target this therapy in patients most likely to respond. Our observation that TROP-2 is expressed in patients with mCRPC before and after treatment with AR-targeted therapies suggests that TROP-2\u2013targeted therapies may be beneficial to patients whose disease develops resistance to second-generation AR-targeted therapy and serve as a target for future drug development. Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between TACSTD2 expression and the expression AR-V7, indicating that patients with mCRPC who have progressed on ARSI treatment via this mechanism might benefit from agents targeting TROP-2. To address these hypotheses, we began a phase II clinical trial (NCT03725761) to assess the effectiveness of SG in patients with mCRPC who have progressed on abiraterone or enzalutamide.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47819, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although SG has shown clinical benefits for patients with various malignancies, not all patients respond to treatment, and resistance has been reported. The identification and analysis of predictors of response have been challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining metastatic biopsies. The capture of CTCs represents a source of biological material that can inform the status of the tumor through minimally invasive liquid biopsy. Enumeration and gene expression analysis of these rare CTCs are prognostic when captured with EPCAM, and our results suggest that we can also capture TROP-2\u2013positive CTCs using a similar approach. Molecular analysis of TROP-2\u2013positive CTCs could provide a potential companion biomarker for the evaluation of TROP-2 ADC clinical trials in prostate cancer. We hypothesized that TROP-2 positivity and protein expression may correlate with response and resistance. A liquid biomarker for TROP-2 may identify patients most likely to benefit from TROP-2\u2013targeted therapies and help guide future clinical trials.
