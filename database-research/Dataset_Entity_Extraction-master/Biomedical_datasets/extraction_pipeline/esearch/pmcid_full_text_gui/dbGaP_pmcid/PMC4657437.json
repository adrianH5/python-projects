Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and many other diseases that are leading causes of death, disability, and health care expenditure in the United States. Tremendous public investment has been made into finding genetic determinants of obesity, most recently in the form of GWAS (genome-wide association studies). GWAS studies have resulted in the discovery of many associated genetic loci; for instance, the GIANT consortium has discovered or validated a total of 32 SNPs associated with body mass index (BMI).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1766, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While many successes in the genetics of obesity have occurred, the overall assessment of the contribution of GWAS remains controversial, largely due to the lack of translation of basic scientific discoveries into improved health outcomes for patients. There are several possible reasons for this failure. One is that the overall explained variance of the discovered loci is not high. For instance, only 1-2% of the variance of BMI is explained by the 32 loci found in the GIANT study, and thus most of the genetic variation in obesity remains undiscovered. However, there are examples in many GWAS studies in which discovered genetic variants, even of small effect, yield new insight into the pathophysiology of disease. For instance, in Type II diabetes (T2D), while only 10% of the disease heritability is accounted for by the set of discovered genetic variants, novel pathways have been discovered with previously-unknown roles in T2D, and the role of \u03b2-cell dysfunction in T2D has been highlighted as a result of these studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2801, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For GWAS of BMI, some of the newly-discovered variants are in genes expressed in the central nervous system, and key hypothalamic pathways of energy balance are potentially implicated. However, many of the discovered variants are in or near genes that are poorly-understood with unknown genetic mechanisms. In order to translate discovered genetic variants into new therapies or prevention strategies, first molecular and/or physiological mechanisms of each variant needs to be discovered. However, it is difficult to know how to explore potential genetic risk mechanisms, especially when little is known about a gene.

The goal of BN learning algorithms is to find a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) which represents the true probability distribution for a set of random variables. In this graph the nodes are the random variables, V1, V2, ..., Vn, and the edges signify probabilistic relationships. Bayesian Networks satisfy the Markov condition which states that each node is independent of its non-descendents given its parents,  (Peter Spirtes 2000), where the parents of a node are defined as those nodes with edges directed into the node, and the non-descendents are defined as nodes for which there is not a directed path from the original node. See Figure 1 for an illustration of two DAGs and the resulting probability distribution associated with each graph. Networks can be learned for a data set using two different approaches. One is the score-based approach in which a quantity such as the likelihood or the posterior probability of a model is maximized after searching over a set of potential networks. A second approach is the conditional independence approach in which the conditional independence relations found in the data are directly used to infer network structure (for instance in the PC algorithm, (Peter Spirtes 2000)). The advantages of BN learning algorithms are that they are powerful, they produce graphical models that are intuitive and interpretable, and several optimized algorithms and software programs are currently available. The disadvantages are that they are computationally intensive (NP-Hard), and existing algorithms are not suitable for large data sets without drastic modifications. An additional disadvantage is that the statistical interpretation and level of confidence in whole networks or network features can be difficult to obtain from existing algorithms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6313, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and path analysis in particular, has the same overall goal as BN, which is to learn the causal relationships among a set of random variables.

SEM has several advantages including a sound theoretical basis, several well-developed methods and software platforms (such as MPLUS, LISREL, AMOS, and others), accurate model evaluation statistics such as the chi-squared goodness of fit statistic, the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and many others, and parameter estimates and standard errors for all model parameters that have appropriate Type I errors under the specified model assumptions.
