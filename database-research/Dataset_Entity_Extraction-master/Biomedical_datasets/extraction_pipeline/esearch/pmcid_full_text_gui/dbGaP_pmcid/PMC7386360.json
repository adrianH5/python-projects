The transcriptomic features of that distinction are important for posttreatment surveillance and could also be useful for screening, initial diagnosis, and therapy. In this study, a comprehensive description of transcriptional features in normal-appearing healthy, normal-appearing tumor-adjacent, and tumor colorectal tissue was obtained in a joint analysis of pooled RNA-seq data sets combining a novel cohort with all human colorectal samples available in the Genomic Data Commons and Sequence Read Archive. Tumor-adjacent tissue was found to be more similar to healthy tissue than to cancer tissue in global transcriptional variation. However, tumor-adjacent tissue was found to harbor some transcriptional features of cancer that might be important modulators of malignancy. Furthermore, normal colon mucosa from healthy controls was used to identify novel TUM-specific gene expression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 25212, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study is the largest to date to investigate transcriptome-wide effects of CRC on adjacent, histologically normal mucosa using RNA-seq. The results are the first to demonstrate the consistent overexpression of 20 TUM-associated genes in histologically normal tissue sampled adjacent to tumors. Remarkably, genes contributing to established oncogenic pathways, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (e.g., AREG), early growth response (e.g., EGR1 and EGR2), and stem cell maintenance and differentiation (e.g., GREM1 and SOX9), were among the genes dysregulated in normal-appearing tissue. AREG encodes a ligand of EGFR, which activates signaling pathways that modulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis. EGFR is the target of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of metastatic CRC, and AREG expression might be a useful biomarker for therapy response in select populations. EGR1 and EGR2 are transcription factors involved in regulation of differentiation and apoptosis. EGR1 was shown to promote tumor cell growth in experimental models, and higher expression levels in tumor were associated with decreased disease-free survival in a CRC cohort. GREM1 encodes a BMP antagonist ectopically and highly expressed in hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome. In healthy tissue, GREM1 is expressed in subepithelial myofibroblasts, and secretion of its protein contributes to maintenance of the stem cell niche at the crypt base by permitting Wnt signaling. Overexpression of GREM1 in histologically normal tissue would be expected to potentiate malignant transformation. SOX9 is also involved in Wnt signaling and epithelial homeostasis and has been shown to affect goblet cell lineage and colonic morphology in mice. Dynamic monitoring of expression levels of these genes in unresected tissue could add prognostic information postoperatively.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27076, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study is also the first to identify novel genes associated with CRC that can be consistently masked by the field effect, including 23 genes that, to the authors' knowledge, have not previously been shown to vary in TUM samples compared with control samples.
