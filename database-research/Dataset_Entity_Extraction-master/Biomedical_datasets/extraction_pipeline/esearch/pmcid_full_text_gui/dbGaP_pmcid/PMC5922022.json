Cholesterol homeostasis is important for cell viability, and is dynamically regulated by a balance between synthesis, uptake, efflux and storage of cholesterol. For cellular cholesterol synthesis, the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) to mevalonate is the first rate limiting step, which is followed by over 20 flux controlling enzymatic reactions before cholesterol is synthesized as the final product. In prostate cancer cell-lines, elevated activity of the cholesterol synthesis pathway supports cancer growth and aggressiveness. This has led to the general view that increased cholesterol synthesis in prostate cancer cells contributes to cellular accumulation of cholesterol and prostate cancer growth. A diet high in fat and cholesterol increase the risk of prostate cancer, while statins directly targeting the cholesterol synthesis pathway are associated with improved clinical outcome (reviewed in). This is generally taken as support for the relevance of increased cholesterol synthesis in vivo. This notion was also in line with a recent study showing increased activity of the cholesterol synthesis enzyme squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) in lethal prostate cancer. Accordingly, one would expect that genes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway are upregulated when prostate cancer is compared to normal tissue. However, transcriptional changes in cholesterol genes are rarely highlighted when such comparisons are performed in large patient cohorts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4094, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We hypothesized that this is due to influence of confounding tissue components present in the samples. By confounding we refer to the variations in gene expression pattern between cancer and normal tissue samples which cannot be distinguished from variations caused by the presence of other tissue components in the samples. Gene expression analysis in human tissue is challenged by the highly heterogeneous tissue composition in each sample. The standard way to account for such heterogeneity is to incorporate tissue type percentages from histopathology during the analysis. Although confounding due to tissue composition is generally acknowledged, data from histopathology are missing in most publicly available patient cohorts, which may bias the molecular analyses. In prostate cancer, the presence of stroma tissue is shown to hide underlying molecular features in a differential analysis. Prostate tissues are usually histopathologically divided into benign epithelium, stroma tissue and prostate cancer. It is previously shown that the different number of tissue types present in prostate cancer (three tissue types) and in normal samples (two tissue types) leads to a systematic sampling bias of increased stroma content in the normal samples. Thus the presence of stroma tissue confounds differential analysis when cancer and normal samples are compared.Controlling for these biases will potentiate the discovery of molecular pathways and features otherwise hidden in the data.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5582, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To address this challenge we utilized two independent patient cohorts where the tissue composition of prostate cancer and normal samples has been thoroughly assessed by histopathology.

An overview of data from the seven patient cohorts is given in Table\u00a01. Cancer samples for all cohorts were from radical prostatectomy specimens, except for the Sboner cohort which was from a watchful waiting cohort. Normal samples were adjacent normal prostate tissue from prostatectomy specimens, except for four normal prostate samples in the Chen cohort which were autopsy samples from subjects without prostate cancer. Gene expression measurements from each patient cohort were downloaded and processed in the following way: Gene expression and metadata from Bertilsson were created by our group and processed as previously described. Data are available at Array Express with accession E-MTAB-1041. The best probe for each gene was selected as the one with the highest average rank by p-value in differential expression analysis (average over unstratified, balanced and unbalanced comparison, see below or main text for explanation). Gene expression and metadata from Chen were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession GSE8218. Probes were matched to gene names by the hg133a.db reference using limma in R. The best probe for each gene was selected as the one with the highest average rank by p-value in differential expression analysis. Gene expression and metadata from Taylor were downloaded from GEO accession GSE21034. Probes were matched to genes using the GPL10264 reference available at GEO. Probes with no matching gene were removed from further analysis. The best probe for each gene was selected as the one with the highest rank in a differential expression analysis between prostate cancer and normal samples. In the Taylor dataset, probes from the same gene generally had very similar ranks. Normalized and raw RNA-Seq read counts and gene names from TCGA where downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas [https://cancergenome.nih.gov/],. Normalized read counts were log2-adjusted before further analysis. For the Prensner cohort, RNA-Seq raw reads in fastq-format were downloaded with approval from dbGap (project #5870) with accession phs000443.v1.p1. Raw reads were mapped to the hg19 transcriptome using TopHat2, and featureCounts were used to assign the reads mapping to each gene. Normalization of gene counts were performed using the normalization formula from the voom program. Gene expression and metadata from Sboner were downloaded from GEO with accession GSE16560. Probes were matched to gene names using the GPL5474 reference available at GEO. Only four genes in the Sboner cohort had more than one probe. For these genes, the probes with the highest overall expression value were selected as the best probe. Quantile normalized exon expression data and metadata from the Erho cohort were downloaded from GEO with accession GSE46691. Exons identifiers were matched to gene names using the GPL5188 reference available at GEO. The total expression for each gene was calculated as the average expression over all exons for that gene. Differential expression of genes from Bertilsson, Chen and Taylor were identified using the limma package in R as described previously, while voom on raw RNA-Seq read counts was used for differential expression of genes from TCGA and Prensner. In total, 1943 samples (1713 prostate cancer and 230 normal) with 25,964 unique gene identifiers were considered over all seven datasets (the seven-study-cohort). Five of the cohorts (Bertilsson, Chen, Taylor, TCGA and Prensner, referred to as the five-study-cohort) contained both prostate cancer and normal samples (in total 1117 samples, 887 cancer and 230 normal). The seven-study-cohort contained 4804 shared genes, and the five-study-cohort contained 9527 shared genes over their respective cohorts. Quality assessment of each cohort was performed by evaluating the Pearson correlations between genes in previously validated gene sets related to ERG-fusion, an established feature of primary prostate cancer (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). Samples from the five-study-cohort consistently displayed a higher average ERG-fusion gene correlation in prostate cancer samples compared to normal samples. Cancer samples in the Erho cohort showed a similar average correlation compared to cancer samples in the five-study-cohort, while the Sboner cohort showed weaker average correlation.

The strategy can be applied to any cohort, as long as assessments of stroma content are available for both cancer and normal samples in the cohort. We will here use the Bertilsson cohort to briefly describe the procedure (Fig.\u00a01). The Bertilsson cohort consists of 116 prostate cancer and 40 normal samples, where each sample has been histopathologically assessed for its tissue composition (%) of stroma, cancer and benign epithelium. We separate both cancer and normal samples according to their stroma content where one group has low stroma content and the other has high stroma content, resulting in 4 groups altogether (58 cancer samples with highest stroma content, 58 cancer samples with lowest stroma content, 20 normal samples with highest stroma content and 20 normal samples with lowest stroma content). The balanced dataset is created by joining the 58 cancer samples with the highest percentages of stroma with the 20 normal samples with the lowest percentages of stroma, to create a dataset with balanced average amounts of stroma in cancer and control samples. In contrast, the unbalanced dataset is created by joining the 58 cancer samples with lowest content of stroma with the 20 normal samples with highest content of stroma, thus maximizing the difference of average stroma content between cancer and normal samples. The balanced dataset represents a comparison between prostate cancer and normal samples where the bias due to increased average stroma content in the normal samples has been minimized. Molecular differences in the balanced dataset are thus directly attributable to differences between cancer and normal tissue. The second dataset represent an unbalanced comparison where molecular differences mostly represent differences between prostate cancer and stroma tissue. Differentially expressed genes are then identified independently for the balanced and unbalanced datasets. The equal number of prostate cancer and normal samples in each dataset ensures a consistent statistical power, meaning that p-values are directly comparable for each gene between the balanced and unbalanced datasets.

The top ranked genes from this analysis were collected into gene-sets, which were used for GSEA-based assessment of stroma in samples from all seven cohorts. Robustness of stroma assessments was assured by assessing each sample independently by the two stroma gene-sets identified from the two histopathology cohorts. Although the two stroma gene-sets used were generated from independent cohorts using different microarray platforms, the identified stroma related genes showed 44% overlap for the top 2000 stroma associated genes, compared to 6% for random genes (Fig. 2a). A comparison with four previously published prostate stroma gene lists, showed an average overlap of 62%, compared to 8% for random genes (Fig. 2b).

In the two histopathology cohorts, the predicted stroma percentage from GSEA showed a mean deviation from histopathology between 10% and 11%, (r\u2009=\u20090.77 and r\u2009=\u20090.78), respectively (Fig. 2c). These measurements are in agreement with previously published comparisons between histopathology and gene based stroma predictions in prostate cancer. In both of the histopathology cohorts, the predicted percentages of stroma were highly correlated for the two gene-sets (r\u2009=\u20090.98) (Fig. 2c), and estimated GSEA scores in the additional five cohorts were also highly correlated (r between 0.95 and 0.99) (Additional file 1: Fig S3).

As further support for the validity of the stroma gene-sets, samples from several prostate cancer cell-lines included in the Taylor and Prensner cohorts, were consistently at the low end of stroma content when estimated by GSEA assessment. Overall, we conclude that the gene-sets give a stable, robust and reproducible representation of the stroma content in prostate cancer and normal tissue samples in each cohort.

Moreover, re-introduction of these cholesterol genes into the stroma gene-sets did not affect the stratification of samples into balanced and unbalanced datasets in any of the seven cohorts, showing that cholesterol-genes had no impact on the sample stratification. 3) The histopathology cohort from Chen was the only cohort that did not highlight cholesterol pathway genes as significant in the balanced dataset. Yet, all the balanced datasets in the other six cohorts still highlighted cholesterol genes as highly significant when the stroma gene-set derived from the Chen was used to balance the samples. Likewise, cholesterol pathway genes were not highlighted as significant in the balanced dataset from Chen when the stroma gene-set from Bertilsson was used to balance the samples in this cohort. This shows that both the Chen and the Bertilsson stroma gene-sets maintained the divergent balanced expression patterns for cholesterol genes when used in these two cohorts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44213, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also investigated two additional studies from the literature which could complement the findings in our study.

Although studies in prostate cancer cell-lines have demonstrated a role for cholesterol synthesis in tumor growth and aggressiveness, we have, after an extensive literature search, yet to see solid evidence for in vivo transcriptional upregulation of cholesterol synthesis in prostate cancer compared to normal tissue. Based on our results, we thus speculate how our observations may fit into the established mechanism of cholesterol metabolism for prostate cancer and for cells in general.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45798, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The regulation of cellular cholesterol levels is a highly complex and dynamic system, involving multiple feedback mechanisms (Fig. 4b), where downregulation of cellular cholesterol synthesis is not necessarily contradictory to other observations. Cholesterol homeostasis in the cell is controlled by cholesterol synthesis, transport and storage, but the true in vivo balance between these sources has yet to be elucidated. The most established enzymes related to cholesterol homeostasis are HMGCR and LDLR. HMGCR is the rate limiting enzyme for the cholesterol synthesis pathway in the cell, while LDLR controls the uptake of cholesterol from circulating Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). In addition, the cell can store excess cellular cholesterol in prostasomes or by cholesteryl esterification in lipid droplets. Increased availability of cholesterol from the environment may allow cells to shift their source of cholesterol from synthesis to uptake. Since cholesterol synthesis is energetically expensive, this shift can be beneficial for the cancer cell to save energy, and a recent study in prostate cancer cell-lines showed that environmental cholesterol can supplement cellular cholesterol levels as a response to cholesterol synthesis inhibition. Thus molecular precursors for cholesterol in the cell can be used in other pathways important for cancer growth. The shift may also prevent the anti-tumor activity of side products in the cholesterol pathway like oxysterols and isoprenoids, though the in vivo relevance for this mechanism is debated. Additionally, the shift can provide an explanation why statins have a beneficial effect on prostate cancer patients. Statins mostly target cholesterol synthesis in the liver leading to reduced circulating levels of cholesterol. This may limit the cholesterol available for cellular uptake, with activation of the cholesterol synthesis pathway and delayed cancer growth as a result. What contradicts this hypothesis is that not only HMGCR is downregulated in prostate cancer, but also LDLR. However, mechanisms alternative to LDLR for cholesterol and sterol uptake and efflux have been suggested, including changed activity of SLCO transporters (for example SLCO2B1 is strongly upregulated in the five-study-cohort, Fig. 4a) and modulation to cell-membrane structures like lipid rafts. Recently, cholesteryl esters in lipid droplets in prostate cancer PC3 cells were shown to originate from uptake rather than synthesis, supporting an increased attention to the role of cholesterol uptake in prostate cancer. Alternatively, statins may upregulate HMGCR in prostate cancer directly through feedback mechanisms, again with a possible cancer-preventive effect. Finally, increased HMGCR protein levels have recently been shown to correlate with improved clinical outcome in breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer. This may indicate that upregulation of the cholesterol pathway is a benign tumor characteristic, which is in line with the results presented here.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48807, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Expression differences in regulatory genes suggest a possible compensation in cellular cholesterol synthesis by decreased HMGCR degradation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48947, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "At the transcriptional level, HMGCR and LDLR mRNA are regulated, in particular by SREBF2, and partly by SREBF1 transcription factors, which also regulates most of the enzymes in the cholesterol pathway (Fig. 4b). SREBF is located on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum together with its cofactor SCAP. SCAP has a sterol-sensing domain, which activates SREBF-SCAP transport to the Golgi when sterol levels are low (Fig. 4b). In the Golgi, SREBF-SCAP is enzymatically cleaved twice, which creates the nuclear active form of SREBF1/2. In the balanced dataset, SREBF2 is downregulated while SCAP is upregulated (Fig. 4). However, any potential increase in SREBF transport to the Golgi by SCAP is again counterbalanced by downregulation of both cleaving enzymes MBTPS1 and MBTPS2. Thus the effect of SCAP upregulation on transcriptional activity is difficult to assess. HMGCR is also regulated at the translational level and at the level of degradation. We observe a strong downregulation of several key genes involved in HMGCR degradation, INSIG1, INSIG2 and AMFR (Fig. 4). Especially INSIG1 is one of the most highly ranked genes differentially expressed in the balanced dataset (average rank 9). This suggests that some HMGCR activity can be maintained through downregulation of INSIG1, and that targeting HMGCR degradation can be an interesting option for modulating cholesterol levels in prostate cancer. Studies in model systems will be necessary to assess the combined effect of decreased transcription on one hand and decreased degradation on the other hand. The mechanisms of translational regulation of HMGCR are not well known, but may involve feedback regulation from side-products of the cholesterol pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50670, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another pair of transcription factors implicated in negative regulation of cholesterol is the liver-X-receptors NR1H3 and NR1H2 (also called LXRA and LXRB) (Fig. 4b), which dimerize with RXRA and RXRB to exert their regulatory activity.

We observe an upregulation of NR1H3 targets, including the cholesterol efflux genes ABCA1 and ABCG1, the LDLR suppressor MYLIP and a very strong upregulation of APOE (ranked highest among all genes in the balanced dataset). APOE can be an important constituent of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) particles, where formation partly depends on the export by ABCA1 and ABCG1. However, here our results are in disagreement with other in vivo reports, which associates low levels of ABCA1 and low levels of circulating HDL with prostate cancer.

We were not able to obtain sufficient data to conclude on this issue. Nevertheless, we here discuss the limited data and information we were able to find. Information on statin use prior to surgery were available only for the Bertilsson cohort, were a total of 26 samples (18 cancer and 8 normal) were affected. Re-analysis of the Bertilsson cohort did not change the pattern of consistent downregulation of cholesterol pathway genes (Additional file 1: Figure S6). There is one report on the in vivo effect of statin on HMGCR levels in breast cancer. This report demonstrated that statins do not necessarily downregulate HMGCR, and that the effect of statin use was highly heterogeneous among patients.

Gleason grading of samples was provided for six of the seven cohorts, and did not show any bias with respect to balanced and unbalanced dataset (Additional file 1: Table S2). We thus conclude that Gleason grade is not a confounding factor in our analysis. Several studies have shown that normal stroma can transform into reactive stroma when located adjacent to cancer tissue. Thus the balanced analysis may also highlight genes resulting from differences between reactive and normal stroma. The strength of these differences will depend on the fraction of reactive stroma compared to normal stroma in the cancer samples. Histopathological differences between normal and reactive stroma were not assessed in the cohorts used in this study, and thus represents a limitation.
