Budding yeast origins are almost exclusively intergenic and consist of \u223c200 bp sequences that can be divided into the A and B domains (Figure 1). The A domain contains an essential ARS consensus sequence (ACS), variously assigned as 11\u201317 bp in length that is the binding site for the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC). ORC binding is required for the sequential recruitment of Cdc6, Cdt1 and MCM proteins during G1 to form a \u2018pre-replication complex\u2019 (pre-RC) that \u2018licenses\u2019 the origin for initiation in the subsequent S phase. A match to the ACS is essential but not sufficient for origin function, with only \u223c500 of the \u223c12 000 ACS matches in the yeast genome having replication origin function. Therefore additional surrounding sequences and/or chromatin states must be required to specify whether or not a particular ACS motif has replication origin function. The B region of an origin tends to be helically unstable (having a DUE or DNA unwinding element) and additionally contains a number of short sequence elements that contribute to origin activity, such as the B1, B2 and B3 elements of ARS1 (also known as ARSIV-463 or ARS416). The B1 element is thought to contribute to ORC recruitment; the B2 element resembles the ACS motif and is required for efficient loading of MCM proteins; the B3 element of ARS1 binds the transcription factor Abf1 and excludes nucleosomes from the core origin sequences.

Many areas of chromatin biology are impacted upon by DNA replication, and specifically by the location and nature of DNA replication origins. For example, it has been proposed the recombination hotspots co-localize with sites of DNA replication initiation, and the location of chromosome structural proteins (such as cohesion) may be influenced by the sites and activity of replication origins. Conversely, DNA replication and origin function are influenced by other chromosomal features, including transcription, chromatin structure and chromosome context, and these relationships can be viewed using OriDB.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 22118, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The structure of OriDB has been designed to allow for the incorporation of additional budding yeast datasets as they become available.
