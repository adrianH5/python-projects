All information has been integrated into a unique web resource, accessible via http://yeastgenome.org. The website also provides custom tools to allow useful searches and visualization of data. The experimentally defined functions of genes, mutant phenotypes, and sequence homologies archived in the SGD provide a platform for understanding many fields of biological research. The mission of SGD is to provide public access to all published experimental results on yeast to aid life science students, educators, and researchers.

What if a researcher is interested in only a small portion of what is known on a particular topic or gene, the relevant information being spread across many papers? What about bioinformaticists or computer scientists who wish to use computational analyses to explore results that are in the supplemental pages of many papers?

Information on protein-coding genes and non-protein-coding RNA genes, such as tRNA and rRNA genes, is typically what is available. The basic entry point is a gene name that leads directly to summary information about the locus. A keyword describing a function, phenotype, selective condition, or text from an abstract will also provide entry into SGD. Gene or chromosomal regions can be identified for exploration using a DNA or protein sequence with an integrated BLAST sequence search tool. Unique identifiers from many sources also provide valid entry points, such as protein and DNA sequence accession numbers, PubMed and NCBI identifiers, author names, and Gene Ontology (GO) function terms. The information provided by SGD has been gathered and is maintained by a group of scientists working as biocurators and software developers. This team is devoted to providing users with up-to-date information and connections to all the major research resources and tools that allow previously published data to be explored and the user\u2019s own results to be interpreted. The goal is to aid experimental design and the analysis of results as well as to facilitate education and further study of budding yeast.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3469, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "SGD MAINTAINS THE S. cerevisiae REFERENCE GENOME SEQUENCE", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3527, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The SGD is the keeper of S. cerevisiae nomenclature and reference genome sequence. It has been responsible for maintaining this important community documentation since 1996. The reference genome has been updated several times since its first release in 1996, typically for a single region only after specific rules were met; for example, both strands from a region in the S288C strain were sequenced to confirm that a change was necessary. As described by, a major update of the reference genome sequence occurred in 2010 to incorporate data generated by next-generation sequencing from a single colony. The sequence of this reference is deemed to be of such high quality that now only gross changes to the sequence will be considered. This is because any single colony is likely to have at least one nucleotide difference compared with its parent, excluding any sequence differences that arise because of technical errors. Thus, it is appropriate to assume that any minor differences observed are the result of allelic variation compared to the reference.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4584, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "ANNOTATIONS AND ONTOLOGIES IN THE SGD", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4622, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The SGD provides thousands of annotations for yeast genes and their products. Experimental results are captured as annotations using detailed precise vocabulary, typically in the form of an ontology, and include details of an experiment\u2019s evidence and methods and the appropriate literature citation. An ontology is a highly structured form of controlled vocabulary. Each entry in the ontology is commonly called a term. The name of the term is a short descriptive phrase, such as \u201ccarnitine dehydratase activity.\u201d However, each term also has a definition, similar to the definition of an English word found within a dictionary, which provides the complete usage and detailed explanation of the word/term. It is critical to consult the term\u2019s definition because the distinction between terms can be subtle. One important difference between the definition of an ontology term and that of an English word is that the term has only one meaning; however, there can be synonyms. The creation of ontology terms and their definitions often involves debate but the result has been a descriptive language. The use of ontologies has been successful in unifying communication between scientific communities and in providing a standard dictionary for topics such as molecular functions, biological processes, mutant phenotypes, chemical properties, and structures. In addition to terms and definitions, ontologies require a relationship between terms to define the type of connection (relationship). In an ontology, a term can have more than one parent term, the term above it in the ontology, as well as more than one child, terms below it in the ontology. GO is a system used to describe gene function and is used extensively in SGD annotations. Further details on the GO project are available from several sources. GO annotations are often used to illustrate the structure of an ontology, but many other ontologies are also used to construct annotations in SGD, as is the case in all modern biological databases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6634, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "SGD USER INTERFACE", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6653, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The main entry point into SGD is the home page, www.yeastgenome.org.

For example, the drop-down menus, \u201cAnalyze\u201d for computational tools or \u201cFunction\u201d for collections of experimental results such as microarray expression or mutant phenotype data, can be selected. Also at the upper right corner of every page is located the \u201cSearch\u201d box. Here text can be entered to search the contents of the database. For example, if the word \u201cactin\u201d is slowly typed into the search box a list appears and changes with the addition of each letter. Entry of \u201cactin\u201d should bring down many phrases that contain \u201cactin.\u201d The results of a search include all the entries for all types of information found within SGD that matches the input string. Selecting a search result takes the user to the relevant page; for example, selecting the \u201cactin\u201d search result, ACT1, brings up the Locus Overview page, which presents the collected information on ACT1 and its product. The locus overview page for another gene, SNF1 (AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase), is illustrated in Figure 1. All of the information provided by SGD via its web pages or search tools can be downloaded from its dedicated file retrieval site by selecting the \u201cDownload\u201d button at the top of every SGD page.
