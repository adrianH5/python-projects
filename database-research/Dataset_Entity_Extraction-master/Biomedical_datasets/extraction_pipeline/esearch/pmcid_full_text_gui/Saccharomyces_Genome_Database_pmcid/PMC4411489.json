Data types provided by ASAP include annotations, sequences, expression, experiments, and information on mutant strains. ASAP is an authority-controlled database where guests can view the published genomic data on genomes and experiments and the full data of K-12 MG1655.

To achieve user flexibility and convenience, these databases also provide several general and dedicated toolsets. Most of the aforementioned databases are open-source and the users can freely download data directly from the resources webpage or FTP site. Furthermore, the databases above continuously update, aiming to become authority resources for model organism study. Although many advantages are listed here, there are shortcomings as well. For instance, different data formats or interface standards are applied in establishing these databases, which bring some limitations, for example data integration, when the users want to access a kind of the data from different databases. We hope that all these databases will be taken care of by well-organized communities and perform the normative data standardization to enhance data sharing and exchange, while also pushing the
