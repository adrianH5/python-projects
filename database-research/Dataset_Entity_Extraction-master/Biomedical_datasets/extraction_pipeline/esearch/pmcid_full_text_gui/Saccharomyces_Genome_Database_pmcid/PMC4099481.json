This action is intrinsically connected to cellular ion homeostasis (through the action of anti-porters utilizing the generated membrane potential via a proton electrochemical gradient), as well as proteolytic activation (digestion of autophagasomes during autophagy or vacuolar proteolysis induced by starvation), endocytosis, and vacuole fusion. Furthermore, intracellular pH and Ca2+ ion concentrations as well as direct interaction of the V-ATPase complex with the actin cytoskeleton are implicated in bud formation and polarized growth during cell cycle. In relation to the vacuole\u2019s lytic function, VAM3 (YOR106W) encoding the syntaxin-like protein Vam3p (a vacuolar t-SNARE) is responsible for the correct trafficking and processing of proteinases A, B and carboxypeptidase Y and maturation of alkaline phosphatase. The relevance of Vam3p to fermentation outcome and tolerance of stress (hyperosmolarity, heat, ethanol and oxidation) is highlighted by the protracted fermentation of the \u0394vam3 mutant (Additional file 1) and growth sensitivity towards these stress parameters (Additional file 2).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44190, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The importance of the assembly and function of the V-ATPase complex during fermentation, was highlighted by the number of genes identified (Additional files 4 and Table\u00a03). These encode either the subunits of the V1 peripheral membrane and V0 integral membrane domains, or the assembly factors including the RAVE complex, which are required for the reversible assembly and disassembly into the free V1 and V0 domains, in response to glucose. The assembly of V-ATPase is thought to prevent cytosolic acidification when metabolism is active, as protons are sequestered in the vacuolar lumen by the V-ATPase. This is particularly relevant in high sugar fermentation, when the plasma membrane bound pump Pma1p, the principal regulator of cytosolic pH, is transiently inhibited. As glucose becomes limited, the disassembly of some V-ATPase complexes is thought to conserve ATP, as ATP hydrolysis is absent in the isolated V1 domain. The role of vacuolar ATPase in fermentation is supported by previous research showing deletion of structural genes resulting in growth sensitivity to ethanol and hyperosmolarity due to high concentrations of glucose (300 g L\u22121,). How these differences relate to the pH-dependent growth of vma (vacuolar membrane ATPase) deletants is unclear. Whilst vma deletants, through the loss of V-ATPase activity, exhibit growth sensitivity at high pH (>pH 7) or high extracellular calcium and zinc, and reportedly are unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, they are able to grow under acidic conditions (pH 5.5) albeit slower than the wild type. In this study, the mutants were able to grow in CDGJM_200 (pH 3.5) after an extended lag period yet only reached 60-80% of the parent biomass (Figure\u00a05). The ability of these cells to grow even in the presence of initially high sugar and acid and later, increasing ethanol, is strong evidence that vacuolar acidification by this enzyme complex is not the only mechanism involved. Yeast possess additional, and yet unidentified independent mechanisms to acidify the endosomal compartments including the vacuole. We have preliminary microscopy data using 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate which supports this notion. Specifically, early in fermentation (24 h) vacuolar acidification, as anticipated, was reduced in a \u0394vma1 mutant compared to the parent BY4743. However, after 72 h and 125 h, by which time fermentation was progressing well, vacuolar acidification was restored in the mutant (data not shown). Recently, vacuolar acidification, particularly the proton dependent storage of neutral amino acids rather than protein degradation in the vacuole, has also been linked to chronological aging. The authors proposed that age-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is a result of decreased vacuolar acidification in aging mother cells, and the regeneration of vacuolar acidification in budding daughter cells, is coincidental with rejuvenation of lifespan. This network between the vacuole and mitochondria, thought to be mediated by nutrient-sensing pathways such as PKA, Sch9 and TOR, is important given that fermentation occurs over an extended time-frame, primarily by stationary phase cells which are progressively aging.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47392, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several proposed mechanisms to maintain vacuolar pH independent of V-ATPase include passive diffusion and dissociation of weak acids, endocytic internalisation of acid equivalents or Pma1p itself, and ammonium ions acting as protonophores after uptake. These mechanisms would enable growth under acidic conditions through pH equilibration across the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane, maintaining the intracellular pH gradient between the cytosol and vacuole, relative to the outside. This process is vital to cell adaption to fermentation associated stresses, and allowing for complete sugar catabolism albeit at a slower rate. Whilst some of these alternative mechanisms may play a role normally in pH regulation, V-ATPase is the principal proton pump proposed to protect yeast from heat stress, alcohol stress, osmotic stress, and acid stress associated with fermentation, as well as against stresses of air-drying.

Both pathways are crucial for successful sugar fermentation, with not only vma mutants being identified but also the genes for Hog1p and its activator, Pbs2p.
