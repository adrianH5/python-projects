In addition to capturing and summarizing experimental results, the structured nature of GO annotations allows for functional comparison across organisms as well as propagation of functional predictions between related gene products. Due to their relevance to many areas of research, ensuring the accuracy and quality of these annotations is a priority at SGD. GO annotations are assigned either manually, by biocurators extracting experimental evidence from the scientific literature, or through automated methods that leverage computational algorithms to predict functional information. Here, we discuss the relationship between literature-based and computationally predicted GO annotations in SGD and extend a strategy whereby comparison of these two types of annotation identifies genes whose annotations need review. Our method, CvManGO (Computational versus Manual GO annotations), pairs literature-based GO annotations with computational GO predictions and evaluates the relationship of the two terms within GO, looking for instances of discrepancy. We found that this method will identify genes that require annotation updates, taking an important step towards finding ways to prioritize literature review. Additionally, we explored factors that may influence the effectiveness of CvManGO in identifying relevant gene targets to find in particular those genes that are missing literature-supported annotations, but our survey found that there are no immediately identifiable criteria by which one could enrich for these under-annotated genes.

These predictions can complement existing manual annotations, and provide clues about the functions of uncharacterized proteins. Among the computationally predicted annotations are those provided by the GOA project at UniProtKB, including InterPro to GO, which is based on protein sequence signatures; and SwissProt Keywords (SPKW) to GO (http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/spkw2go). SGD also includes annotations from methods presented in publications, which, at the time of this analysis, included two sophisticated algorithms that integrate multiple data sets to automatically assign annotations: bioPIXIE/MEFIT and YeastFunc. BioPIXIE/MEFIT considers relationships between genes inferred from different types of high-throughput data sets, such as protein localization, interactions and genomic expression data, to generate predicted GO annotations in Biological Process. The YeastFunc method integrates large-scale data sets with sequence-based inferences to make predictions in all three GO aspects (Molecular Function, Biological Process, Cellular Component). The GO annotations in SGD that are assigned via all of these computational methods carry either the IEA (Inferred from Electronic Annotation) or RCA (Reviewed Computational Analysis) evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). SGD works with authors of publications to determine the most appropriate cut-off in order to provide the best representation of the predictive method while maintaining a high level of confidence in the computational annotation.

The challenge is to identify these genes in an efficient manner. Because manual curation requires significant effort and our resources are limited, we need to define a pipeline that will support this type of prioritization of our curatorial tasks. To begin addressing this issue, we previously explored whether computational predictions can be used as an indicator for identifying genes with \u2018unknown\u2019 annotations that need review. \u2018Unknown\u2019 annotations are created by manually assigning the root term of a GO aspect, which are the broadest terms that exist: \u2018molecular_function\u2019 (GO:0003674), \u2018biological_process\u2019 (GO:0008150), and \u2018cellular_component\u2019 (GO:0005575). These annotations indicate that at the time of curatorial review no evidence is present in the literature that would allow a more specific annotation to be made for the gene product. We presented a method by which we paired a manual literature-based annotation with a computationally predicted annotation and looked for correspondence between the two, a method that in this article we will refer to as \u2018Computational vs Manual GO annotations\u2019 (CvManGO). In the previous study, we found that when an InterPro prediction existed for a gene that was manually annotated to \u2018unknown\u2019, we were often able to find evidence in the literature to assign a biological function to that gene. Here we extend this analysis by considering additional prediction methods.

We attempted to leverage the computational predictions as a curation aid to help us improve our set of manual annotations. The importance of high-quality GO annotations, particularly for a model eukaryote such as yeast, in combination with large quantities of published data and finite resources, make it imperative to develop efficient ways of identifying and prioritizing annotations for review and updating. By using both literature-based and computationally predicted annotations and leveraging the strengths of each against the other, we hope to improve the efficiency of our curation efforts in order to provide scientists with the most up-to-date, complete, and accurate biological information.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47317, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary data", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47336, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Supplementary data are available at Database Online.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47389, "infons": {"section_type": "ACK_FUND", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Funding", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 47397, "infons": {"section_type": "ACK_FUND", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": ", : Saccharomyces Genome Database project [] and the  [].
