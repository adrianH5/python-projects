By profiling the human phosphoproteome, we estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of phosphosites and predict a more realistic count of true identifications. We rank sites into phosphorylation likelihood sets and analyze them in terms of conservation across 100 species, sequence properties, and functional annotations. We demonstrate significant differences between the sets and develop a method for independent phosphosite FDR estimation.

The dominance of MS approaches has led to the development of multiple strategies to both understand and help mitigate the high levels of phosphopeptide false discovery rate (FDR), particularly in sets of mapped peptide spectral matches (PSMs) that result from LC-MS/MS and sequence database analysis.\u2212 The goal of such approaches is to separate true identifications from false ones. Even without considering noncanonical phosphorylation (which is likely to be absent in typical phosphoproteomics pipelines due to its acid-labile nature), many confidently identified phosphopeptides possess multiple Ser, Thr, or Tyr residues that could be differentially modified in a given proteolytically generated peptide. Phosphosite occupancy is variable on any given protein under different biological conditions such that analysis of a peptide containing, for example, two Ser residues that have the potential to be phosphorylated with different dynamics could present evidence for either only one or both being modified, depending on the sample studied. Many phosphorylation events are also substoichiometric, possibly falling below the limit of detection of certain analyses. As such, careful data handling and statistical processes should be applied, either within the search engine used for peptide mapping or in a downstream software application to calculate additional statistics, such as a local false localization rate (FLR) or conversely the probability that a given site within a peptide is correct or incorrect. Software/algorithms include phosphoRS, Ascore, Andromeda\u2019s PTM Score, and recently released PTMProphet. We have previously benchmarked the performance of some instrumental parameters and software pipelines for phosphoproteomics, demonstrating that there is considerable variability in how such scores map to robust statistics, such as local or global FLR, depending on the instrument fragmentation mode and resolution.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4645, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Following confident identification of phosphopeptides and localization of given sites, data tend to be compiled from within a single study or across multiple studies (meta-analysis) to determine the extent of evidence for a given site from multiple PSMs. In general, where there are independent observations of PSMs supporting a phosphosite, it can be reasonably assumed that the evidence for a site to be real increases, although to our knowledge, there are no current statistical models to calculate this phenomenon accurately. Multiple PSMs can be observed per identified phosphosite as a result of either different peptide sequences containing that site, or the same peptide sequence being detected several times. There are some caveats to this logic though, as it is possible for the same PSM to be wrongly assigned to a phosphopeptide multiple times. This can occur if the correct interpretation for the spectrum had a very similar peptide sequence and identical mass to the wrongly assigned phosphopeptide. Although LC-MS/MS and computational analysis is generally recognized as very effective and reliable for phosphosite detection, from each study, it is likely that there is some element of remaining false discovery of peptides and sites wrongly localized, depending on the applied statistical thresholds. This is particularly problematic for studies that set relatively weak thresholds for phosphosite localization (e.g., equating to site probability >0.75) to maximize sensitivity\u2014more true positives may be identified, but at the expense of very large numbers of false positives passing the threshold. A multicenter benchmarking study highlighted some of the challenges in practice, showing considerable variability in the number of true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative sites reported across different laboratories, with particular issues arising when a peptide carried multiple phosphate groups. Methods and guidelines for FLR are still evolving and not consistently applied in phosphoproteome studies, and so it is likely that most published studies contain considerable numbers of falsely localized phosphosites.\u2212 This can lead to overestimation of the total number of known true human phosphosites if database providers do not control for FDR across multiple datasets.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6949, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One such database is PhosphoSitePlus (PSP) which represents a comprehensive, manually curated, and well-cited resource containing experimentally defined PTMs primarily focusing on phosphorylation. As of March 2020, PSP encompassed phosphosite evidence across 17\u202f830 human protein sequences, which are defined as canonical in UniProt (representing the most prevalent protein product per gene, for example). The evidence for phosphorylation comes from manually curated reviews of literature primarily describing tandem MS studies and also low-throughput experiments, or from in-house MS studies. Interestingly, the majority of phosphosites in PSP only have a single piece of evidence associated with their identification (i.e., there is only one study identifying the phosphosite). As mentioned in the PSP documentation itself, researchers should be cautious when accepting such sites as true positives. It is possible that many users of PSP are not aware of the need for caution when reviewing or reusing data, and we are not familiar with any previous effort to assess phosphosite FDR within PSP. A second curated proteomics resource is PeptideAtlas (PA) which is a repository of tandem MS datasets that have been processed through Trans-Proteomic Pipeline to ensure high and consistent quality of phosphopeptide identifications. The latest PA builds incorporate the use of the PTMProphet algorithm for phosphosite localization where each potential phosphosite within an observed PSM is assigned a probability score between 0 and 1 of being phosphorylated. As with PSP, researchers should also be careful when accepting sites in PA with only a single piece of identification evidence (i.e., a single associated PSM) as positively identified phosphosites. Instead, phosphosites that not only have multiple PSM observations in PA but also have high phosphorylation probability scores assigned within the majority of those PSMs are most likely to be true-positive identifications. In addition to PSP and PA, other databases containing data on human phosphosites include UniProt, which collates mostly manually curated phosphosites from the literature but is planned to start incorporating high-throughput derived data in later releases; dbPTM, a server importing data from other resources, but currently unavailable as of July 2021; and PhosphoDB containing results from a set of studies on phosphopeptides derived from multiple proteases.

Each sequence in the human proteome was used as a query in a BLASTp search (BLAST+ 2.10.0 version) against all 100 eukaryotic proteomes. The BLAST output was processed to extract a top matching significant orthologue (E-value of \u22640.00001) from each species for each human target. Human targets were then aligned with their matched orthologues using the MUSCLE algorithm (version 3.8.31) with default settings if all sequences to be aligned were <2000 amino acids long. If any sequences to be aligned (either the human sequence or any of the orthologue sequences) were \u22652000 amino acids long, two iterations of the algorithm were run using settings for large alignments (-maxiters 2 option). From the alignments, percentage conservation scores were calculated for every Ser, Thr, and Tyr site within each human target out of 100 (all eukaryotic proteomes) and out of the number of aligned orthologues. Conservation percentages were calculated considering any Ser/Thr substitutions in orthologues, whereby an orthologue was included in the count if, for example, a Thr in its sequence was aligned with a Ser in the target human sequence and vice versa.

Those sets were then cross-referenced with data in PSP to determine whether PSP contained any sites ranked as nonphosphosites in PA.

This strongly indicated the presence of potential false positives in PSP and/or false negatives in PA. For example, Ser42 in protein P17066 (HSPA6) and Ser59 in Q8N488 (RYBP) had 8 and 6 phosphosite identification references in PSP, respectively (mostly from in-house MS studies), but had no positive identification evidence in PA or any mention in UniProt (Table S5). On the other hand, Ser4 in P15927 (RPA2) had 33 phosphosite identification references in PSP and was also mentioned in UniProt\u2019s annotations, but has never been positively localized in any of its 127 associated PSMs in PA (Table S5). To eliminate potential false assignments when considering evidence in both PSP and PA, a site was only categorized as a nonphosphosite if it had no evidence in PSP in addition to having \u201cnegative\u201d phosphorylation evidence in PA (Table 1). As a result, we established final negative control sets containing 13\u202f892 Ser, 8462 Thr, and 2184 Tyr sites.

In our first analysis, we explored the mean conservation of phosphosites and nonphosphosites per protein (at least three of each present per protein) and performed a correlation analysis across all proteins (Figure 2). We fitted linear regression models through the origin, under the theory that proteins unique to humans would have zero conservation for both phosphosites and nonphosphosites. We found great variation between the conservation of both site types, ranging from near zero to 100%, which was mostly dependent on the overall conservation of the protein sequence. However, based on the generated linear regression models, we concluded that on average, Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphosites (\u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cMedium\u201d in PSP and/or PA) were around 4.6, 5.4, and 2.0%, respectively, more conserved across all 100 eukaryotes than corresponding likely nonphosphosites (sites in \u201cNot phosphorylated\u201d and \u201cOther\u201d sets) within analyzed proteins when allowing Ser/Thr substitutions toward the conservation score (Figure 2). Similar results were obtained when assessing phosphosite conservation only across found orthologues for each protein (Figure S1). The results (Figures 2 and S1) provide additional evidence that phosphosites are generally more conserved than nonphosphosites. The difference in conservation is thus subtle and variable, but statistically robust.

In fact, previous reports estimated that as many as 65% of known phosphosites may be nonfunctional as individual sites (although may have a more general structural role) due to limited kinase specificity and therefore have similar evolution rates compared to nonphosphosites which would explain the observed trends. It is also possible that some proteins were formed by recent gene fusion events leading to regions containing phosphorylation sites only found in a few closer related orthologues (low conservation), with other protein domains being more highly conserved.

As before, the sets were analyzed in terms of adjacent amino acids around target phosphosites (Figure S3A\u2013F). Due to potential phosphosite differences and biases associated with different discovery methods (motif frequency, for example), we suggest that our method should only be used to analyze sites from high-throughput studies because it was built primarily using sites of similar evidence type. This is further evident from the conservation analysis of UniProt sites (Figure S3H,I), which revealed different conservation patterns between the set of sites identified by large-scale studies and the other UniProt sets. As a result, we were able to estimate FDR for a set of UniProt sites with evidence from large-scale proteomics studies (Figure S3G). In that set, we estimated average pSer FDR = 7% (CI \u00b1 8%); pThr FDR = 22% (CI \u00b1 14%) and pTyr FDR = 6% (CI \u00b1 7%) (Figure S3G), suggesting that there is a much higher proportion of true-positive phosphosites in UniProt compared to PSP or PA datasets.

For example, if a study reported 1200 phosphosites at 5% FDR, of which 1000 are pSer and 200 are pThr, the false positives (\u223c60) would assort approximately equally across pSer (\u223c30 out of 1000 i.e., 3% FDR on pSer) and pThr (\u223c30 out of 200 i.e., 15% on pThr), meaning that in the vast majority of studies (which do not correct for this issue) the general pThr FDR will be significantly higher than for pSer. For pTyr, the majority of sites comes from separate studies that specifically enrich for pTyr via antibodies, which likely accounts for the pTyr FDR being similar to the pSer FDR.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46666, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Functional Enrichment Analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46697, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our analysis, we categorized all 20\u202f271 proteins in the filtered human reference proteome (Table S5) according to what their highest-ranked Ser, Thr, and Tyr site was based on phosphorylation likelihood sets in Table 1.

Interestingly, proteins with sites from \u201cLow in PSP and/or PA\u201d set as their highest-ranked site and proteins which did not have any evidence phosphorylation evidence (\u201cNo evidence in PSP or PA\u201d set) were also enriched for numerous functional categories suggesting that they too share some functional properties (Figure S4). Proteins containing sites from the \u201cNot phosphorylated\u201d set as their highest-ranked Ser/Thr/Tyr site were enriched for one significant functional group in the case of Tyr dataset and no functional groups in the case of Ser/Thr datasets, which was likely due to small protein sample size in those sets.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48045, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To investigate this further, we compared the top 10 enriched functional groups between the protein sets and found that proteins containing Ser, Thr, and Tyr sites with the most phosphorylation evidence (\u201cHigh in PSP and PA\u201d set) were significantly enriched for categories and terms associated with phosphorylation such as \u201cPhosphoprotein\u201d, \u201cTranscription\u201d, \u201cNucleus\u201d, and \u201cAlternative splicing\u201d (Figure 5), suggesting that those proteins were true phosphoproteins. There is a risk of generating circular evidence here, as the enriched term \u201cPhosphoprotein\u201d is a UniProt keyword, and will have been annotated based on literature evidence, potentially shared with PSP. UniProt does not routinely load phosphorylation evidence from high-throughput datasets, and so classifications of phosphoproteins are generally independent of evidence used in PA. Other enriched keywords have also likely been determined based on independent evidence, and thus we believe are unbiased observations of our sets. Overall, 92.3, 93.9, and 88.2% of proteins containing Ser, Thr, and Tyr sites of the highest phosphorylation likelihood, respectively, were enriched for the term \u201cPhosphoprotein\u201d, which, as per description in UniProt, is a term assigned to a \u201cprotein which is post-translationally modified by the attachment of either a single phosphate group, or of a complex molecule, such as 5\u2032-phospho-DNA, through a phosphate group\u201d. Furthermore, those proteins were enriched for \u201cAcetylation\u201d (Figure 5) which in some cases might indicate phosphorylation since crosstalk between acetylation and phosphorylation has been frequently reported, alongside other modifications such as O-glycosylation. Another enriched function is \u201cAlternative splicing\u201d (Figure 5) which is known to be controlled by reversible phosphorylation, further indicating that those proteins likely contain functional phosphosites. However, it is possible that this enrichment could correlate with the depth of analysis of the mentioned proteins rather than their phosphorylation likelihood since extensively studied gene products (and abundant proteins with more easily detectable phosphosites) are likely to have better quality data associated with isoform identification and be consequently linked to \u201cAlternative splicing\u201d.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50371, "infons": {"file": "pr2c00131_0006.jpg", "id": "fig5", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Top 10\nfunctional categories for which protein sets containing\nvarious highest-ranked (A) Ser, (B) Thr, and (C) Tyr sites based on\nthe amount of available phosphorylation evidence (\u201cHigh in PSP and PA\u201d, \u201cLow in PSP and/or\nPA\u201d, \u201cNo evidence in PSP or PA\u201d) were significantly enriched in DAVID (Benjamini\u2013Hochberg\ncorrected p value <0.05).

We found that significantly more (Fisher\u2019s test p value <0.05) Ser, Thr, and Tyr sites with the strongest phosphorylation evidence (\u201cHigh in PSP and PA\u201d set) were localized within coiled coils compared to sites in the \u201cNot phosphorylated\u201d set (Figure 7). This might readily be explained by coiled coils being frequently found in transcription factors, the activity or subcellular location of which is often dependent on phosphorylation.\u2212 Therefore, the results in Figure 7 further indicated that there were more potential true Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphosites in \u201cHigh in PSP and PA\u201d set than in other sets.

Having analyzed the sites and the proteins that contain them in terms of conservation, proximal site patterns, functional enrichment, and structural properties, we established that Ser, Thr, and Tyr sites with weak phosphosite identification evidence, particularly sites with a single piece of supporting evidence, were likely to be false-positive identifications. This finding was further confirmed by FDR estimations across the established phosphorylation likelihood sets which revealed phosphosite FDR of 84, 98, and 82% in sets of Ser, Thr, and Tyr sites, respectively, where only one piece of identification evidence was present. Since there is a considerable presence of such sites in PSP and PA datasets, our results implied high FDR in both those datasets, although PSP was predicted to have a generally higher proportion of false-positive phosphosites compared to PA. This is potentially a cause for concern since many potential false positives are presented to scientists as true phosphosites, without a clear explanation of the likelihood of such claims. Nevertheless, using our FDR estimates we predicted that there are around 62\u202f000 Ser, 8000 Thr, and 12\u202f000 Tyr true-positive phosphosites in the human proteome that are supported by evidence in PSP and/or PA. These estimated counts are lower than other published estimates particularly for Ser/Thr sites, presumably due to the previous inclusion of false positives and subsequent overestimation of the number of true phosphosites. We conclude that researchers must be aware of the potential for false-positive sites in both public and self-generated databases and should always evaluate the evidence behind the phosphosites used in their research. As a general rule, phosphorylation sites with <5 independent observations should be treated with caution, and those with only one observation in a database are likely to be false positives. In a recent phosphoproteomics study from our group, we demonstrated the utility of the classification presented here, by matching the sites identified by LC-MS/MS to their evidence categories from PSP and PA. For new phosphoproteomics studies, it will be common for some ambiguity to remain regarding phosphosite localization, and many sites will be observed that would not pass a 1 or 5% false localization rate cutoff from a single dataset, but for which there may be some supporting evidence. By evaluating new datasets in combination with all of the evidence collated from a large number of previous studies, greater confidence can be assigned to \u201cborderline\u201d significant phosphosites that may indeed be correct, or conversely, sites with weak evidence that have never been reported can be rejected.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 58366, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here, we have provided a methodological framework for estimating global FDR in large-scale phosphorylation datasets, which does not rely on native scores from search engines or site localization software.
