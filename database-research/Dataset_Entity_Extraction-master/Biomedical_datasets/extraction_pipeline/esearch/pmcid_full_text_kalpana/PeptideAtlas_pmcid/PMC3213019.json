Under increasing threat from disease and chemical residues in the environment, research efforts on this beneficial insect have escalated in the past five years. After completion of the honey bee genome sequence in 2006, the next step is to understand the proteome. Implicit in this goal is that the expressed proteome of the bee must first be defined: bioinformatic analyses place the number of honey bee genes near 10,000, (summarized in) but only a handful of these have been observed experimentally at the protein level. Since most gene prediction algorithms require a training set of genes with well-established translation start/stop sites and intron-exon boundaries, the lack of even a hundred bee genes with real experimental evidence, let alone annotated to this level of quality, hinders prediction efforts. Homology-based methods using Drosophila and other organisms with well-annotated gene lists have helped to find core bee genes, yet the relatively large evolutionary distance between Drosophila and Apis (~300 million years) poses limitations on this approach. For example, the eusociality of bees implies the expression of genes that flies, being solitary insects, would not have. mRNA sequences, such as from EST libraries, can help to map transcribed genes but experimentally verified proteins are still the ultimate affirmation of gene expression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3085, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The emerging field of proteogenomics applies the power of mass spectrometry proteomics to improve the genomic understanding for a species.

The peak lists were initially searched against the NCBI A. mellifera protein database (plus human contaminants and digestion enzymes) using a Mascot score cutoff of 27, essentially as described. Spectra that did not match any peptides from this search were re-searched against a six-frame translation of the honey bee genome.

For a genomic six-frame translation library this cut-off is not very stringent but this was used simply as an initial filtering step. ORFs that were hit by at least two unique peptides were examined further to see if they could be missed exons of previously annotated genes or if they occurred far from any known genes and thus might be novel genes.

GO is a controlled vocabulary describing the molecular function, biological process and cellular component for gene products, where the same terms are used across all species. In order to provide an ontological classification scheme for bee proteins as an additional resource to the community, BLAST2GO was used to assign tentative annotations to honey bee proteins based on the closest sequence homolog for which GO assignments are available. A total of 9009 sequences can be matched to at least one GO term, or about 37% of the sequences in the Honey Bee PeptideAtlas. The majority remains unmatched, primarily because the input sequences include ones from earlier annotations of the genome which have been eliminated in later versions; in searching our MS data against them we saw that some were falsely excluded since they match peptide spectra, however, we inevitably include protein sequences that are not actually translated. Another reason would be the lack of well-annotated insect proteins (e.g., relative to human and mouse) for bee proteins to match against.

On the other hand, ribosomal and other ribonucleoproteins seem to be proportionally more abundant in bees.

Many apparently high quality spectra are not matched for a number of reasons, the most common of which is thought to be the omission of some post-translational modifications in the database search parameters. However, incomplete gene annotation is another likely cause of unassigned spectra: if the gene has not been identified or has been mis-annotated then the relevant peptide that could match to the spectra in question might not be present in the database. Even Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes are not completely annotated but few unannotated proteins can be found, even with deep proteome coverage; for organisms with relatively short histories in genomic research, such as honey bees, the gene annotation is still quite fluid. Furthermore, sometimes predicted genes or experimentally observed ones (e.g., by expressed sequence tags) are not translated in silico and therefore not placed into publically accessible protein databases. Given that MS data is not searched by BLAST against a nucleic acid database but by protein database only, this likely represents a significant source of \"missing\" proteins - an oversight that we hope to address with this proteogenomics effort. By searching a six-frame translation of the entire bee genome we have previously been able to identify several apparently real proteins expressed from unannotated genes (i.e., ones which are not in protein databases) so here we undertook a more systematic and larger-scale re-annotation of bee proteins using MS/MS data (Figure 6). Spectra matching peptides in the existing protein database (27,256 unique sequences, we call these \"pre-existing peptides\") were separated from the unmatched spectra, using a Perl script.
