A recent review presents the roles of several well-established MS proteomics repositories and highlights the need for further diversity of data. However, in these repositories, organisms that are not commonly regarded as classical model organisms are widely underrepresented, if represented at all. Studies of farm animal proteomes have recently gained much interest, particularly regarding cattle and pig. This is mainly because proteomics offers unmatched opportunities to characterize biological traits of farm animals, and is thereby a key to improve industrial production of meat and milk. This is of immediate relevance for economic gain as well as for alleviating problems related to animal welfare and product quality within agriculture and food industries. While individual studies provide valuable new insights into the proteomic mechanisms (e.g., of particular diseases), farm animal data repositories are by far lagging behind. For example, as of November 2011 the PRIDE database (www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) contained more than 3320 human proteome datasets, but only 34 bovine experiments, mainly originating from studies of reproduction biology characterizing sperm and oocyte proteomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2413, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Within the past decade, the PeptideAtlas project (www.peptideatlas.org) has provided a large scale assembly of LC-MS/MS-based shotgun proteome data, and covers the proteomes of many species, most importantly those of human, including specialized builds for specific tissues and body fluids, and common model organisms like yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Drosophila melanogaster. The PeptideAtlas has been useful in characterizing the biological systems of these organisms as well as in setting foundations for other species such as the honeybee. The PeptideAtlas has become the tool of choice for selecting proteotypic peptides, which can be used to build methods for targeted proteomics and Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM).

For the purpose of building the PeptideAtlas we collected a set of representative samples from various in-house cattle proteome projects, aiming to provide good protein and peptide coverage on inflammatory and host response proteins. In addition to milk samples, we included colostrum, the bovine mammary epithelial cell line MAC-T used for in vitro studies of mammary epithelial host response, udder tissues, a subcellular mitochondria fraction and hoof tissues (see Table 1).

In some of the samples, peptides were labeled with the iTRAQ\u2122 Reagent Multi-Plex Kit according to manufacturer's manual (ABSciex, Foster City, CA, USA).

The mzML files were searched with the X!Tandem sequence search engine with the k-score plug-in.

The results of each search were processed through the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline to yield a list of high confidence peptide identifications. ProteinProphet was run on all datasets combined to generate protein identifications and protein groupings, which were then refined and classified according to the Cedar scheme. All peptide sequences were mapped to the Ensembl (www.ensembl.org) version 56 build, thereby allowing us to calculate chromosomal coordinates for peptides found in Ensembl; for the peptides that do not map to Ensembl sequences, chromosomal coordinates are not available.

There are several collapsible sections, each of which provides a related set of information about the protein. The first section provides an overview of information about the protein in general. Next, observed peptides are shown in red on the full protein amino acid sequence, and more information about each peptide is provided in the section Distinct Observed Peptides. The section Predicted Highly Observable Peptides lists theoretical peptides for the protein digested in silico by different prediction software tools.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12328, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "An overview of the tissue coverage", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12363, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table", "xml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\">\n        <thead>\n          <tr>\n            <th align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tissues</th>\n            <th align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Number of experiments</th>\n            <th align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Number of canonical proteins at 1% FDR</th>\n            <th align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Number of peptides at 0.2 % PSM FDR</th>\n          </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mammary epithelial cells</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1061</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3473</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Colostrum</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">342</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1003</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Milk</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">747</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2061</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Udder</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">803</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2778</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Hoof</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">385</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1042</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mitochondria</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1081</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3656</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\">\n              <hr/>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<bold>Total (unique)</bold>\n</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">107</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1921</td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8559</td>\n          </tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n"}, "text": "Tissues\tNumber of experiments\tNumber of canonical proteins at 1% FDR\tNumber of peptides at 0.2 % PSM FDR\t \tMammary epithelial cells\t21\t1061\t3473\t \tColostrum\t12\t342\t1003\t \tMilk\t24\t747\t2061\t \tUdder\t25\t803\t2778\t \tHoof\t11\t385\t1042\t \tMitochondria\t14\t1081\t3656\t \t\t \tTotal (unique)\t107\t1921\t8559\t \t", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}]
