The contributed MS native data files are analyzed in a standardized way and results are returned to the community through this resource. PeptideAtlas has become an important resource for experiment planning, data mining projects, refining genome annotation, and more recently for the development of targeted proteomics experiments. With the advancement in technology and the broad availability of low cost synthetic peptides, selected reaction monitoring (SRM), also known as multiple reaction monitoring, (MRM) has become a powerful and widely used technique that complements traditional shotgun proteomic approaches. SRM experiments require prior information to define a list of target proteins, proteotypic peptides (PTPs) and optimal fragment ions that can uniquely identify each target. Significant efforts are underway to develop high-quality SRM assays and spectral libraries for entire proteomes in a consistent manner. Once an assay is developed it can be universally applied to allow reproducible identification and quantification of essentially any protein in an organism using this spectral information with the latest tools of SRM and SWATH. In this context, and to make these assays available to the scientific community, a new component of PeptideAtlas was developed named SRMAtlas. The SRMAtlas resource supports tailored queries for assays and returns downloadable transition lists that can be readily deployed in an SRM experiment and thus omit time-intensive development efforts by each user. At present, SRMAtlas comprises assays for the complete yeast (S. cerevisiae) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteomes. Comprehensive SRMAtlas databases of assays for the complete human and murine proteomes will be released (Kusebauch et al., submitted). In order to assess the performance of PTPs and assays in different biological matrices, a third component, the PeptideAtlas SRM Experiment Library (PASSEL) was implemented using the PeptideAtlas framework. PASSEL collects, processes and displays empirically derived SRM data contributed by the scientific community. The three resources PeptideAtlas, SRMAtlas and PASSEL provide different types of information and can be used separately but are directly linked with each other and hosted as a single website (Figure 1).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3681, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Herein we describe, in a collection of five basic and one alternate protocol, the use of the diverse components of the PeptideAtlas Project.

The SRMAtlas comprises high-quality SRM assays that have been generated in a consistent manner for entire proteomes by measuring known synthetic peptides, and to significantly lesser extent natural peptides, on different MS instruments primarily of the quadrupole type. PeptideAtlas was utilized to determine the most suitable proteotypic peptides from prior MS measurements in the assay development process of these whole proteome libraries. A simple web-based form allows the user to query the SRMAtlas and tailor searches to obtain the best performing peptides and their transitions for every protein in a proteome. The assays can be readily downloaded into a vendor specific acquisition method for the direct deployment in the next SRM experiment. At present SRMAtlas provides builds for the entire yeast and Mtb proteome, assays to target specific human and murine N-glyco-proteins, and a partial human and murine build mainly constructed from public available ion-trap data are available. SRMAtlas whole proteome builds for human, murine, bovine, porcine and rabbit with quadruple derived assays will be available here. Ion trap observed and predicted peptides can be used to fill the gap as only few proteomes have a nearly complete coverage by multiple SRM assays, but fragmentation patterns need to be verified.

In discovery proteomics, also named shotgun proteomics, peptides are fragmented by collision induced dissociation (CID) in a tandem mass spectrometer. The acquired MS/MS spectra are then scanned against a protein sequence database using pattern matching algorithms, SEQUEST (UNIT 13.3), X!Tandem etc., to assign the peptide sequences and infer from these the proteins. Shotgun proteomics is the preferred method to determine the protein composition of a sample as thousands of peptides can be detected in a single analysis. One drawback of this method is the stochastic nature of the precursor selection process and the difficulty in identifying low abundant proteins. SRM as a targeted method is typically performed on triple-quadrupole MS instruments where the first quadrupole (Q1) is used as filter for the precursor ion of a peptide, the second quadrupole (Q2) acts as collision cell to fragment the precursor ion and the third quadrupole (Q3) filters the predefined fragment ions. This process is monitored over time and results in a chromatographic trace. The pair of m/z values that are isolated in Q1 and Q3 are referred to as transition and a set of transitions that describe a peptide is termed an SRM assay. SRM enables a far lower limit of detection and shows improved reproducibility compared to traditional shotgun approaches, but fewer peptides can be identified in a single analysis. Therefore SRM is predominantly applied to identify and quantify a set of PTPs across multiple samples to quantify proteins of interest such as assessing biomarker candidates in different clinical samples or measuring stoichiometric changes in proteins from a network of proteins under study by some cellular perturbation. In order to develop SRM assays, PTPs need to be defined and comprise those of having a high likelihood to be observed in a mass spectrometer and which uniquely identify a protein. Results from shotgun proteomic experiments can also be utilized to decide on such peptides.

Certain aspects to keep in mind when using the described resources to plan an SRM experiment are summarized here. When a user queries the SRMAtlas and no result has been returned, double-check the selected constraints in the form tab, complete protein accession(s) in the correct namespace are required, e.g. Rv3133c instead of the incomplete Rv3133 accession number. In case a high value was set for \u2018Number of highest Intensity Fragment Ions to Keep\u2019, e.g. 10, less fragment ions may get returned for short peptides as ten fragments may not be available. Reported RTs in SRMAtlas and PASSEL may need to be adjusted to the user\u2019s specific LC setup but are good places to start when no other information on RTs is available. Retention times can be used by selecting a wider RT window in the MS method at first, but also the use of specific RT peptides for RT correction or by performing unscheduled experiments are other good approaches. When assays are downloaded from SRMAtlas in a vendor specific format, the collision energy will be accounted for appropriately. When assays are downloaded from PASSEL, the collision energy used to acquire the data on a specific instrument is reported, if the assays get deployed on a different instrument, the appropriate collision energy for each peptide needs to be calculated.
