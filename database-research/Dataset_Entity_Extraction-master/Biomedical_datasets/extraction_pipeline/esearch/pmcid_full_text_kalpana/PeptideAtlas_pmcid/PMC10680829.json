There is great genetic diversity both within and between varietal groups. Major efforts are underway to understand that diversity through genomic techniques, and to exploit diversity to find alleles conferring desirable traits (such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses), which could be bred into high yielding varieties. The genome sequence of a reference Japonica variety, Nipponbare, was sequenced by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP), with a first release of gene models in 2005.

A key component relates to understanding cell signalling, such as fast responses to the detection of stress, via reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins.
