These standards are spiked into the biological sample of interest and the absolute concentration of the endogenous peptides, and proteins can directly be determined by calculating the ratio of the measured intensities of the spiked-in heavy and the endogenous light forms. For economic reasons, usually only few proteins are quantified using SIS peptides in a single study. To overcome this limitation, multiple absolute label-free methods have been developed in recent years, which allow the estimation of absolute protein abundances for all or a significant fraction of the identified proteins. For a recent discussion and comparison of the methods, see. What these methods have in common is that they either use the linear log\u2013log correlation between absolute protein abundance and experimentally estimated protein intensity or an estimate of the total protein concentration of the sample. However, they differ in their protein intensity inference strategy and to date each requires its own computational framework.
