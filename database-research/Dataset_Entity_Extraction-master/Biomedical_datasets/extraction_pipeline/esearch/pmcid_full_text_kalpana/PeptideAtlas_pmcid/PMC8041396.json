Several public repositories host information on targeted proteomics assays, including NCI\u2019s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium assay portals, PeptideAtlas SRM Experiment Library, SRMAtlas, PanoramaWeb, and PeptideTracker, with all offering varying levels of details. We introduced MRMAssayDB in 2018 as an integrated resource for targeted proteomics assays. The Web-based application maps and links the assays from the repositories, includes comprehensive up-to-date protein and sequence annotations, and provides multiple visualization options on the peptide and protein level.
