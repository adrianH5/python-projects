The cost of each sub-query can be relatively high, for instance, protein sequence scanning using the N-glycosylation pattern \u2013 n{p} [st]{p}, has a high cost and gives many hits. Use of a standard SQL query would take an unacceptable time. Efficient queries require incorporation of Oracle instructions covering the execution plan and query assignment to the best index table. Such a complex query cannot rely on the Oracle cost optimiser and the database engine needs to be guided by Oracle optimiser hints. A popular solution for this problem is parameterisation of the query and tuning it manually to reach an acceptable performance. Assignment of optimiser hints is difficult. Design of an efficient general query system is challenging when combining chemical search, 3D motifs and sequences into a single query where the approach with pre-tuned queries leads to an exponential number of these queries. To achieve fast queries we developed a JAVA package that generates SQL with the necessary structure and optimiser hints leading to an optimal execution plan for the Oracle RDBMS. The approach wraps each search element into a sub-query, then the query generator applies a set of rules and uses preloaded statistics about the cost of a sub-query. First of all it selects a leading sub-query on the basis of the minimal number of expected rows. Then it decides which sub-queries must be executed independently. These second sub-queries will be combined using Cartesian or hash join where the latter is preferable.

This approach takes the starting \u03d5/\u03c8 values from the resulting web page (Figure 3) for residues 77 and 79 with the constraints that the angles deviate by \u00b1 60 degrees and we limit matches to be from different SCOP families only.
