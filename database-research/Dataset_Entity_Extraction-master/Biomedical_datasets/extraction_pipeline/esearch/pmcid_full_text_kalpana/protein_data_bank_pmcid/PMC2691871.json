The protein dynamics that are important to biological function often happen on a timescale that is unattainable through detailed simulation methods such as molecular dynamics as they often involve crossing high-energy barriers. To address this coarse-grained motion, several methods have been implemented as web servers in which a set of coordinates is usually linearly interpolated from an initial crystallographic structure to a final crystallographic structure. We present a new morphing method that does not extrapolate linearly and can therefore go around high-energy barriers and which can produce different trajectories between the same two starting points. In this work, we evaluate our method and other established coarse-grained methods according to an objective measure: how close a coarse-grained dynamics method comes to a crystallographically determined intermediate structure when calculating a trajectory between the initial and final crystal protein structure. We test this with a set of five proteins with at least three crystallographically determined on-pathway high-resolution intermediate structures from the Protein Data Bank.

Along with the complicated conformational change, the protein itself is also the largest in our test set with 994 residues, making this a very difficult problem. The Ca2+-ATPase cycle can be described as follows: The pump exists in two distinct conformations, E1 and E2. In the E1 conformation, the pump is empty and exposes two high-affinity sites for Ca2+ binding to the cytoplasm of the SR. Initially, two Ca2+ ions are bound (E1-2Ca2+ conformation) and ATP is bound (E1-2Ca2+-ATP conformation) in the cytoplasm.
