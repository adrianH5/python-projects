A more general method, described in, used scores based on atom pairs that contact across interfaces combined with iterative partitioning of the graph representing crystal contacts in order to predict complexes. This method gave a 16% error rate on a non-redundant set of 218 X-ray structures. The Protein Quaternary Structure (PQS) server discriminates biological and crystal contacts based on a weighted score computed from the interface accessible area, number of interface residues, solvation energy, and the number of salt bridges and disulphide bonds. Finally, a new prediction method and web server, PISA, was introduced during the course of this work. That method used an empirical estimate of both enthalpic and entropic contributions to the binding free energy in order to predict stable complexes. Small ligands were also included in the free energy calculation. Although there are many online databases that contain analyses of protein complex structures obtained from other sources, such as BIOMT annotation or PQS, there are currently only two other databases that contain predictions of complexes for the entire PDB, namely PQS and PISA.

First, protein-protein interfaces are grouped by similarity and all interfaces in a particular cluster are either all predicted to be specific (biological) contacts or non-specific (crystal) contacts. Crystal contacts are defined to be protein-protein interfaces that only occur in the non-physiological environment of the crystal (e.g. high protein concentration, low temperature, and compounds added to aid crystallization). Because all interfaces in a cluster containing biological interfaces are between proteins with similar amino acid sequences and have similar binding geometry, they presumably arose through evolutionary divergence. Thus they provide a valuable resource for studying how similar interfaces appear in different complexes of diverse functions. Second, the protein-protein interface clusters are classified by a machine learning method that utilizes a robust set of diverse interface properties. Previously we demonstrated that a similar set of properties was sufficient to distinguish near-native docked conformations in a large set of decoys. The combination of a large set of properties and a more sophisticated statistical model is expected to yield more accurate interface predictions. Third, the prediction method incorporates all PDB structures (as we are using interface clusters across the PDB) rather that making a separate prediction on individual structures.

Both the residue-level and atomic-level properties were previously shown to distinguish protein-protein interfaces.

The number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds was determined by adding hydrogen atoms and optimizing their geometry using the ICM program and counting the number of potential hydrogen donor/acceptor pairs within 2.5 \u00c5 of each other. Intermolecular disulfide bonds were defined by two cysteine residues with S-S separations between 1.5 \u00c5 and 2.5 \u00c5.

Although clustering a large number of interfaces would be computationally expensive, the clustering problem can be subdivided into manageable subproblems. First identical interfaces, with the same proteins and same relative space transformation, within each PDB complex were rapidly identified and grouped. Next, all non-identical interfaces throughout the PDB were clustered using hierarchical complete linkage clustering with distance measure 1-O and the largest clusters with O \u2265 0.3 were selected.
