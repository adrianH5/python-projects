Another complication that needs to be considered when ranking individual chains or domains is the possibility that the modelled part of a structure may not cover the complete protein molecule or sequence domain. In the case of X-ray crystallographic structures the ranking is further complicated by the common practice of not modelling regions of the molecule that lack clear and unambiguous electron density.

This might be owing to a number of factors such as the large increase in the number of structures deposited in the late 1990s or that larger or more difficult structures were being solved. Following the increase, there has been a gradual decrease to around 3% median outliers that could be owing to improved refinement and building protocols (Emsley et al., 2010).

The wwPDB partners have established VTFs that have recommended community-accepted validation criteria for model coordinates and specific metrics for assessing experimental data for each experiment type. Based on the recommendations of the VTFs, the wwPDB has implemented a validation pipeline that supports the efforts by the structural biology community to improve the quality of the structure models deposited in the PDB. The validation pipeline integrates community-accepted standard software for assessing the quality of macromolecular models and experimental data. The validation pipeline also provides, for the first time, a method for assessing the geometry of bound molecules using the CCDC Mogul software.

Our analysis shows that ranking of relevant entries using validation information can help to identify the \u2018best\u2019 representative.

One danger of VRs is that a \u2018clean report\u2019 becomes an aim in itself, as opposed the production of a model that is the most faithful interpretation of the experimental data in the light of the prior knowledge. If a model is slightly adjusted to get rid of validation issues then this is unlikely to produce any meaningful improvement in its real quality; instead, the VR criteria are then used as a \u2018refinement target\u2019 and lose their value as independent validation criteria (Kleywegt, 2000). VRs do not currently include any evaluation of difference density peaks or unmodelled \u2018blobs\u2019 of difference density (Emsley et al., 2010). Hence, it is often possible to cosmetically \u2018improve\u2019 a VR, without meaningful improvement of the model, simply by removing parts of the structure that are flagged as outliers, albeit at the cost of a small increase in R free.
