The dataset contains more than 200,000 structures, consisting of EMDB maps,14 PDB atomic models, and their biological assemblies. We established a new method, incremental distance rank (iDR) profile comparison, to rapidly search through this large dataset. The iDR profile is a one\u2010dimensional profile of the distances of points, which are generated by the vector quantization method implemented in the Situs package.26 As a search query, the user can use a structure in the databanks or an original structure by uploading it to the server. In addition, the user can obtain the 3D fitting of the query with a found similar structure by gmfit,27 which uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM).

Each of the models is represented by one of three types of structures: atomic model, dummy atom model, and a mixture of them. The dummy atom model is also known as SAS bead model, which represents a molecular structure by a set of same spheres (dummy atoms or beads). Most of models employ a sphere corresponding to the amino acid size (radius\u2009=\u20091. 9 \u00c5), but some use larger spheres. The iDR profile comparison and the GMM fitting are both compatible with all of the models. Now, the user can search the structure data in the SASBDB as well as a 3D map in the EMDB or an atomic model in the PDB. The user can also obtain the fitted view of the query structure onto found similar structures in any combination of data types, including the dummy atom model.

Therefore, we implemented two types of filters, keyword and database.

This is why we have employed the iDR profile for the search and GMM for the fitting of the found structures. When the number of entries is in the range of hundreds, the computational time is on the order of minutes and is sufficiently practical. Now the user can re\u2010order the top 100 similar structures in the search results by the cross\u2010correlation coefficient value obtained by the GMM fitting. Using this functionality, within an additional several minutes, the user can obtain more accurate search results.
