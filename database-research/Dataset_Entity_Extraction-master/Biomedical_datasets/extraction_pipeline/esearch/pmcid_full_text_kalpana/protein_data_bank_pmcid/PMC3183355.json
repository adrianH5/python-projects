Ligands are \u2018docked\u2019 by superimposing a common stem fragment among the compounds in the series using a crystal complex from the Protein Databank, and sampling the conformational space of the variable region. Our results show good correlation between our predicted rankings and experimental data for cases in which binding affinities differ by at least one order of magnitude. For 11 out of 12 cases, >90% of such ligand pairs could be correctly ranked, while for the remaining case, Factor Xa, 76% of such pairs were correctly ranked. A small number of compounds could not be docked using the current protocol due to the large size of functional groups that could not be accommodated by a rigid receptor. CPU requirements for the method, involving CPU-minutes per ligand, are modest compared with more rigorous methods that use similar force fields, such as free energy perturbation.

Another line of work, by ourselves and others, has examined whether molecular mechanics energy functions can be used in a much simpler, and more approximate, manner as a \u2018scoring function\u2019 for protein-ligand docking. Most of this work employs implicit solvent models, as opposed to the explicit treatment of water typically used in free energy simulations, for computational expediency.

Longer term, these methods will be able to exploit advances in force fields and solvent models, such as the new generation of polarizable force fields. One major limitation has simply been computational expense. Most docking scoring functions have much simpler functional forms; the computational cost of implicit solvent models is particularly challenging. As a result, most of the results we cite above which have successfully used force fields with implicit solvent models did not use such energy functions exclusively. In most cases, a docking program employing a more common docking scoring function was used to position ligands in a protein binding site, and the molecular mechanics/implicit solvent scoring function was used only to \u2018rescore\u2019 these poses. Similarly, in a widely adopted approach to treating protein flexibility in ligand docking (\u2018induced fit\u2019), a docking program using an empirical scoring function and a protein modeling program using a molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) scoring function are used iteratively to treat ligand and protein degrees of freedom, respectively.
