Long-range inhibitory neuronal nitric oxide synthase-expressing cells (LINCs), a population of hippocampal neurons, were recently identified as a unique source of widespread inhibition in CA1, able to elicit both GABAA-mediated and GABAB-mediated postsynaptic inhibition. We therefore hypothesized that LINCs could be an effective target for seizure control. LINCs were optogenetically activated for on-demand seizure intervention in the intrahippocampal kainate (KA) mouse model of chronic TLE. Unexpectedly, LINC activation at 1 month post-KA did not substantially reduce seizure duration in either male or female mice. We tested two different sets of stimulation parameters, both previously found to be effective with on-demand optogenetic approaches, but neither was successful. Quantification of LINCs following intervention revealed a substantial reduction of LINC numbers compared with saline-injected controls. We also observed a decreased number of LINCs when the site of initial insult (i.e., KA injection) was moved to the amygdala [basolateral amygdala (BLA)-KA], and correspondingly, no effect of light delivery on BLA-KA seizures. This indicates that LINCs may be a vulnerable population in TLE, regardless of the site of initial insult. To determine whether long-term circuitry changes could influence outcomes, we continued testing once a month for up to 6\u2009months post-KA. However, at no time point did LINC activation provide meaningful seizure suppression. Altogether, our results suggest that LINCs are not a promising target for seizure inhibition in TLE.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1838, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Significance Statement", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1861, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Novel treatments are needed for temporal lobe epilepsy, and altering inhibitory signaling may provide seizure control.

Additionally, those who can find some relief may experience a range of negative side effects including nausea, liver dysfunction, bone degradation, and chronic cognitive impairments. Dysregulation of GABAergic signaling is a known key ictogenic factor. However, the limited efficacy and negative side effects of antiseizure drugs that indiscriminately elevate inhibitory signaling emphasize the need to consider the timing of interventions, circuit changes in epilepsy, and the heterogeneity of GABAergic signaling to develop high-specificity treatments that can provide seizure control while limiting side effects. There is incredible diversity of GABAergic signaling and GABAergic neurons. For example, in CA1, a subregion of the hippocampus, there are >20 types of inhibitory neurons identified. Recent work has identified and characterized additional CA1 populations, and genomic analysis suggests that even more populations remain poorly characterized.

While the role of PV cells in seizures appears to be situation specific, and may not be the same for all subtypes, previous work using on-demand optogenetic activation of PV cells at the onset of seizures in the intrahippocampal kainate (IHKA) mouse model of chronic TLE demonstrated successful hippocampal seizure inhibition.

(1) Despite being a relatively sparse inhibitory cell population, LINCs provide widespread inhibition within CA1. Optogenetic activation of LINCs in hippocampal slices resulted in postsynaptic inhibition of 80% of all patched cells in CA1, including both superficial and deep pyramidal cells.

However, nNOS is also expressed by excitatory neurons, which far outnumber LINCs. Thus, it was only with a dual-targeting strategy that the investigation of LINCs could be achieved: specifically, as done previously, we targeted LINCs via their expression of both nNOS and Dlx5/6 (a transcription factor expressed by GABAergic neurons of the forebrain).

First and foremost, we noted a substantial decrease in the number of LINCs in epileptic tissue, resulting in very few remaining eYFP-ChR2-expressing cells. This, obviously, reduces the number of LINCs that can be activated by our on-demand optogenetic approach, limiting the potential impact of LINC activation. PV cells can also be lost in epilepsy, including in the IHKA model of TLE. We found that the average number of PV-immunopositive cells in IHKA animals was reduced by 54% across the entire anterior\u2013posterior axis, and by 79% specifically at the location light was delivered in this study. This percentage reduction at the site of light delivery was similar to the percentage reduction observed in eYFP-ChR2-labeled LINCs. How can PV cells then remain a viable target? First, the absolute number of remaining PV cells at the location of light delivery in this study was approximately five times that of labeled LINCs. Therefore, there would be substantially more cells available to potentially provide seizure control. Additionally, any axons in the path of light could additionally be activated. This is especially relevant, as it has been noted that inhibitory neurons can undergo axonal sprouting in epilepsy. Importantly, this includes sprouting of the axons of PV cells. In the IHKA model of TLE, long-range axonal sprouting from PV cells was noted 4\u20136\u2009months post-KA injection. Axonal sprouting of surviving neurons may help compensate for cell loss. However, for LINCs, if axonal sprouting occurs, it appears to be insufficient to meaningfully impact outcomes: even at late time points, up to a full 6 months post-KA injection, on-demand optogenetic excitation of LINCs failed to provide meaningful seizure suppression (Fig. 3). Even without an epileptic insult, LINCs are a relatively sparse hippocampal neuronal population (; compare also our saline cell counts), and sprouting of the axons of LINCs may be insufficient to overcome a further reduction in their numbers. Additionally, our experimental methods may not have allowed full capitalization of sprouting: most previous work targeting PV neurons in the IHKA model used a transgenic approach, resulting in all PV neurons expressing channelrhodopsin. Therefore, any PV cell now innervating the illuminated area would be able to contribute to seizure inhibition. In contrast to target LINCs, we had to take an intersectional genetic, viral vector-based approach. While we transfected LINCs for channelrhodopsin expression before the epileptogenic insult (to ensure robust transfection), and while we saw good viral spread with our approach (Fig. 2), areas more remote (including the contralateral hippocampus) would not be able to contribute to seizure suppression in the same manner. An additional difference between PV cells and LINCs is also worth noting: in addition to broadly inhibiting CA1 pyramidal cells, in healthy tissue LINCs also provide inhibition to inhibitory neurons. This could theoretically counteract the beneficial effects of inhibition they provide to pyramidal cells. However, many seizure medications increase inhibition broadly with at least some degree of success. Given the dramatic loss of LINCs in epilepsy, a more likely interpretation is insufficient inhibition, rather than poorly directed inhibition. However, a recent study did find greater on-demand optogenetic seizure control when targeting only hippocampal PV cells compared with broadly targeting hippocampal inhibitory interneurons (via DLX6/5).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 56377, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We examined two different stimulation protocols (and neither worked), and we used light stimulation parameters that were previously successful when targeting other neuronal populations.

However, the substantial decrease in the amplitude of LINC-mediated inhibition over the course of the stimulation train may contribute to the poor seizure suppression observed. While it is unclear whether such fatigue could be overcome to allow for more successful intervention strategies, future work could potentially apply methods such as Bayesian optimization to examine whether LINC-mediated seizure suppression could be improved with different stimulation parameters.

Such results would then have failed to translate to situations with the (at times substantial) circuit changes that can happen in chronic temporal lobe epilepsy.

For example, the activation of mossy cells in the dentate gyrus was proconvulsant in an acute seizure model, but anticonvulsant in the IHKA chronic epilepsy model.

Importantly, some of the animals (presumably those with more severe initial epilepsy) were lost to SUDEP over the course of our experiments, which likely contributed to this observed change in seizure durations over time at the group level. A final important aspect to consider is that our experiments were well controlled, with both internal no-light controls and group comparisons to opsin-negative animals that received otherwise identical experimental procedures. The use of opsin-negative animals was critical, as it helped contextualize the small, but at times statistically significant, effects we did observe with light delivery. While some of this may be because of chance, and while effects in opsin-negative animals were always very small, it provided a key point of reference; without this context, we may have overinterpreted the occasional small, but significant, effect in opsin-positive animals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 62133, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although light delivery always resulted in at most small effect sizes in opsin-negative animals, that any significant effect was observed is surprising. What may be driving this small, yet at times significant, effect? Light delivery alone can have impacts on neuronal systems through a variety of mechanisms. Light-induced tissue heating is one such possibility. In the present study, following data collection, light power measured through the tip of the implanted optic fiber was an average of 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 mW. While this is not generally considered a high level of light for optogenetic studies, this amount of light could, in theory, have a small influence on neural activity via tissue heating. However, we found that light power was not correlated with the percentage reduction in seizure duration with light (p\u2009=\u20090.60, Spearman\u2019s correlation), making it unlikely that tissue heating was the critical factor for the observed light-mediated effects. Another potential impact of light delivery alone is the alteration of neurologic activity via the visual pathway. While optical connections were covered to mitigate external light delivery with stimulation, it did not prevent all of it. Therefore, a visual impact theoretically may have contributed to shorter average seizure durations with light. However, if mediated by a visual effect, it does not appear to be impacted by the frequency of light pulses, as the effects were similar between the two sets of stimulation parameters (opsin-negative percentage reduction, 7 vs 1\u2009Hz; p\u2009=\u20090.44,\u2009MW test). Another potential source of light-mediated effects in opsin-negative animals is light-mediated alterations in blood flow (especially with blue light). If light-mediated alterations in blood flow can alter seizures, this could be an interesting avenue for future investigations. However, the very small size of the noted effects is worth remembering. Any future investigations attempting to build on the finding would need to substantially increase the effect to have a meaningful impact on seizures. While any off-target effects of light were not large enough to be clinically relevant in our experiments, they are still an important experimental factor to consider when designing and interpreting results. Consideration of all of these factors led us to the ultimate conclusion that on-demand optogenetic excitation of LINCs cannot provide robust seizure inhibition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 64574, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "LINCs are an understudied hippocampal neuronal population, with a number of unique and exciting features.
