The present study aimed to identify the optimal biological factors that describe the expression profile using a method that mines the gene expression patterns. We propose a novel method named FacPat that can identify key biological factor-specific patterns among chemical compounds, human cell lines, and genes using perturbation-induced gene expression signatures from the L1000 dataset (Fig.\u00a01A). We first constructed an expression profile for every 12,328 genes comprising the gene expression signatures of 51 human cell lines treated with 19 chemical compounds. We assumed that the expression profile was combined with noise and an underlying factor-specific pattern. To quantify the impact of noise, we measured the pattern distance by counting the number of mismatch elements between the observed expression profile and factor-specific pattern. Therefore, the optimal factor-specific pattern had the closest pattern distance between the factor-specific pattern and the observed expression profile. We then used a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal factor-specific pattern for each observed expression profile (Fig.\u00a01B\u2013E) and generated the distribution of pattern distances for each observed expression profile to address multiple testing corrections. Finally, we identified significant and directly interpretable biological factor-specific patterns in the L1000 dataset. FacPat identified the relationships among chemical compounds, human cell lines, and genes that describe the expression profiles. The unique advantage of FacPat lies in its ability to identify these significant patterns without the need for sufficient replications, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional statistical

The third effect suggests that these genes, which are specific to both chemical compounds and cell lines, can be targeted by chemical compounds for treating specific diseases. Moreover, we identified several genes that are potential targets for therapeutic interventions in various cancers. Specifically, two genes, AKAP8 and ADRB2, were associated with SCLC and trichostatin-A (TSA). TSA is an anticancer drug that inhibits the growth of lung cancer cells through histone hyperacetylation, and AKAP8 is involved in DNA replication and condensation during the cell cycle. ADRB2 is associated with the beta-adrenergic receptor (-AR), whose activation promotes the progression of lung cancer. Several studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanism of action of -ARs in lung cancer.

TYMS is a common target gene of HDAC inhibitors and is suppressed by HDAC inhibition. PLCB3 is associated with poor overall survival of patients with NSCLC and poor prognosis of adenocarcinoma; however, the interaction between PLCB3 and TSA has not yet been discovered. DHRS2 is associated with various functions, such as cell proliferation and migration, in many different cancers. In our study, we found that it may be a novel target of TSA in NSCLC.

Therefore, SPTLC2 may be a novel mepacrine target for treating human Ewing\u2019s sarcoma.

In colon cancer, HDAC6 expression is high and associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, TUBA1A may act as a potential target when TSA is used to treat colon cancer. MCOLN1, a member of the mucolipin family of transient receptor potential channels (TRPMLs), is significantly differentially expressed among colon cancer cells.
