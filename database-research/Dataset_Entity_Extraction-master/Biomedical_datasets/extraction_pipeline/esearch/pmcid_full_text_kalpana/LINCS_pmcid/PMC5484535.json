The most significant off-target effects of 5Z7 and its analogs likely stem from cross-reactivity with other human kinases possessing an analogous cysteine. To better understand these activities we profiled 5Z7 at concentrations of 1 and 10 \u03bcM against a diverse panel of 456 kinases using an in vitro ATP-site competition binding assays (KinomeScan, DiscoverX) and found that 5Z7 exhibits a strong inhibition score against many kinases other than TAK1, such as MEKs, PDGFRs and FLTs (Table S1), many of which have a cysteine in the DFG-1 position.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1963, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Pharmacological targets of 5Z7 identified by KinomeScan included kinases involved in the TAK1 signaling as well as complementary oncogenic signaling pathways.

ZAK is another member from the MAP kinase family, which also plays key roles in signaling networks overlapping with TAK1. Other pharmacological targets of 5Z7 discovered by KinomeScan analysis are independent of TAK1 signaling and comprise oncogenic signaling cascades such as the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway and cancer-associated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including PDGFRs, KDR, KIT and FLTs, which activate downstream PI3K/AKT signaling components.

Proliferation of KRAS-dependent colon cancer cells can be selectively impaired with shRNA knockdown of TAK1, an apparent phenocopy of 5Z7 exposure. Moreover, blocking TAK1 activity with 5Z7 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in an analogous fashion to a TAK1 kinase-dead mutant. Inhibition of TAK1 with 5Z7 diminished subarachnoid hemorrhage induced neuronal apoptosis and early brain injury. Upregulation of TAK1 has also been observed in patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) CD34+ cells, and pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 by 5Z7 correlated with cancer outcomes.

When activated, SF secrete a set of cytokines that are pro-inflammatory, abundant in synovial fluid from RA patients and serve to activate immune cells. The exposure of activated SF to 5Z7 and NG25 normalizes their secretory landscape, in a TAK1dependent fashion. We therefore evaluated the effects of 2, 5, 8, 25, and 26 to normalize activation of SF from an RA patient (SF donor sample RA2159; Cell Applications, Inc.) using a multi-factorial assay in which Luminex-based sandwich immunoassays were used to profile the levels of 48 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. We then computed the effects of inhibitors on cytokines whose secretion was induced using interaction-based multiple linear regression (iMLR; Fig S4). We then scaled inhibitor iMLR coefficients by the coefficients for TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, or Poly(I:C) activators, where 0 indicates no effect and \u22121 indicates complete inhibition of induced secretion.

The effects of 5Z7, 2, 5 and 25 on cytokine secretion by activated SF were significantly correlated, suggesting that similar targets were blocked by all compounds.

Indeed, many pathological states such as cancer and diseases of the central nervous system involve multiple genotypic abnormalities, and targeted polypharmacology may provide therapeutic benefits. In oncology the advantage of targeting multiple cellular processes is reflected in firmly established multi-drug regimens used as the current standard of care for treatment of multiple cancer types such as adriamycin, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide and herceptin (ATCH) for breast cancer, adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, cisplatin and etoposide (EP) for small cell lung cancer, and vincristine, actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) for rhabdomyosarcoma. In an era of molecularly targeted therapies \u2018combination therapy\u2019 has been incorporated into many clinical trials as researchers have gained a more complete understanding of the biological complexities of cancer and have recognized the limitations of targeted monotherapies including the development of drug resistance. Given this background, targeted polypharmacology may have significant advantages not only from a biological perspective, but also from regulatory approval, economic and drug-drug interaction perspectives. Indeed, several agents exhibiting targeted polypharmacology are already used in clinical settings. For example sorafenib is thought to act by a dual mechanism in some contexts with activity against the Ras/Raf pathway inhibiting tumor growth and activity against VEGFR and PDGFR inhibiting angiogenesis. Lenvatinib, an inhibitor with activity against VEGFR1\u20133, PDGFR\u03b1, FGFR1\u20134, RET and c-Kit kinases has also shown efficacy attributable to its multi-target mechanism. The compounds described in this study overlap with 5Z7 with respect to TAK1 inhibition but appear to differ with respect to other targets; thus, they complement 5Z7 and provide valuable tools for studying TAK1-centered polyphamacology in cancer and RA.
