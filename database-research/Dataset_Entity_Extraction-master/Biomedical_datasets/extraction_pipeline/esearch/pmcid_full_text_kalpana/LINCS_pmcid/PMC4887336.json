Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were exposed to eleven drugs with diverse mechanism of action. Growth rates, IC50, Emax, and GR metrics were estimated by imaging and counting fixed cells 72 h after treatment (Supplementary Data 2).

In BT-20 and SK-BR-3 cells, division rate increased with density, presumably due to conditioning of the growth medium. Correlations between density and IC50 and Emax were the weakest for MCF7 cells, which grew equally well across all densities. Thus, the effect of density on number of divisions, and consequently on IC50 and Emax, varied dramatically with cell line (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Cell division rate slows down in some cell lines as density increases while speeding up in others. Such variation can change apparent IC50 100-fold or more and therefore introduces artificial correlations in data, obscures the true effects of drug action, and introduces unknown complications into biomarker discovery.

To the first approximation, cell growth can be considered exponential, with drugs either decreasing the division rate or killing cells in a cell cycle-dependent manner:  where x is the cell count, k is the untreated growth rate (per day), c is the drug concentration, SM is the maximal inhibitory effect, SC50 is the concentration at half-maximal effect of drug, and h the Hill coefficient. The growth rate k corresponds to the division rate k0 as k = ln(2)\u00b7k0 = ln(2)/Td, where Td is the division time. SM can be larger than 1 to account for drugs inducing cell death at a specific phase of the cell cycle. The model can also be generalized to account for drugs that induce cell death independent of the cell cycle:  where kL is the maximal killing rate (per day), LC50 is the concentration of drug that produces half-maximal cell killing. Integrating these equations for an assay of t days yields the cell count at concentration c:  where x0 \u2261 x(t = 0) is the cell number at the time of treatment. Thus, the relative cell count is:  and the normalized growth rate inhibition (GR value) is:  This equation for GR(c) is independent of the length of the assay t and thus, the metrics GR50, GRmax, GRAUC, and hGR are also independent of t. For cases where drug action is mainly related to the cell cycle (kL =0), GR values are also independent of the untreated growth rate k. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3a\u2013b, the impact of kL>0 is minimal on GR50 and relatively small on GRmax. This is also illustrated by the analytical formula for GRinf\u00b7GRinf = 2^(1 \u2212 SM \u2212 kL/k) \u2212 1. Note that the metrics derived from growth inhibition (GI) values used in Heiser et al. such as GI50 are more robust than traditional metrics, but still depend on both division time and assay length
