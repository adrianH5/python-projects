At present, two advances are poised to facilitate new strategies. First, the LINCS project can provide rich transcriptome data that reflect the responses of cells upon exposure to various drugs. Second, machine learning algorithms have been applied successfully in biomedical research. In this paper, we developed a systematic method to discover novel indications for existing drugs by approaching drug repositioning as a multi-label classification task and used a Softmax regression model to predict previously unrecognized therapeutic properties of drugs based on LINCS transcriptome data. This approach to complete the said task has not been achieved in previous studies. By performing in silico comparison, we demonstrated that the proposed Softmax method showed markedly superior performance over those of other methods. Once fully trained, the method showed a training accuracy exceeding 80% and a validation accuracy of approximately 70%. We generated a highly credible set of 98 drugs with high potential to be repositioned for novel therapeutic purposes.

Moreover, multi-functions of drug targets have contributed to drug repurposing. This innovative paradigm in drug development is economically attractive, low risk, and time saving.

Drug data containing 978 landmark genes and labels corresponding to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification were gathered from the LINCS and DrugBank databases. During supervised learning, we tried different generative models and discriminative models in the hypothesis space to fit the data. Multi-label SVM could be implemented efficiently with additional expensive computations, and the dataset was not linearly separable given that the number of support vectors (over 500) exceeded the number of classes. The performance of the random forest (RF) method, a common classifier that combines decision trees, depends on the integrity of feature values, but a small ratio of observed values to the full value range was obtained in this task. Both SVM and RF encountered a challenge of class imbalance problems, especially for several classes with small proportions. Data synthesis is a common tool to avoid class imbalance, but no reliable approach can achieve this goal in this domain. In order to denoise and extract high-level features to represent raw data, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that consists of convolution and max pooling operations (as shown in Fig.\u00a01B). The convolution layers contained several kernels to extract different types of features. The max pooling layers are responsible for integrating local features to improve translation invariance. Even if different kernels in the same layer shared parameters, the structure of CNN is highly complicated to be fully trained.
