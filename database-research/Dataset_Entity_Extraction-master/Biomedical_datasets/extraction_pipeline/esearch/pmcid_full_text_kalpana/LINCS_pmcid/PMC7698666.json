The estimation/identification of unknown parameters is a critical task of model building, and when fitting a kinetic model from data or evaluating model predictions (e.g. in Chassagnole et al., Khodayari et al. and Mannan et al.), a curated repository with metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics data will be essential. Alternatively, curated databases such as BRENDA and SABIO-RK provide relevant kinetic information (rate equations and experimentally derived kinetic parameters) available in the literature, which can support the model construction or extension, while repositories like BioModels and JWS Online stored Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models and their properties.

The public repository is focused on data dissemination and collaboration procedures to facilitate data reuse by the systems biology modelers and experimentalists.

Moreover, quantitative data are usually difficult for a direct comparison between the simulated and measured data because of the formats and units used. Thus, it is essential that the experimental data and models are stored in a structured format and according to standards well known by the community. For experimental data, the Minimum Information standards, created in 2008, is used and called the Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI) project. For instance, the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME), part of MIBBI, was created to describe microarrays with the minimum information possible. Metadata is also a very important aspect to take into account when storing experimental data. Experience details, description and other important information can help to better understand the experimental set-up and procedure. The ISA (Investigation\u2013Study\u2013Assay) format is an open-source tool that allows producing detailed metadata information, enhancing the reproducibility and reusability of the data. For storing mathematical models, SBML is the most common standard, and it is based on XML.

These new features are in accordance with the FAIR standards, and along with the introduction of a unique persistent identifier system make KiMoSys a Findable repository. In addition, the number of records and source publications consulted has increased. We believe that KiMoSys 2.0 will be very helpful to the systems biology modeling community. In the future, KiMoSys will be routinely maintained as the collection/curation of data (and associated kinetic models) is ongoing.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22918, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22929, "infons": {"fpage": "417", "lpage": "421", "name_0": "surname:Clarke;given-names:D.J.", "name_1": "surname:Wang;given-names:L.", "name_2": "surname:Jones;given-names:A.", "pub-id_pmid": "31677972", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Cell Syst.", "type": "ref", "volume": "9", "year": "2019"}, "text": "FAIRshake: toolkit to evaluate the FAIRness of research digital resources", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23003, "infons": {"fpage": "1", "lpage": "14", "name_0": "surname:Machado;given-names:D.", "name_1": "surname:Costa;given-names:R.S.", "name_2": "surname:Rocha;given-names:M.", "pub-id_pmid": "21906327", "section_type": "REF", "source": "AMB Express", "type": "ref", "volume": "1", "year": "2011"}, "text": "Modeling formalisms in systems biology", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23042, "infons": {"fpage": "53", "lpage": "73", "name_0": "surname:Chassagnole;given-names:C.", "name_1": "surname:Noisommit-Rizzi;given-names:N.", "name_2": "surname:Schmid;given-names:J.W.", "pub-id_pmid": "17590932", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Biotechnol.
