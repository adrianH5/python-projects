We therefore hypothesized that compounds mimicking this transcriptome, particularly by activating FOXO/DAF\u201016 itself, would also induce conserved longevity effects. Specifically, FOXO3 expression has been associated with long\u2010lived populations of humans in several independent cohorts (Broer et al.,; Morris et al.,; Soerensen et al.,) suggesting that activation of this pathway is one of the most promising routes to benefiting human age\u2010related diseases. Our top five FOXO3\u2010mimetic compounds led to varied effects both in mammalian cell culture and worm lifespan. This provides an important reminder that similar downstream transcriptional profiles do not always reflect a specific mode of action, and do not always lead to similar physiological outcomes. A clear example of this fact was demonstrated by zidovudine, which robustly extended lifespan, but was not dependent on daf\u201016, suggesting that its effects on gene expression\u2014inducing a FOXO\u2010overexpression\u2010like transcriptome\u2014are caused by factors other than direct activation of the transcription factor itself. Effects of NRTIs have been studied previously in C. elegans and are hypothesized to inhibit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase \u03b3 function, leading to a depletion of mtDNA, and decreased mitochondrial respiration due to a lack of subunits of the respiratory chain (Brinkman et al.,). However, C. elegans exposed to zidovudine have relatively modest reductions in mtDNA and yet simultaneously experience diminished oxygen consumption and alterations to mitochondrial morphology (de Boer et al.,). Impairment of mitochondrial function is a well\u2010established lifespan extension mechanism (van der Rijt et al.,), so we expect that this is also the mechanism by which zidovudine extends lifespan in worms. While this mechanism is not the focus of our current study, we remain intrigued by the fact that FOXO's longevity signature is potentially activated through other means.
