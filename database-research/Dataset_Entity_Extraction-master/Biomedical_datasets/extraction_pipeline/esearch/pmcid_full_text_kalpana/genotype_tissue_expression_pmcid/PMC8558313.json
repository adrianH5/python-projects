Taking post-transcriptional modulation into consideration, no doubt abnormally dysregulated RBPs are intimately associated with the incidence and development of many diseases, such as cancers.

PTRF, alias Cavin1, is recognized as a non-canonical RBP in GBM and is also identified as a prognosis-related factor.

GNL3L has been discovered as a factor involved in the maintenance of the tumorigenic properties of tumor-initiating cells. Moreover, GNL3L may enhance NF-\u03baB-regulated tumor cell viability via the upregulation of antiapoptosis-related genes. However, no previous study has assessed the effects of GNL3L in GBM. As for KHDRBS2, although the relation of KHDRBS2 overexpression to better OS in lung adenocarcinoma is well understood, little is known about it in GBM.
