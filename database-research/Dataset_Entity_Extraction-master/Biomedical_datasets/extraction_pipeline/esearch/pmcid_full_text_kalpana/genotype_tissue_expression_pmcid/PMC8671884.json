Pyroptosis has been demonstrated to be related with tumor progression and prognosis. Nevertheless, no studies exist that delineated the role of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in STS. In the present study, we comprehensively and systematically analyzed the gene expression profiles of PRGs in STS. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases were utilized to identify differentially expressed PRGs. In total, 34 PRGs were aberrantly expressed between STS and normal tissues. Several PRGs were validated with RT-qPCR. Consensus clustering analysis based on PRGs was conducted to divide STS patients into two clusters, and significant survival difference was observed between two distinct clusters (p = 0.019). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between pyroptosis-related clusters. Based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression analysis, the pyroptosis-related gene signature with five key DEGs was constructed. The high pyroptosis-related risk score group of TCGA cohort was characterized by poorer prognosis (p < 0.001), with immune infiltration and function significantly decreased. For external validation, STS patients from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were grouped according to the same cut-off point. The survival difference between two risk groups of GEO cohort was also significant (p < 0.001). With the combination of clinical characteristics, pyroptosis-related risk score was identified to serve as an independent prognostic factor for STS patients.

It was estimated that there were 13,460 cases with STS in the United States in 2021. STS originated from mesenchymal tissues with more than 100 different subtypes according to the histology and genetic alterations, which displayed various clinical behaviors. Although STS could arise in any body site, it exhibited a predilection to occur in the extremity and intra-abdominal region. Surgical procedures are the cornerstones of STS treatment. The past few decades also have witnessed the evolution of therapeutic strategies for STS, with the collaboration of multidisciplinary team (MDT) including radiologists, pathologists, oncologists and surgical specialists. However, for elderly patients with STS, 5-years relative survival was below 50%. Additionally, STS was also characterized by the susceptibility to distant metastasis and recurrence. Nearly half of patients with localized STS developed distant metastasis, especially to the lung and leading to poor prognosis.

It was reported that pyroptosis-associated PRRs consist of intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs). In recent years, gasdermin D (GSDMD) was reported as the executioner of pyroptosis, as it released N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-cNT) to induce cell swelling after caspase cleavage. Likely, other gasdermin family genes including GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC and GSDME also take part in the process of pyroptosis.

Similarly, PRGs included in this study were relatively consistent with those in studies focusing on pyroptosis in other tumor types. Due to constraints of the TCGA data, normal tissue samples were extremely limited in TCGA-SARC cohort. Thus, GTEx including expression profiles of normal human tissues was the optimal data resource. The gene expression data of TCGA and GTEx were merged through sufficiently rigorous procedures, and this novel method has been confirmed by several studies concerning TCGA-SARC cohort. Besides, PRGs identified in this study showed good ability to distinguish STS from normal samples. Based on the differentially expressed PRGs sets, tumor-infiltrated and normal tissues could be clearly distinguished, which was strongly suggestive of the role in tumor diagnosis. Consensus clustering analysis was a proven method to demonstrate distinct subtypes and survival patterns of malignant tumors. The clustering of subtypes of TCGA-SACR cohort provided an opportunity to identify biological differences of STS based on PRGs. STS patients in pyroptosis-related cluster two had substantially better prognosis, with most PRGs significantly upregulated within this cluster. Remarkably, the previous study has demonstrated that the ATP releasing by dying tumor cells would act on P2X7 purinergic receptors and subsequently trigger NLRP3-CASP1 complex (inflammasome) to mediate the innate and adaptive immune responses against dying tumor cells. In keeping with previous findings, the current study also identified significant upregulation of NLRP3 and CASP1 in the pyroptosis-related cluster 2, which was probably related with underlying mechanisms of different prognosis in STS clusters.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26448, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The DEGs analysis between two pyroptosis-related clusters was further conducted to establish the risk score system, which was also a proven method of identifying different risk tumor patterns.

Importantly, pyroptosis-related signature was established based on five key DEGs by LASSO COX regression analysis. Besides, solely relying on a single gene for diagnosis and prognosis prediction was inaccurate. The utility of pyroptosis-related risk score was confirmed by the significant survival difference in TCGA-SARC cohort. As relevant STS dataset in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was extremely limited, there was no OS status recorded in GSE30929, and only DFS status were available. However, to our surprise, this pyroptosis-related risk score was also significantly efficient to predict the DFS of GSE30929 cohort for external validation.
