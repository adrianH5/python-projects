Synapse defective protein 1 homolog 2 encoded by the SYDE2 gene is a Rho GTPase-activating protein whose functional tumorigenic significance is still unclear. Recent pan-cancer analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data showed the potential tumor-suppressing effects of SYDE2 in ccRCC. Subsequently, the TCGA, GTEx data, and human protein atlas were employed to assess the correlation between the SYDE2 expression, clinical data, and overall survival (OS) in ccRCC patients. Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contributing to SYDE2 down expression were identified by expression, relationship, and survival analysis. Eventually, two novel lncRNAs, AL162377.1 and AF111167.2, targeting the miR-21-5p axis, were identified in the SYDE2 upstream non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)-related pathway in ccRCC. The expression level of SYDE2 highly depends on the tumor immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression. In summary, these data demonstrated that lncRNAs/miRNAs-mediated down-regulation of SYDE2 is related to the tumor immune infiltration.

Renal cell carcinoma is a heterogeneous tumor, with 75\u201380% being clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Due to increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ccRCC has a poor prognosis. Therefore, tumor resection is the treatment of choice as it may lead to a complete cure. Most ccRCC patients are generally diagnosed in the late stage because of their occult presentation and fast progression. Targeted therapy has been proven to positively influence patients' survival time. However, treatment resistance in long-term use is a significant drawback. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has great potential in treating patients with advanced ccRCC. However, anti- PD-L1 treatment was effective in only 20% of patients, and long-term remission was not achieved in patients who responded well to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The mechanism of ccRCC is characterized by an interrelated network through multifactorial and complex proliferation. It involves a variety of carcinogens and different genetic backgrounds, resulting in changes in tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Consequently, the molecular mechanism of ccRCC progression should be clarified to support the diagnosis and the treatment of ccRCC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2921, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A Rho GTPase-activating protein, synapse defective protein 1 homolog 2 (SYDE2), is encoded by the SYDE2 gene.
