Current discussions search for an equilibrium that ensures sound research ethics, respects the wishes of the donors and ultimately acknowledges the limited capacity of researchers to follow-up on findings.  Although disagreement persists, current dialogue is moving toward the return of analytically valid and clinically significant genetic findings with the potential to impact immediate medical care.  Yet, many WES/WGS and biobanking projects choose not to return results for a variety of reasons,  including the daunting number of results that could potentially be returned to any one individual.  Additionally, in contrast to the return of findings in clinical research where individual participants are known to the research team and reasonable efforts might be made for recontact, much genetic research is conducted using secondary data \u2013 specifically, the anonymized tissue and DNA made available via biobanks and other types of biorepositories \u2013 making recontact more difficult.

Access to clinically actionable results, as well as results that may be inconclusive, difficult to interpret, or of unclear medical significance are desired. Many participants claim the information would be empowering, providing a sense of control and an opportunity to make lifestyle changes, even if the disease were untreatable. In fact, most laypersons maintain that researchers have an obligation to return results based on the principles of reciprocity; additionally, most perceive ownership of any results stemming from the use of their tissue.  Indeed, another study reported that nearly ninety percent (88.8%) of respondents desired the return of hypothetical genetic findings of uncertain clinical significance.

Given that personally identifiable information would be privy to many affiliated research organizations, it would also place donors and FDMs at greater risk of having personal genetic information compromised. It is important to consider how complex and sensitive results might best be conveyed to families. Furthermore, the question as to who should bear the responsibility of communicating genetic results back to the families \u2013 the biobank or its affiliated researchers \u2013 remains open for debate.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 23454, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another consideration is whether results should be delivered directly or mediated through a healthcare provider or genetic counselor. Genetic results are multifaceted, difficult to interpret, often inconclusive, and sometimes wrong. Moreover, because GTEx would only in some cases be returning the results of a blood relative, the results would be indirect and may not necessarily reflect the actual genetic makeup of the donor\u2019s family, meaning greater interpretation would be required. Genetic counseling and, if necessary, follow-up care would incur substantial costs, and it is unclear who would create, support, and financially back such a system. One solution would be the creation of a decision support tool for FDMs to use when determining what, if any, results they would like returned. Clinically actionable results could be sent from the biobank directly to family physicians. If basic health insurance covered genetic counseling, the results could be disseminated to families and patients in a meaningful manner without placing additional burden on limited research resources. Another potential model to address the return of genetic results to future FDMs would be to assign the primary responsibility of genetic counseling and follow-up care to the biobank, but require researchers using the biobank\u2019s tissue and data to contribute financially to these activities. This model would prohibit affiliated researchers from accessing patient and family identities, establish a single standard for communicating results, and ultimately ensure better data security standards around donor and family re-contact. All these models assume that the index family member will communicate with the rest of the family.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 25175, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The GTEx biobank is currently neither staffed nor funded to meet the demands of returning genetic results, and will unlikely be staffed to perform this task in the future.

It is also possible that, for whatever reason, these groups had greater expectations regarding their receipt of the donor\u2019s genetic results.
