The samples  are fed through an encoder that computes low-dimensional representations  for each metagene . A metagene is a latent, low-dimensional representation that captures certain gene expression patterns of the high-dimensional input sample. These representations are then used as hyperedge features in a message passing neural network that operates on a hypergraph. In the hypergraph representation, each hyperedge labelled with  connects an individual  with metagene  and tissue  if tissue  was collected for individual , i.e. . Through message passing, HYFA learns factorised representations of individual, tissue, and metagene nodes. To infer the gene expression of an uncollected tissue  of individual , the corresponding factorised representations are fed through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that predicts low-dimensional features  for each metagene .
