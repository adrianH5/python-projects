By analyzing several bioactivity repositories, we discovered differences in compound and target coverage advocating the combined use of data from multiple sources. Using data from ChEMBL, PubChem, IUPHAR/BPS, BindingDB, and Probes & Drugs, we assembled a consensus dataset focusing on small molecules with bioactivity on human macromolecular targets. This allowed an improved coverage of compound space and targets, and an automated comparison and curation of structural and bioactivity data to reveal potentially erroneous entries and increase confidence.

Among these are large generic databases such as ChEMBL and PubChem, which include \u201cany\u201d reported molecule and associated data, as well as specialized repositories focusing on extensively profiled \u201chigh-quality\u201d compounds (BindingDB, IUPHAR/BPS, Probes & Drugs, Drugbank). Such repositories are exceptionally valuable for medicinal chemistry, computer-aided drug design, pharmacology, and chemical biology. Since these databases have different objectives, their main focus, the contained data, the ways of data collection, and the level of details are diverse. The use of all available data is indispensable in some data-driven applications in life-science research and computer-aided drug design. Thus, a database that combines all publicly available information on compounds and their bioactivities would be valuable. For example, the assembly of a chemogenomics library containing the most active and selective compounds for hundreds of targets ought to rely on all available bioactivity information to capture potency and selectivity. Moreover, data-driven drug design techniques, e.g., machine learning, relying mainly on ChEMBL or PubChem would profit from larger datasets that combine data from multiple repositories. Furthermore, data quality is another essential factor in decision-making regarding the use of public databases. Combining information from multiple databases not only increases coverage of compound/bioactivity data, but may potentially reveal erroneous structural and activity data in a database when comparing values from different sources, which thereby helps curating data in a semi-automatic fashion. Following these considerations, we have analyzed the overlap and gaps between several public databases of compound/bioactivity data and assembled a consensus database for chemogenomic compound search and machine learning applications. For rapid application, this database only contains information on chemical structure, biological target(s), and bioactivity/potency. Moreover, the database follows a common gene/target nomenclature and minimizes duplicate compound entries for different assays and targets. To add additional validation/confidence, it employs and compares structural and bioactivity information from various repositories.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3524, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

To compile such a set, we gathered the entire public databases, which were provided in different formats, and fed them into the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). The datasets from different sources were then prepared for merging by unifying the data format, standardizing target names according to the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), flagging assay types (cell-based, cell-free, functional, and unspecified) by keywords, and converting molar activity/affinity values to a negative decadic logarithm format where possible. Only molecules with a molecular weight below 1500 and bioactivity on a target of the organism homo sapiens were considered. After this pre-processing, the records of each database were grouped based on their compound IDs (ChEMBL ID or PubChem CID). Structural information (e.g., SMILES) was not used for merging to enable a structure check for the grouped compound entries. After grouping by compound IDs, information on targets, activity types, and assay types was grouped to provide an overview of the activity values for each compound\u2013target pair. Activities for the same compound on different targets were retrieved for 2.9% of the contained compounds and were kept separate. This small fraction of compounds occurring in more than one line (as different compound\u2013target pairs) indicated that the number of true duplicates\u2014if any\u2014was very small. Bioactivities referring to the same compound\u2013target pair were grouped and compared. For multiple annotated bioactivities for a compound\u2013target pair within one log unit difference (e.g., <10-fold), their mean was calculated and kept together with the number of the underlying values. When the difference was more than one log unit, each annotated bioactivity was kept separately in multiple columns. The databases were then merged into a consensus dataset by aggregating compound/bioactivity data based on compound IDs (ChEMBL ID, PubChem CID), gene symbols, activity type, assay type and unit. After this, a bioactivity check was performed by comparing values from the different sources and adding an activity check annotation to provide automated activity validation for additional confidence. In addition, we performed a molecular structure check and compared the structural information stored in the databases after harmonization of structural information from different sources.

The flags in the bioactivity check should therefore be treated with some care and manually examined in cases where precise bioactivity data matter. Another limitation may arise from using compound IDs for matching.

The increased chemical and bioactivity coverage of the consensus dataset may improve robustness of such models compared to the single source databases.
