Therefore, it is extremely important to apply efficient and low-cost methods capable of selecting the best therapeutic targets to speed up the development of new therapies against those diseases. Thus, we propose the use of integrated computational methods capable of evaluating the druggability of the predicted proteomes of Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania infantum, species responsible for the different clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis in Brazil. The protein members of those proteomes were assessed based on their structural, chemical, and functional contexts applying methods that integrate data on molecular function, biological processes, subcellular localization, drug binding sites, druggability, and gene expression. These data were compared to those extracted from already known drug targets (BindingDB targets), which made it possible to evaluate Leishmania proteomes for their biological relevance and treatability. Through this methodology, we identified more than 100 proteins of each Leishmania species with druggability characteristics, and potential interaction with available drugs. Among those, 31 and 37 proteins of L. braziliensis and L. infantum, respectively, have never been tested as drug targets, and they have shown evidence of gene expression in the evolutionary stage of pharmacological interest. Also, some of those Leishmania targets showed an alignment similarity of <50% when compared to the human proteome, making these proteins pharmacologically attractive, as they present a reduced risk of side effects. The methodology used in this study also allowed the evaluation of opportunities for the repurposing of compounds as anti-leishmaniasis drugs, inferring potential interaction between Leishmania proteins and ~1,000 compounds, of which only 15 have already been tested as a treatment for leishmaniasis. Besides, a list of potential Leishmania targets to be tested using drugs described at BindingDB, such as the potential interaction of the DEAD box RNA helicase, TRYR, and PEPCK proteins with the Staurosporine compound, was made available to the public.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2362, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2375, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Leishmaniasis is a set of diseases caused by flagellated protozoa of the genus Leishmania, which can infect mammals since the Mesozoic era (Akhoundi et al.,).

Also, those parasites have a wide range of hosts, including canids, rodents, and humans (Maroli et al.,). Currently, with an estimated 1.3 million annual cases and 350 million people at risk of contracting the diseases, leishmaniasis is the cause of more than 20,000 deaths per year and remains a global public health problem (World Health Organization/Country Office for India,; Gradoni,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3043, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations used to treat leishmaniasis are dependent on geographic region, as treatment failures are related to host genetics, their nutritional states, and to the selection of resistant strains and species present in certain regions. In general, the treatment involves pentavalent antimony, amphotericin B, paromomycin, pentamidine, and miltefosine, which are used in single drug or combined treatments. However, most of these drugs have unavoidable and sometimes irreversible side effects, such as pentamidine, which can cause insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (World Health Organization,; Nagle et al.,). The high incidence of these side effects has led to patients abandoning treatment or using the drugs incorrectly, causing the selection of resistant parasites (Ghorbani and Farhoudi,). Drugs with milder side effects, such as miltefosine, have other downsides such as the long half-life that results in an extensive drug accumulation in the body and the teratogenic effects observed even when applied in dosages below the therapeutic dose (Dorlo et al.,; Rahman et al.,). In addition, other points that should be considered regarding the use of miltefosine as the main treatment are the high frequency of drug resistance, low availability and high cost, incompatible with poor endemic areas (Sunyoto et al.,).

This knowledge about the target, different from what occurs in the phenotypic screening method, allows access to crucial information for the optimization of compounds, such as knowledge about the target/drug binding site (Gilbert,; Li and Kang,).

Evaluating the predicted GO terms for those 68 selected proteins, it was noticeable that we identified proteins related to functions already well-described and used by the pharmaceutical industry, such as those with kinase activity (Supplementary Material 1), a class of proteins that has already been used as drug targets for inflammatory, autoimmune diseases and cancer (Cohen,; Cohen and Alessi,; Patterson et al.,; Bhullar et al.,). This finding is consistent with the literature since that class of proteins has also been indicated as possible drug targets for the treatment of leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani and Leishmania mexicana (Ali et al.,; Rachidi et al.,; Catta-Preta and Mottram,; Raj et al.,). The potential of neutralizing proteins of that class has also been demonstrated by the use of the kinase inhibitor Trametinib for amastigotes and promastigotes of L. braziliensis and L infantum (Borba et al.,). The same observation can be noted to targets with hydrolase activity and ATP-binding, classes of proteins that have been highlighted as potential targets (Cravatt and Lichtman,; Chen et al.,; Soni et al.,), and also reported as a potential drug target in L. infantum (Ch\u00e1vez-Fumagalli et al.,; Sales et al.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47295, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among the 68 potential targets it is possible to find proteins in both species that are potentially essential, but which are not currently widely explored as drug targets in Leishmania species, such as coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (LbrM.06.1260, LinJ.06.1330) and vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4 (LbrM.29.2470, LinJ.29.2610). This fact may be associated with the high similarity of these proteins with their orthologs in the human proteome. However, proteins such as small g-protein (LbrM.35.6570, LinJ.36.6510), which in our results were inferred as potential drug targets in both species, do not show high similarity with orthologs in humans, but remain unexplored as drug targets.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47995, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The applied methodology also allowed to identify proteins that until recently (in the version of the genome used in the study) were noted as hypothetical proteins, namely Major Facilitator Superfamily (LinJ.17.1550), Dephospho-CoA kinase (LinJ.18.0290), PPR repeat/Pentatricopeptide repeat domain/PPR repeat family (LinJ.36.5040), all with putative annotation; A fact that is repeated throughout the list, since among the 68 potential targets, 45 have putative annotation, thus showing that important proteins of the leishmanias druggable proteome still need further studies that reveal the full potential of these proteins to be exploited as targets drugs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48653, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Combining the results of similarity matrices with gene expression and the protein interaction networks allowed the identification of 7 and 9 essential proteins for the amastigote evolutionary stage in L. braziliensis and L. infantum.

In our results, these proteins were similar to 10 drug targets of BindingDB according to the established criteria, thus we were able to infer the potential interactions, among these we had the already mentioned Staurosporine and Sunitinib, the protein kinase inhibitor Sorafenib and the antibiotic Novobiocin, both with antileishmanial activity already identified in experimental methods (Singh et al.,; Sanderson et al.,). Despite not having a low similarity with the human proteome, being highly conserved proteins, they can be inferred as potential drug targets, since when inactivated they result in an inability to differentiate into axenic amastigotes, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial fragmentation, and cell death (Padmanabhan et al.,; Pandey et al.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50175, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The analysis of similarity against the human proteome allowed to verify the possibility of side effects, prioritizing the targets of Leishmania spp. most different from the human proteome.

Evaluating the list of potential targets, it was possible to identify orthologs between the species covered in this work, showing the possibility of redirecting a drug with the potential to act in different parasite species. Among these compounds inferred as antileishmanial in our results are compounds already widely known, such as the general proteinase inhibitor Pepstatin A (BindingDB ID 912) and compounds poorly associated with a potential leishmanicide, such as C20H22N8O5 (BindingDB ID 18046), Gossypol (BindingDB ID 46555) and Bosutinibe chemotherapy (BindingDB ID 4552).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 51387, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In both Leishmania species studied, GPDH proteins (LbrM.10.0640 and LinJ.10.0560) were identified as central proteins in the PIN and potential drug targets, a fact that is compatible with literature data (Suresh et al.,; Ogungbe and Setzer,; Passalacqua et al.,) since such proteins are essential for parasite survival, and present structural characteristics consistent with the requirements for intelligent drug design (Cruz et al.,; da Silva et al.,; Belluti et al.,; Costa et al.,), being drug targets already studied in other trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma cruzi (Leite et al.,; Maluf et al.,) and Trypanosoma brucei (Haanstra et al.,). In addition to having a key role in the glycolytic pathway that is related to the energy production of the parasite (Naderer et al.,; Zhao et al.,), those proteins participate indirectly in the pentose phosphate pathway, therefore they are related to the maintenance of the disease state, since that pathway represents an important process to parasitic defense against reactive oxygen species produced by hosts (Maugeri et al.,; Costa et al.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52478, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Costa et al. also reported GPDHs as potential drug targets describing regions of the proteins, which are essential for their molecular function in parasites, however, those segments are not conserved compared to mammalian species, highlighting the importance of these regions for drug development, a result that is also consistent with the data presented by Haanstra et al., who describes GPDH inhibitors in T. brucei that result in the death of trypanosomes without injury to host cells (Haanstra et al.,). In our results, those proteins were inferred as potential targets for more than 50 drugs, including Methotrexate, Pyrimethamine, and Quinoline compounds. Methotrexate shows an antileishmanial effect with a significant decrease in the average infection rate when associated with meglumine antimoniate (Mahmoudvand et al.,). However, the main use of this drug is currently related to the investigation of metabolic pathways in Leishmania species due to its inhibition function of folate metabolic pathways (Vickers and Beverley,). The pyrimethamine has been evaluated for decades regarding its activity in leishmaniasis, and an antileishmanial effect has already been reported when in its combined forms (Neal,; Serban,). Quinoline compounds have already shown potent antileishmanial activity in vitro and in vivo, thus different formulations of these compounds have been tested as a treatment for leishmaniasis, due to their high efficiency when compared to the standard drug pentamidine, and due to the absence of toxicity to mammalian cells in the concentrations necessary for leishmanicidal action (Sahu et al.,; Tempone et al.,; Gopinath et al.,; Upadhyay et al.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 54155, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Alcohol dehydrogenase proteins have been associated with miltefosine resistance in Leishmania parasites, as they are also involved with the reduction of reactive oxygen species and protection against oxidative stress (Carnielli et al.,; Hefnawy et al.,).
