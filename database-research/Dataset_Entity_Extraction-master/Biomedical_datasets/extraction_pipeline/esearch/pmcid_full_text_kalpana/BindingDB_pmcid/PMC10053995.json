It is well known that the endocannabinoid system inhibits the pathogenesis of the inflammatory and autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To the best of our knowledge, no research has been done that explains the network-pharmacology-based anti-rheumatic processes by focusing on the endocannabinoid system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further our understanding of the signaling pathways, associated proteins, and genes underlying RA based on the abundant natural endocannabinoids. The knowledge on how the phytocannabinoids in Cannabis sativa affect the endocannabinoid system was gathered from the literature. SwissTarget prediction and BindingDB databases were used to anticipate the targets for the phytocannabinoids. The genes related to RA were retrieved from the DisGeNET and GeneCards databases. Protein\u2013protein interactions (high confidence > 0.7) were carried out with the aid of the string web server and displayed using Cytoscape. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway analysis was used to perform enrichment analyses on the endocannabinoid\u2013RA common targets. ShinyGO 0.76 was used to predict the biological processes listed in the Gene Ontology (GO) classification system. The binding affinity between the ligand and the receptors was precisely understood using molecular docking, induced-fit docking, and a molecular dynamics simulation. The network pharmacology analyses predicted that processes like response to oxygen-containing compounds and peptodyl-amino acid modification are related to the potential mechanisms of treatment for RA. These biological actions are coordinated by cancer, neuroactive ligand\u2013receptor interaction, lipids and atherosclerosis, the calcium signaling pathway, and the Rap1 signaling pathway. According to the results of molecular docking, in the context of RA, phytocannabinoids may bind to important target proteins such PIK3CA, AKT1, MAPK9, PRKCD, BRAF, IGF1R, and NOS3.

Specific soluble pro-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines or chemokines, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, are produced as a result of an inflammatory reaction. Many acute and chronic disorders are made worse by persistent inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is just one of the many chronic inflammatory disorders that continues to be a major global health issue. One to two percent of the world\u2019s population suffers from the chronic inflammatory disease known as arthritis. It is characterized by immune-mediated inflammatory sinusitis, which causes hyperplasia, vasculogenesis, pannus formation, cartilage and bone destruction, joint malformation, and functional impairment. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used to treat the unpleasant inflammatory diseases, either systemically or by applying topical versions locally. The most prevalent side effects of systemic medications, notwithstanding their effectiveness, are gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcers, whereas topical medications simply treat symptoms and do not cure the condition. Therefore, it is necessary to research and validate plant-based/herbal anti-inflammatory drugs from traditional and complementary systems of medicine that have been used clinically for decades and are thought to be safe with few to no side effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3968, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The endocannabinoid system consists of the numerous phytocannabinoids derived from Cannabis sativa (family: Cannabaceae) as well as cannabinoid receptors and enzymes that aid in several steps to exhibit any pharmacological activity. It is well known that the endocannabinoid system inhibits the pathogenesis of the inflammatory and autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis. For ages, people have used Cannabis sativa (family: Cannabaceae) as a traditional medication for entheogenic and recreational uses. Cannabis sativa, however, may be useful in the treatment of pain, dysmenorrhea, muscle spasms, anorexia, etc., according to earlier research. Recently, the tale of these illegal narcotics being used as herbal medicine has grown increasingly intriguing. California and various countries have allowed the use of chemotherapy-diversified phytocannabinoids due to their medical benefits. Furthermore, Canada approved the use of phytocannabinoids for medical and recreational uses in the years 1999 and 2018, respectively. Cannabinoids consist of several phytocannabinoids derived from Cannabis sativa. The most prevalent components that have psychoactive properties are tetrahydrocannabinoids (THC). For a long time, isoprenylated resorcinyl polypeptides known as cannabinoids have been utilized as medicines. Previous research established that various phytocannabinoids target the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), transient receptor potential ion channels, and protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). The anti-arthritic properties of phytocannabinoids are due to their effects on the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. However, the phytocannabinoids\u2019 therapeutic situation is far more complicated and involves several targets. The presence of a dibenzopyran ring with a hydrophobic alkyl chain is a typical structural characteristic of the identified phytocannabinoids.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5882, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "RA is a condition with several diagnoses that is primarily characterized by chronic synovial inflammation. The etiology of this illness involves the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the growth of synoviocytes that resemble fibroblasts, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases. These substances encourage angiogenesis and osteoclast activity, which damage joints by altering the development of bone and cartilage. The endocannabinoid system negatively controls immunological reactions and inflammation associated with RA. Negative side effects could result from continued use of these drugs. The endocannabinoid system is a viable pharmacological target for the treatment of RA, hence the treatment with such medications needs to be clarified. The network pharmacology technique offers a platform for predicting the molecular mechanisms of the multi-components present in traditional herbal formulations. Selective molecules may have poorer clinical effectiveness than multi-target medications due to phenotypic resilience and network topology. Many herbal formulations have been analyzed for the probable mechanism in a disease through this approach. Therefore, using combined bioinformatics and network pharmacology methodologies, the goal of this study is to further understand the signaling pathways, associated proteins, and genes that cause rheumatoid arthritis based on the plentiful naturally occurring phytocannabinoids.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7350, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

Many phytocannabinoids, cannabinoid receptors, and enzymes that are part of the endocannabinoid system all contribute to the pharmacological activity of cannabis in different ways. It is well known that the endocannabinoid system inhibits the pathogenesis of the inflammatory and autoimmune disease RA. Due to the abundance of natural phytocannabinoids, the goal of this study was to build on the signaling pathways, associated proteins, and genes that cause RA using integrated bioinformatics and network pharmacology.

In cancer, there is an abnormality in the signaling of PI3K/Akt/mTOR due to which many types of research have been done to find the inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling which may act as anticancer agents. RA is an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disease where the abnormal proliferation of immune cells, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and synovial fibroblasts may significantly overlap with the abnormal growth of cancer cells. The results of some recent studies in arthritis using PI3K signaling inhibitors suggest that small molecule inhibitor strategies directed at PI3K signaling may be useful for immune-mediated arthritis. The present study predicted that PIK3CA and AKT are the most common genes found in the top pathways of phytocannabinoids to combat arthritis. A previous study suggested that phytocannabinoids are responsible for the regulation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 in the brain. Hence, PI3K and AKT may be the target of phytocannabinoids in RA. A previous study revealed that MAPK9 causes an increase in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, inflammatory response, facilitates apoptosis in RA patients, and promotes the progression of fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Protein kinase C like PRKCD is known to have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like RA. The current study suggested the involvement of MAPK and the protein kinase C pathway in combating arthritis by phytocannabinoids. Previous in vitro studies in cell lines reveal that phytocannabinoids cause cytotoxicity in leukemic cells through the MAPK pathway. The cannabinoid receptor 2 also has an inhibitory role in synovial fibroblasts in RA through protein kinase. These results support our current findings. The BRAF gene was found to transform the rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts and lead to the destruction of articular cartilage and bone in RA. Previous studies revealed that IGF-1R signaling leads to inflammation in RA due to the formation of various cytokines like IL-6 and activation of T cells. A previous study revealed that cannabinoid receptors promote the chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced breast cancer metastasis via IGF-1R/AKT/GSK-3\u03b2. It indicates that phytocannabinoids may ameliorate RA through cannabinoid-receptor-induced IGF-1R and AKT. There is a common link of pathogenesis of RA and atherosclerosis. Patients with RA are at approximately 1.5-fold risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with the general population. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6, involved in the pathogenesis of RA, are also independently predictive of subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD). In RA, inflammation alters HDL constituents and the concentration of LDL and HDL, thus facilitating atherosclerosis and CVD events. On the other hand, the increase of oxidative processes, frequently observed in RA, also induces atherosclerosis. Cannabinoids were reported to cause a decrease in inflammation during atherosclerosis which correlates with the current findings. A previous study reported that the alterations in calcium signaling may cause the functional T cell abnormalities associated with RA. The RAP signaling pathway is also responsible for the occurrence of RA. RAP1 is deregulated in T lymphocytes, which leads to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which promotes the hyporesponsiveness of synovial T lymphocytes, leading to inflammation. A previous study revealed that the cannabinoid receptor (CB1) causes neurite outgrowth through the Rap1 pathway. This indicates that phytocannabinoids may alter the RAP1 pathway through the cannabinoid receptor (CB1). Nitric oxide is produced by nitric oxide synthetase (NOS). Important cytokines produced in RA are IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1, which stimulate NOS in inflammatory cells and increase the production of nitric oxides. There is an increase in nitric oxide levels in arthritis, as shown in preclinical and clinical studies. A previous study reported that phytocannabinoids may prevent RA conditions by decreasing nitric oxide levels and cytokines which supports the current findings.

These proteins were further subjected to molecular docking with phytocannabinoids. Negative binding energy indicates effective binding to the target. Lower binding energy suggests a stable ligand\u2013receptor complex better explained as <\u22125 kcal/mol called good binding activity and <\u22127 kcal/mol called strong binding activity. Except for AKT1 and PRKCD, the Glidescores of the top three compounds against the other five proteins were in the range of \u22128.888 to \u22126.751 kcal/mol. The top three active ingredients were shown to have a strong binding interaction with their respective proteins. It entails unexpected bias from the materiality, which could hasten the anonymous fallacy in in vitro or in vivo studies. However, the results of the molecular docking experiment suggest the potential therapeutic approaches and could guide trials in animals. Network pharmacology is currently used extensively for various traditional medicines, such as Indian traditional medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Kampo, traditional Korean medicine, etc. Network pharmacology research is being conducted owing to its robust potential to investigate convoluted relationships among multiple targets. Additionally, network pharmacology accelerates the modernization of the Indian traditional system of medicine by usefully illuminating the synergistic effects of biochemical and systemic biology methodologies. Researchers may identify prospective active ingredients for upcoming in vitro and in vivo studies by using molecular docking to lay out an effective binding mode of the active ingredients with disease-related important target proteins. However, a number of the Ayurvedic formula\u2019s constituents can have antagonistic and synergistic effects on the body while being treated because they target the same protein. It is important to consider these implications and to continue to assess them. The findings of MM-GBSA (binding free energy) and IFD support the molecular dynamics findings that the ligand is stable within the protein. One of the finest molecular dynamics results was obtained with the Akt1-cannabitriol complex, despite its Glidescore of \u22126.035 kcal/mol.
