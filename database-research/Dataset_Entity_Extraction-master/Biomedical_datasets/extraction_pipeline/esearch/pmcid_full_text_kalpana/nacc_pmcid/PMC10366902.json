Thanks to new PET imaging techniques, it is possible to map the spread of tau in different brain regions of living subjects. In vivo observations in these imaging studies have been shown to have significant compatibility with classic Braak staging. Since the advent of CSF biomarkers, molecular neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evaluations, four distinct subtypes have emerged: limbic-predominant, medial temporal lobe (MTL)-sparing, posterior, and lateral temporal. These subtypes are based on in vivo tau deposition and have a strong correlation between corticolimbic network involvement and expected clinical presentation and progression. The limbic subtype most closely resembles the classical amnestic predominant presentation and progression of AD. On average, patients with the limbic subtype have worse delayed-recall memory but initially perform better across other cognitive domains compared to other subtypes. Tau progression in the limbic subtype starts in the entorhinal cortex and follows the typical pattern noted by the Braak staging scheme. This group is also more likely to include APOE4 carriers and have an older age of onset. Patients with the MTL-sparing subtype tend to be younger at onset, with an overall higher tau burden in the frontoparietal networks and more prominent deficits in executive function and working memory. New reports demonstrate evidence of neuropathologic findings seen in the MTL-sparing subtype showing a possible different pathway of pTAU pathology that first involves parietal cortex, followed by limbic structures. The posterior subtype shows prominent deficits in visuospatial functions and corresponds with the clinical phenotype of posterior cortical atrophy. Finally, the lateral temporal subtype, particularly when lateralized to the dominant hemisphere, is characterized by more prominent language involvement and corresponds with the clinical phenotype of logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia.
