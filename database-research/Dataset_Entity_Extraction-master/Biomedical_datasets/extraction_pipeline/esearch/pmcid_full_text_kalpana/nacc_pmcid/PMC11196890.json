Sleep disturbances, as measured in various ways, in other disorders are associated with higher risks of earlier mortality; some examples are heightened cardiovascular deaths in older adults, excessive mortality with untreated sleep apnea,   and shift work.

This extends earlier findings that the presence of sleep disturbances is associated with worsening cognitive status over time,   and mortality.   Our study also supports the findings of other studies that evaluated mortality risks as functions of accumulated symptoms determined through the NPQ-I using dementia registries.   In one study, participants were gathered into NPQ-I score groups, and mortality risk increased stepwise by the increasing severity of the group. Similarly, our findings demonstrated increasing mortality risks with the NPIweight. This highlights our unique contribution as we examined the risk of sleep disturbances independently from the other symptoms accounted for in the NPI-Q. Another important recent study that specifically evaluated sleep and mortality in dementia was an evaluation of the National Health and Aging Trends cohort.   In this study, participants were asked if difficulties initiating or falling asleep occurred on \u201cmost nights\u201d or \u201cevery night.\u201d Similar to our findings, sleep disturbances were associated with early mortality. Although that study controlled for demographic factors and \u201cchronic conditions,\u201d we explicitly controlled for other neuropsychiatric symptoms, demographic factors, and chronic conditions. High NPI-Q scores and more severe NPS have been shown to increase mortality risk in both MCI and dementia.   Although previous studies have focused on NPS symptoms or conditions, such as depression, we chose to focus on the NPI-Q \u201csleep behaviors\u201d as we found that it is closely associated with biomarkers of dementia such as biomarkers of hippocampal volumetry and cerebral spinal fluid phosphorylated tau:beta amyloid ratios.   Our study is unique in that the effect of sleep disturbances is examined in isolation from and with other known NPS in dementia and across multiple levels of cognitive status. Considering the known relationship between sleep and cognitive health, our findings were not surprising; however, results that showed a greater deleterious impact of sleep disturbances at better levels of cognitive status should be explored further, especially in the context of precision medicine and early intervention for at-risk individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27527, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous work has also focused on neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) clusters using the NPI-Q at different stages of the disease process.   In a recent systematic review, greater severity of NPS overall predicted both cognitive decline and mortality, but when symptoms were considered individually, only isolation, agitation/aggression, hallucinations, and depression predicted mortality across 42 prospective cohorts of 24,711 participants.   Only one study in the review considered sleep disturbances as an independent NPS predictor of cognitive decline.   NPI-Q scores are known to predict cognitive decline   and mortality in adults living with cognitive impairment;   however, there are few studies examining the impact of the NACC UDS-\u201csleep disturbances\u201d on cognitive decline and mortality. Previous work demonstrated that in an initial visit presentation with \u201can NPI-Q score greater than zero (endorsement of any symptom[s]), there was a 1.37 times greater risk of conversion to dementia than those with no symptoms of the NPI-Q.  \u201d This study demonstrates that sleep disturbances significantly affect the mortality of cognitively normal older adults independently from the complex dementia-specific symptoms assessed by the NPI-Q score. This is significant as sleep disturbances can be modified, possibly attenuating mortality risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 28874, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Limitations include that our measure of sleep disturbances, the \u201cnighttime behaviors\u201d variable from the NPI-Q, although it correlates with the severity of cognitive impairment and biomarkers of AD,   it is not a clinical index such as the Insomnia Severity Index   or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which are common surveys by which to measure problems with the initiation or maintenance of sleep clinically. Although the NACC UDS provided a large sample size to examine the association between sleep and mortality, the sample\u2019s older age and risk factors may have contributed to a relatively short follow-up period to examine mortality. We acknowledge that MoCA was not created as a diagnostic tool and only approximates a clinical diagnosis; in the present study, we used it as a longitudinal variable to control for cognitive level, which had the advantage of consistency through the database. Although the NACC UDS includes queries on comorbid medical conditions and medications known to impact mortality, we found a significant amount of missing data across some, but not all, known confounders of either death or Alzheimer\u2019s disease (e.g., obesity, sedative-hypnotic medications). Therefore, these variables were excluded from the analysis. Although the NACC UDS is a robust, longitudinal database, participants do not comprise a nationally representative sample due to differing recruitment methods and ADC areas of focus by individual sites. For example, the NACC UDS participants are more likely to be white and highly educated. We collapsed ethnic and racial categories into binomial variables, which may have overlooked nuances among demographic groups. All NPI-Q questions were provided by the co-participant, which may be impacted by whether or not the co-participant is a full-time caregiver, bed partner, or poor sleeper. Additionally, for participants who were not included through death, there is the potential that this lack of data introduced bias that may have impacted our findings. Analyses described that \u201csurvivors\u201d had about a year shorter duration of observation than the deceased, and it is possible that those we labeled as \u201csurvivors\u201d lacked ADC follow-ups rather than the perceived increased survival rate at a non-deceased last ADC visit.
