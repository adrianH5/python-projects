It is possible that frontal lobe atrophy can cause cues in the environment to be misinterpreted, generating illogical conclusions rather than contextually appropriate responses. Loss of frontal volume is also consistent with the theory of hypofrontality, which posits that frontal deficits that lead to poor insight may be an underlying cause of delusions. Poor insight could contribute to the sustainment of these delusions despite contradictory evidence.
