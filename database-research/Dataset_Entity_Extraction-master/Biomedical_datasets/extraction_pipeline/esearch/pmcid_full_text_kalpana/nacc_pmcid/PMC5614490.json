We examined the relationship between history of TBI with loss of consciousness (LOC) history and cognitive change in participants with normal cognition and probable AD, stratified by APOE \u03b54 allele status. The sample included 706 participants (432 with normal cognition; 274 probable AD) from the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset that completed the Uniform Data Set evaluation between 2005 and 2014. Normal and probable AD participants with a history of TBI were matched to an equal number of demographically and clinically similar participants without a TBI history. In this dataset, TBI with LOC was defined as brain trauma with brief or extended unconsciousness.

Similarly, inclusion of in vivo biomarkers of AD (e.g., hippocampal atrophy, PET amyloid imaging) would have provided key insight into the present findings, however, only a subset of NACC ADCs have contributed imaging data and thus inclusion of any imaging variables would also significantly reduce the sample size of the study and limit statistical power. Despite these limitations, our results are consistent with recently published clinical and neuropathological studies that indicate that TBI with LOC is not associated with AD dementia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27377, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we investigated the effect of exposure to TBI with LOC on the rates of cognitive change among normal controls and participants diagnosed with probable AD.
