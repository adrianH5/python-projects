Biological follow-up of genetic results is labour-intensive and expensive. It is therefore important to concentrate such work on the genes that are most important to AD susceptibility. Thus, the rationale for reducing the gene set is that it defines a network of genes that are not only related through co-expression and protein interaction, but also show enrichment for genetic association signal. These genes are therefore strong candidates for future biological study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31462, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Gene Expression", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31478, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We examined mRNA expression of the novel genes PLCG2 and ABI3 in neuropathologically characterized brain post-mortem tissue (508 persons): they are expressed at low levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of subjects from two studies of aging with prospective autopsy (ranked 12,965th out of 13,484 expressed genes). However, ABI3 and PLCG2 were more highly expressed in purified microglia/macrophage from the cortex of 11 subjects from these cohorts (1740th and 2600th respectively out of the 11,500 expressed genes)(unpublished data). These findings are consistent with the high levels of expression of both PLCG2 and ABI3 in peripheral monocytes, spleen, and whole blood reported by the ROADmap project and in microglia as reported by Zhang et al. From the same brain tissue, we examined methylation (n=714) and H3K9ac acetylation (n=676) data and found differential methylation at four CpG sites and lower acetylation at two H3K9ac sites adjacent to PLCG2 and ABI3 in relation to increased global neuritic plaque and tangle burden (FDR < 0.05). Similarly, high TREM2 expression has been shown to correlate with increasing neuritic plaque burden.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32633, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "AMP-AD Gene Expression Data", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32661, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "RNA sequencing was used to measure gene expression levels in the temporal cortex of 80 subjects with pathologically confirmed AD and 76 controls without any neurodegenerative pathologies obtained from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and the Banner Sun Health Institute. The human RNA sequencing data is deposited in the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) knowledge portal housed in Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2580853/wiki/66722). After QC, our postmortem human cohort has 80 subjects with pathologically confirmed AD and 76 controls without any neurodegenerative pathologies. Assuming two samples of 100 per group, two-sample t-test, same standard deviation, we will have 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.40, 0.49 and 0.59 at p<0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively, where effect size is the difference in means between two groups divided by the within-group standard deviation. The human RNA sequencing data overview, QC and analytic methods are available at the following Synapse pages, respectively: syn3163039, syn6126114, syn6090802. Multivariable linear regression was used to test for association of gene expression levels with AD diagnosis (Dx) using two different models: In the Simple model, we adjust for age at death, sex, RNA integrity number (RIN), tissue source, and RNAseq flowcell. In the Comprehensive model, we adjust for all these covariates, and brain cell type markers for five cell-specific genes (CD68 (microglia), CD34 (endothelial), OLIG2 (oligodendroglia), GFAP (astrocyte), ENO2 (neuron)) to account for cell number changes that occur with AD neuropathology. TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are significantly higher in AD temporal cortex prior to correcting for cell types (Simple model), but this significance is abolished after adjusting for cell-specific gene counts (Comprehensive model). This suggests that these elevations are likely a consequence of changes in cell types that occur with AD, most likely microgliosis given that TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are microglia-enriched genes (Supplementary Table 19, Supplementary Figure 12).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34744, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34767, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Competing Financial Interests Statement         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34827, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Robert R.
