Their impact on cognition, however, appears highly variable. Complementing conventional scoring of WMH load (volume and location) by quantitative characterization of the shape irregularity of WMHs might improve the understanding of the relationship between WMH load and cognitive performance. Here we propose the \u201cconfluency sum score\u201d (COSU) as a marker of the total shape irregularity of WMHs in the brain. The study included two independent patient samples: 87 cognitively impaired geriatric inpatients from a prospective neuroimaging study (iDSS) and 198 subjects from the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center (NACC) database (132 with, 66 w/o cognitive impairment). After automatic segmentation and clustering of the WMHs on FLAIR (LST toolbox, SPM8), the confluency of the i-th contiguous WMH cluster was computed as confluencyi = [1/(36\u03c0)\u00b7surfacei3/volumei2]1/3\u20131. The COSU was obtained by summing the confluency over all WMH clusters. COSU was tested for correlation with CERAD-plus subscores. Correlation analysis was restricted to subjects with at least moderate WMH load (\u2265 13.5 ml; iDSS / NACC: n = 52 / 80).

The pathophysiology underlying this finding is unclear. The mechanisms by which WMH lesions affect cognitive function most likely include local damage of nerve fibers. Thus, the stronger association of processing speed and fluid cognitive abilities with COSU than with total WMH volume might be related to the fact that the larger WMH surface associated with larger COSU at the same total WMH volume allows interference with more white matter fasciculi (in an extreme case, a thin WMH \u201cplate\u201d, small volume but large confluency, might interfere with all fasciculi connecting posterior and anterior brain or left and right hemisphere).
