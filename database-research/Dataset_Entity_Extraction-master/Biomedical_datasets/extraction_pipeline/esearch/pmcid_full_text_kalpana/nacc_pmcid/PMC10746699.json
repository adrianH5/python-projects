LATE-NC may mimic Alzheimer disease clinically and often co-occurs with Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). This report focuses on the cognitive effects of isolated and concomitant LATE-NC and ADNC. Cognitive/neuropsychological, neuropathologic, genetic, and demographic variables were analyzed in 28 control, 31 isolated LATE-NC, 244 isolated ADNC, and 172 concurrent LATE-NC/ADNC subjects from the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center. Cases with LATE-NC and ADNC were significantly older than controls; cases with ADNC had a significantly higher proportion of cases with at least one APOE \u03b54 allele. Both LATE-NC and ADNC exhibited deleterious effects on overall cognition proportional to their neuropathological stages; concurrent LATE-NC/ADNC exhibited the worst overall cognitive effect.

Clinically, patients with isolated LATE-NC are more likely to initially present with more normal cognition and develop symptoms more slowly or at an older age than subjects with ADNC, although LATE-NC has also been associated with increased impairment of cognition in subjects with ADNC, LBD, PART, and other neurodegenerative entities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22352, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given that LATE-NC shares some similar morphologic features and a common protein inclusion (TDP-43) with other neurodegenerative diseases, including FTLD-TDP (types A\u2013E) and ALS, there remains debate as to the nature of LATE-NC and its relationship to these other entities. While no accepted set of criteria for the definitive distinction between LATE-NC and FTLD-TDP yet exists, there have been recent recommendations for differentiating between the 2 disorders from a neuropathologic standpoint. TDP-43 in LATE-NC may be similar to FTLD-TDP types A and B, however, it is histomorphologically distinct from types C\u2013E. Moreover, the presence of known pathogenic mutations associated with FTLD-TDP (such as C9orf72 and GRN) are incompatible with a diagnosis of LATE-NC, and an earlier age of onset, high burden of middle frontal gyrus TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions, and TDP-43 inclusions in subcortical structures, the brainstem, or spinal cord should favor a diagnosis of FTLD-TDP and/or ALS. The LATE-NC subjects included in this study were significantly older (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and had better overall cognition at their final clinical encounter (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) than NACC subjects with FTLD-TDP.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23556, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we demonstrate impairment of global cognition and some measurements of logical memory, processing speed, and executive function with progressive LATE-NC stages (Fig.\u00a01), which follows a similar, if less severe, trajectory with progressive ADNC levels (Fig.\u00a02). Similar to previous studies, we found that the combination of ADNC and LATE-NC resulted in further impairment of many of the cognitive and neuropsychological domains assessed. While combined low levels of LATE-NC (Stage 1) and ADNC (Level 1) only caused small impairments detectable in global CDR, the combination of symptomatic LATE-NC (Stages 2\u20133) and symptomatic ADNC (Levels 2\u20133) caused additional impairment in global cognitive measures and a number of the more specific neuropsychological tests. Importantly, LATE-NC stage and ADNC level were each independently associated with cognitive impairment in multivariate logistic regression models; LATE-NC stage appears to contribute less to cognitive impairment than does ADNC level, but there is a significant increase in the likelihood of cognitive impairment with increasing LATE-NC stages and LATE-NC has a clear additive effect when concurrent with ADNC (Fig.\u00a03). The incidence of hippocampal sclerosis was increased in LATE-NC Stages 2\u20133 compared to controls and LATE-NC restricted to the amygdala, although no significant difference was found between Stages 2 and 3. This is in contrast to isolated ADNC (without concurrent LATE-NC) which does not appear to significantly increase the incidence of HS compared to controls, although there is an increased frequency of HS in combined low-level LATE-NC/ADNC pathology compared to controls or either of these low-level findings in isolation. The odds ratio for cognitive impairment in subjects with hippocampal sclerosis was significant in univariate analysis, but no significant effect on cognition was identified when LATE-NC was introduced as a covariate (Fig.\u00a03B, C). These data are congruent with previous findings suggesting that HS is a frequent feature of LATE-NC and that the majority of HS cases have underlying LATE-NC pathology. HS has a significantly deleterious effect on cognition, however, in the current cohort, this effect appears to primarily be in the context of TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions in the hippocampus and/or middle frontal gyrus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25911, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several limitations associated with this study. The first is inherent to the NACC dataset itself, which is likely not representative of the general population. This cohort is enriched for non-Hispanic Caucasian patients, patients of higher socioeconomic status, patients with higher education, patients with rare neurodegenerative diseases and more severe neuropathologic findings and clinical symptoms, and patients with more frequent APOE \u03b54 alleles compared to community-based autopsy cohorts. In addition, there are relatively few cases that could be considered \u201ccontrols\u201d by either cognitive or neuropathologic measures. With regard to LATE-NC and ADNC staging, autopsy data on TDP-43 inclusions and Thal phase were not included in the NACC NP data set until version 10 in 2014, and there is currently no specific \u201cLATE-NC\u201d designation. Therefore, the majority of cases in the NACC dataset could not be assigned a LATE-NC stage and many could not be assigned an official ADNC level. We included only cases with enough neuropathologic information available to assign these scores, which accounted for our relatively low number of subjects compared to the full NACC cohort, particularly in the isolated LATE-NC groups. This makes it impossible to draw meaningful conclusions about the prevalence of LATE-NC in this cohort, may result in some comparisons being underpowered, and may explain why some neuropsychological tests were significant in LATE-NC Stage 2 but not LATE-NC Stage 3. Future research into LATE-NC stage subgroups with larger cohorts should further elucidate differences in neuropsychological profiles in these groups. Additionally, the neuropathologic data available from NACC assess the distribution of pathology in the brain but not the severity of pathology within a brain region, which may be an important factor in predicting cognitive status in some diseases, particularly those with low overall disease burden or occurring at early stages. By necessity, this was a cross-sectional study and as such could not directly measure the cognitive or neuropsychological impact of progressive LATE-NC or ADNC, however, the development of in vivo biomarkers may allow for longitudinal assessment of cognitive function in individuals with isolated and mixed neurodegenerative pathologies in the near future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28254, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Overall, our findings suggest that LATE-NC has significant effects on global cognition and select neuropsychological domains as TDP-43 progresses to the hippocampus (Stage 2) and frontal neocortex (Stage 3).

These data add to the existing knowledge on the clinical consequences of LATE-NC and the growing literature on the effects of multiple concurrent neurodegenerative pathologies.
