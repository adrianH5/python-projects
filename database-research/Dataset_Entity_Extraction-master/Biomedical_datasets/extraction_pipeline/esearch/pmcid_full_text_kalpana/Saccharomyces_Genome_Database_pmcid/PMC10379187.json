They are involved in, amongst other functions, intercellular communication. This article presents studies on EVs produced by the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745. The size distribution and concentration of EVs in the liquid culture of yeast were estimated. Moreover, the vesicles of S. boulardii were tested for their cytotoxicity against three model human intestinal cell lines. This study did not show any significant negative effect of yeast EVs on these cells under tested conditions. In addition, EVs of S. boulardii were verified for their ability to internalize in vitro with human cells and transfer their cargo. The yeast vesicles were loaded with doxorubicin, an anticancer agent, and added to the cellular cultures. Subsequently, microscopic observations revealed that these EVs transferred the compound to human intestinal cell lines. A cytotoxicity test confirmed the activity of the transferred doxorubicin. Detailed information about the proteins present in EVs might be important in terms of exploring yeast EVs as carriers of active molecules. Thus, proteomic analysis of the EV content was also conducted within the present study, and it allowed the identification of 541 proteins after matching them to the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD).

They use these phospholipid structures to communicate with other cells, respond to changes in the surrounding environment, or obtain food. From research on pathogenic microscopic fungi\u2014mainly Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans\u2014it is known that these microorganisms, after infecting the human body, secrete EVs that are necessary for effective host colonization. Since 2007, when C. neoformans was proven to secrete EVs into the environment, similar studies have been published for 25 other yeast species, mostly pathogenic. Reports show that yeast EVs, similar to the best-known mammalian EVs, are membrane vesicles with sizes mainly in the range of 20\u2013400 nm. In addition to proteins, they contain other molecules, e.g., miRNA or mRNA, and are most likely responsible for communication between different cells in the environment. However, much more research is required to understand both the factors determining the charge composition of EVs and the mechanisms of their secretion by yeast. Furthermore, it is also unknown how yeast EVs interact with other cells, whether human, animal, or plant. This is because extracellular vesicles are not a homogeneous group of molecules and have sizes on the order of nanometers; so, their isolation and study is a challenge.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3175, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Knowledge about the EVs produced by GRAS (generally recognized as safe) yeast present in fermented food is even more limited than that of pathogenic fungi. To date, there have been publications showing that the classic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or so-called unconventional wine-making yeasts such as Torulaspora delbrueckii or Metschnikowia pulcherrima secrete extracellular membrane vesicles containing a variety of proteins. Therefore, it can be assumed that EV production and secretion among different yeast species are common, although this needs to be verified experimentally. We are convinced that probiotic microorganisms should be included in this kind of research because they are increasingly used as a dietary supplement.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3913, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Probiotics have a well-established positive effect on the functioning of our body by stabilizing the autochthonous microbiome, protecting against colonization by pathogens, and secreting enzymes that help digest food as well as substances that stimulate the host\u2019s immune system. Lactic acid bacteria are mainly among them; however, yeasts, e.g., from the genera Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces, are also present. To date, the best documented probiotic effectiveness in clinical trials has been shown by the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745. This raises the question of whether the probiotic activity of the microorganisms we consume with food or dietary supplements is related to the EVs they secrete. In the case of lactic acid bacteria, recent reports indicate that such a correlation is possible. Notably, in 2022, one publication showed that EVs released by S. cerevisiae activated the immune response of mouse macrophage-like and dendritic cells. Since S. boulardii is morphologically and physiologically remarkably similar to S. cerevisiae and has recently been recognized as its subspecies by some microbiologists, its EVs may likely act similarly. However, this needs to be confirmed by research. Moreover, it would be interesting to study whether probiotic yeast can transfer proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules via EVs into human gastrointestinal cells and exert any influence on their metabolic activity. Assuming that such a hypothesis is true, in the future, it would be possible to create genetically modified probiotic yeast strains that would secrete in the intestinal tracts, for example, recombinant proteins with therapeutic or immunizing effects in the vesicles. This study aimed to verify whether EVs of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 can be considered drug carriers. The research was divided into three main tasks: (1) isolation and morphological and proteomic characterization of EVs from yeast cultures; (2) study of changes in the metabolic activity of model human intestinal cell lines in the presence of yeast EVs; and (3) investigation of whether EVs are able to effectively transfer their cargo to human cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6069, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

Therefore, yeast cultures were grown in standard YPD liquid medium; then, suspensions of EVs in PBS were obtained using sequential centrifugation, filtration, and ultrafiltration. The size and concentration of EVs in the samples were determined using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). NTA revealed that most of the nanoparticles were in the size range between 30 and 230 nm with a mean value of 127.39 \u00b1 1.34 nm (Figure 1a). Similarly, it has been recently reported for S. cerevisiae that it produced EVs with sizes between 25 and 250 nm. Nevertheless, it should be noted that one of the first steps in the purification of EVs was the removal of yeast cells by routine filtration on a membrane with 0.2 \u00b5m pores, which significantly eliminated particles larger than 200 nm from the purified mixture. Therefore, it cannot be completely ruled out that the CNCM I-745 strain also secretes bigger EVs. Based on the number of EVs in the samples assessed via NTA (8.20 \u00b1 1.12 \u00d7 1010 EVs/mL), an EV concentration of 5.49 \u00d7 109 EVs/mL in the 150 mL cultures of S. boulardii in YPD medium was calculated. For comparison, the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans produced 6.10 \u00d7 108 EVs/mL of minimal YNB (yeast nitrogen based with 2% glucose) culture medium. Furthermore, by knowing the number of viable cells in the cultures of S. boulardii (1 \u00d7 108 cfu/mL), it was also possible to determine that a single yeast cell released approximately 55 EVs. A similar number of 44 EVs per cell was recently reported for the pathogenic yeast Candida tropicalis. No such data were found for S. cerevisiae.

However, the second tumor line HCT116 significantly increased (31%) ROS secretion only in the presence of the highest EV concentration. It has frequently been reported that, although isolated from colorectal cancer, the two cell lines HT-29 and HCT116 show some phenotypic differences. For instance, HCT116 is a highly aggressive cell line that shows no ability to differentiate, while HT-29 has an intermediate capacity to differentiate. Thus, it is not surprising that the two tumor lines may react slightly differently to the presence of yeast EVs.
