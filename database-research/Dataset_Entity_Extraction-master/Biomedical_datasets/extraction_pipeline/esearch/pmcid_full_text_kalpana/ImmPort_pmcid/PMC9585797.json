This study aimed to identify potential immune-related biomarkers, pathways, and the potential regulatory networks underlying CHD. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CHD and control samples were determined by analyzing GSE71226 and GSE9128. The overlapping differential expression immune-related genes (DE-IRGs) for CHD were identified by analyzing the ImmPort database and two GEO databases. A total of 384 DE-IRGs were identified. Subsequently, comprehensive enrichment analyses suggested that DE-IRGs were enriched in immune-related pathways, including autoimmune thyroid disease, the intestinal immune network for IGA production, and downstream signaling events of B cell receptors. The signature of DE-IRGs was validated using an external independent dataset GSE20681 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.875). Furthermore, we conducted protein\u2013protein interaction network analysis and identified eight hub genes, which were most enriched in regulation of defense response, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, regulation of JNK cascade, and regulation of cytokine production. Moreover, networks of miRNAs-mRNAs and transcription factors (TFs)-mRNA underlying the integrated data were established, involving eight miRNAs and 76 TF-targeting hub genes. Ultimately, 17 SNPs in miRNA-mediated gene networks were identified. We screened potential immune-related genes in CHD and constructed miRNA-mRNA-TF and SNP-miRNA networks, which not only provide inspired insights into the occurrence and the molecular mechanisms of CHD but also lay a foundation for targeting potential biomarkers using immunotherapy and for understanding the molecular mechanisms of CHD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1908, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1921, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is considered a serious threat to human health worldwide, which caused 365,914 deaths in 2017.

Various cellular and molecular-mediated immune mechanisms participate in the occurrence of CHD and promote the development and deterioration of CHD. Although it has been investigated widely, the molecular mechanism and critical regulators involved in IRGs for evaluating CHD patients remain to be further elucidated, which will help to explore the complex pathological process of the formation and development of CHD. In this study, 348 DE-IRGs were identified as significant with respect to CHD by integration analysis of two mRNA microarray datasets and ImmPort database. Next, the intersection of GO term and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis indicated that immune-related terms and pathways were highly enriched. The results suggested that immune-related molecular functions and crucial biological processes are involved in CHD pathogenesis. Also, GSEA enriched pathways are mainly involved in the internal immune network for IgA production and autoimmune theroid disease pathways. The xPierGSEA also showed that DE-IRGs played a vital role in the immune mechanism of CHD, being especially involved in the TCR signaling pathway of na\u00efve CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26020, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on the 348 DE-IRGs, we built a PPI network and obtained eight hub genes using MCODE analysis, including FPR2, RASGRP1, LTBR, ACKR1, PTGS2, JUN, TNFRSF1A, and CYLD to explore the regulatory networks and crucial pathways underlying CHD. Our results demonstrated that FPR2 is at the center of the network including characteristic genes and extended genes, indicating that it might play a potential role in immunoregulation processes. FPR2, a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, plays multifaceted functions, such as a role in sensing bacteria and modulation of immune responses, colonic epithelial homeostasis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. PTGS2 was confirmed to suppress cell viability and proliferation of cells by activating the AKT/NF-\u03baB pathway. Overexpression of TNFRSF1A promoted the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and plays a potential regulatory role in neuronal cell damage. The variant in TNFRSF1A is involved in Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), and can therefore be used as a novel pathogenic therapeutic target. CYLD is a tumor suppressor protein. Studies showed that the loss of function of CYLD can release the polyubiquitin chain in the ubiquitinated substrate, which can then inhibit the I\u03baB\u03b1 Kinase complex and then inhibit the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which is a negative regulator of this signaling pathway. The relationship between the abovementioned hub genes and the immune-related molecular mechanism of CHD has not been confirmed before. In this study, several hub genes were found to be involved in the activation or inhibition of the NF-\u03baB and TNF pathways. These findings are consistent with the Metascape analysis enrichment result, which illustrated that the eight hub genes were mainly enriched in the regulation of defense response, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, regulation of JNK cascade, and regulation of cytokine production. As a key and strictly regulated regulator, the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors is responsible for immune development, immune responses, and inflammation. The false regulation of NF-\u03baB has been implicated in a wide range of diseases ranging from inflammatory to immune disorders. TNF-\u03b1, mainly secreted by macrophages and monocytes, can directly damage vascular endothelial cells, cause a pathological inflammatory reaction, reduce the stability of atherosclerotic plaque, lead to the rupture of atherosclerotic plaque, and indirectly and directly accelerate the formation and development of atherosclerotic plaque.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28621, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "CHD is a complicated disease involving various signaling pathways, protein-coding genes, numerous transcription factors, and post-transcriptional regulation of heart morphogenesis, cardiac development, and cardiac muscle cell differentiation and contractility. It is well known that miRNAs control gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, whereas TFs are involved in the activation or inhibition of transcription at a pre-transcriptional level. Studies have implicated the abnormalities in miRNA expression in CHD: miR-34a protects endothelial function in CHD patients; miR-23a improves restoration of blood flow in the ischemic region; miR-135b and miR-499a induce the proliferation of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cell; miR502 suppresses autophagy; miR-33/33b lowers low-density lipoproteins and raises high-density lipoproteins concentrations; miR-939 in angiogenesis; miR-155 prevents the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis and CHD; miR-126 substantially prevents atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases; miR-21 prevents the formation of neointimal and restenosis of arteries after angioplasty; miR-146 enhances the collateral coronary circulation in ischemic tissue. In this study, we constructed miRNA-TF co-regulatory networks based on candidate immune-related miRNAs, TFs, and hub genes, and performed network analysis to obtain consensus hub nodes, modules, and motifs involved in CHD.
