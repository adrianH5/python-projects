Contributing to 6\u201316% of all ocular pathologies and accounting for 11% of neoplastic phenomena within the orbital realm, NSOI disproportionately impacts middle-aged individuals and manifests a marked female predominance. Despite its epidemiological significance, the pathophysiological underpinnings of NSOI remain substantially elusive. Existing literature tentatively links NSOI with diverse medical conditions such as Streptococcal pharyngitis, viral upper respiratory infections, and a spectrum of autoimmune disorders including rheumatologic conditions, multifocal fibrosis, and Crohn\u2019s disease. The clinical phenotype of NSOI is notably heterogeneous, with presentations ranging from dacryoadenitis and lacrimal gland inflammation to myositis involving singular or multiple extraocular muscles (EOMs), alongside other non-canonical manifestations. Although systemic corticosteroids serve as the cornerstone of current therapeutic regimens, their protracted utilization is marred by a litany of documented adverse sequelae. Moreover, the specter of disease recurrence looms large, exceeding a staggering 50% even following ostensibly successful corticosteroid interventions. Given this backdrop, the imperative to delineate the molecular machinations underpinning NSOI becomes increasingly urgent.

The common SNP rs1997243, located near the GPR146 locus, occurs in 14% of the population and is associated with elevated total cholesterol levels in plasma. Transcriptomic data indicate that GPR146 is predominantly expressed in white adipose tissue, playing a role in adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, GPR146 has also been recognized as an antiviral modulator. Research led by Huang et al. highlighted that GPR146 is upregulated by interferon via a STAT1-dependent pathway. However, surprisingly, GPR146 knockout in murine models did not alter viral susceptibility, a phenomenon possibly explained by the suppression of endogenous GPR146 expression through an IRF3/HES1 signaling pathway in virus-stimulated cells. This suggests a complex and potentially reciprocal interaction between GPR146 and HES1 signaling, with implications for therapeutic strategies against viral infections. Although GPR146 has been extensively studied in the context of lipid-related disorders such as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, its role in other immune-inflammatory conditions is less understood.

Mounting evidence implicates gene expression modulation as pivotal in NSOI pathophysiology, with the orphan G protein-coupled receptor gene GPR146 emerging as a prominent regulator of plasma cholesterol levels. Studies in murine models have demonstrated that GPR146 deficiency confers significant protection against atherosclerosis, reducing lesion areas by up to 90% through an LDL receptor-independent mechanism. Yu et al. recently proposed GPR146 as a susceptibility gene influencing plasma cholesterol metabolism, thereby impacting the development of Atherosclerosis and Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia.

Critical to GPR146-mediated cholesterol homeostasis is the ERK1/2/SREBP2 signaling axis, offering protection against atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia in LDLR-deficient models. Moreover, GPR146 is implicated in modulating antitumoral immune responses, influencing neoplastic growth. The intricate interplay between GPR146 and the immune milieu holds profound implications for various pathological conditions, disease trajectories, therapeutic responses, and prognostic outcomes.

Such data collectively point toward the prospective utility of GPR146 antagonists as potentially superior therapeutic agents compared to existing alternatives. In the realm of biomedical research, the relationship between GPR146 and NSOI has garnered substantial interest. GPR146, a G protein-coupled receptor of potential biological significance, plays a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the specific contributions of GPR146 to the pathogenesis of NSOI and its roles within this disease have not been thoroughly investigated. NSOI is a complex inflammatory orbital disorder with an incompletely understood pathogenic mechanism. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammatory mediators and immune modulators play crucial roles in the progression of NSOI. Given the potential of GPR146 as an immune modulatory molecule, its involvement in regulating inflammatory and immune responses may be significant.
