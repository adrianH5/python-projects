Smaller subsets, such as memory B cells and plasmablasts, span a tighter range (Figure 3A).

Our analysis additionally suggests that women have significantly higher levels of naive CD4+ T cells, naive CD8+ T cells, naive B cells, and plasmablasts than male subjects while having a significantly smaller proportion of effector CD8+ T cells (Figures 3D and 3E).

We detect an association between CXCL10 and monocyte subsets, concordant with evidence that this cytokine is expressed by and acts to recruit monocytes. Furthermore, acute phase reactants interferon alpha-2 and IL-6 are negatively associated with central memory CD8+ T cells and memory B cells, which is concordant with the understanding of the kinetics of the transition from acute inflammation to memory formation.

This shift is primarily driven by increased concentrations of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10, and IL-6. As an example of this modulation, we see that CCL5 concentration is significantly increased during the first and second trimester and is decreased during the third trimester and up to 6 weeks postpartum, but it returns to baseline by 6 months postpartum (Figure 5B).

Flow cytometry data from ImmPort were compensated for fluorescence spillovers using the compensation matrix supplied in each fcs file. All data from ImmPort were arcsinh transformed. For flow cytometry data, the formula f(x) = arcsinh (x/150) was used. For CyTOF data, the formula f(x) = arcsinh (x/8) was used. Transformation and compensation were done using the preprocessing.batch function in MetaCyto. The cell definitions from the Human ImmunoPhenotyping Consortium  were used to identify 24 types of immune cells using the searchClster.batch function in MetaCyto. Specifically, each marker in each cytometry panels was bisected into positive and negative regions. Cells fulfilling the cell definitions are identified. For example, the CD14+ CD33+ CD16- (CD16- monocytes) cell subset corresponds to the cells that fall into the CD14+ region, CD33+ region and CD16- region concurrently. The proportion of each cell subsets in the PBMC or whole blood were then calculated by dividing the number of cells in a subset by the total number of cells in the blood.

Data were drawn from the ImmPort parsed data tables using RMySQL or loaded into R from user-submitted unparsed data tables. Across the studies that contribute data, there are disparities in terms of the dilution of samples and units of measure in which the data are reported. We corrected for differences in dilution factor and units of measure across experiments and standardized labels associated with each protein as HUGO gene symbols. This step represents the \u201cformatted\u201d multiplex ELISA data table. For our own analysis, as represented in Figure 2, we analyzed only those proteins that were measured in more than half of the subjects leaving the 50 most-commonly measured proteins. Compensation for batch effects was conducted using the ComBat function of the R package sva, with study accession representing batch and a model matrix that included age, sex, and race of each subject. Data were log2 transformed before normalization with ComBat to better fit the assumption that the data are normally distributed (Figure S6). We verified that a linear model associating age, sex, ethnicity, and study accession of each subject no longer revealed any significant associations between study accession and protein concentration following batch correction, and that known differences, such as the difference in leptin concentration by sex, were captured following our batch correction procedure. We additionally validated our approach using 1000-fold data simulations (see below). Differences by age, sex, and race were detected with a linear model, with Tukey\u2019s Honestly Significant Difference post hoc tests and Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate.

For data collected on Illumina platforms and stored in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we utilized the getGEO utility in the GEOquery Bioconductor package to read the expression files and the preprocessCore package to conduction rma background correction, quantile normalization, and log2 normalization of the gene expression data. Finally, for data collected on Illumina platforms but not stored in GEO, we utilized the read.ilmn utility of the limma Bioconductor package to read in the data, and the neqc function to rma background correct, quantile normalize, and log2 normalize the gene expression data. In all instances, probe IDs were converted to Entrez Gene IDs. Where multiple probes mapped to the same Entrez Gene ID, the median value across probes was used to represent the expression value of the corresponding gene. The background-corrected and normalized datasets were combined based on common Entrez IDs, missing values were imputed with a k-nearest neighbors algorithm (R package: impute, function: impute.knn) using k= 10 and default values for rowmax, colmax, and maxp.

To assess the efficacy of using an empirical Bayes algorithm to compensate for batch effects in multiplex ELISA data, we generated simulated multiplex ELISA data as skewed normal distributions from a set of parameters selected to mimic those skewed normal distributions that best fit the actual multiplex ELISA data used in our analysis. We generated this data for 50 analytes and 1500 subjects and purposefully introduced batch effects intended to mimic the types of batch effects we might encounter in real multiplex ELISA data. To account for use of a differently calibrated machine, for example, we simulated data in which one batch had a higher mean than the other batches. To account for the possibility that one lab\u2019s data might be more variable than others, in one simulation we introduced random noise into one batch of the data. Finally, to account for the fact that the antibodies used may differ in efficacy across lots and experiments, we devised a simulation in which just one analyte in just one batch has a perturbed mean. In each of 1000 simulations of this data, we then generated a linear model to test whether the empirical Bayes algorithm ComBat would successfully correct for these deviations from the true value of the simulated data. Additionally, we took the largest single batch of multiplex ELISA data (data from ImmPort study SDY 420) and intentionally introduced the same 3 types of batch effects we introduced into the simulated data.
