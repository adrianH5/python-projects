Melanoma accounts for more than 75% of all deaths from skin tumors due to its high malignancy, susceptibility to metastasis, and lethality. Since 1975, the incidence of melanoma has been increasing worldwide. Melanoma has a 5-year survival rate of 98% after surgical treatment, while this percentage drop significantly for advanced or metastatic melanoma. For advanced melanoma, treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Melanoma is one of the most immunogenic tumors due to its high mutational burden, therefore immunotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of advanced melanoma, and popular immunotherapeutic agents include ipilimumab targeting CTLA-4 and nivolumab targeting PD-1. But often only a few patients respond well to immunotherapy. Various factors such as the considerations of the tumor cells themselves and the state of tumor microenvironment (TME) can affect the effectiveness of immunotherapy, tumors with a high degree of immune infiltration, tend to have a better treatment outcome. The TME contains a large number of immune cells, and the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells significantly affects the development of tumor invasion, clinical response and treatment outcome. Since the immune system can detect and destroy tumor cells through immunosurveillance or play a pro-tumor role by suppressing immune activity and promoting anti-inflammatory responses, the immune environment varies greatly from one individual to another and the prognosis and response to treatment varies as well. Currently, no prognostic markers are widely recognized in melanoma, it is important to searching for effective molecular biomarkers of melanoma to predict the prognosis and identify personalized treatments, especially for patients with advanced melanoma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 4184, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs with transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, which do not encode proteins, but can regulate protein expression levels by interacting with RNA, DNA or proteins to perform biological functions.

Studies show lncRNA also plays an important role in melanoma, for example, LINC00518, which promotes melanoma metastasis through miR-204-5p/AP1S2 axis and HCP5, can regulate RARRES3 expression to inhibit melanoma progression. Other studies have shown that lncRNAs are actively involved in the regulation of differentiation, function and gene expression of multiple immune cells in the immune process. For example, lncRNA CamK-A further contributes to tumor progression by activating Ca2+-dependent signaling and participating in the remodeling of the TME.

Currently, the most effective treatment for early-stage melanoma is surgical resection, while immunotherapy has shown an active role for unresectable or metastatic tumors. However, the response to immunotherapy varies from person to person, and only a small percentage of patients benefit from it. Therefore, finding effective biomarkers to predict the effect of immunotherapy is of great importance to help clinicians choose the treatment. Tumor immune infiltration affects many aspects of tumor in terms of growth, invasion, metastasis, and prognosis. It has been demonstrated that specific immune components play a prognostic role in cancer. For example, in colon cancer, the immunoscore measured by quantifying the density of CD3+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumor and infiltrating margins has been shown to be a better clinical risk assessment tool than the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification system for prediction. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, researchers have gained a deeper understanding of non-coding RNAs. lncRNAs can influence gene expression levels by regulating transcription and translation and are involved in the development of a variety of diseases. Currently, studies of immune-related lncRNA signatures have been reported in a variety of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. These studies suggest that immune-related lncRNA signatures are of great value in predicting the prognosis of carcinoma patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 21517, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we established an immune-related prognostic signature consisting of 5 lncRNAs, including HLA-DQB1-AS1, MIR205HG, RP11-643G5.6, USP30-AS1 and RP11-415F23.4. Among the five immune-related lncRNAs that constitute the signature, HLA-DQB1-AS1 is thought to be associated with prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of MIR205HG is upregulated in a variety of cancers and is associated with multiple pathways, particularly immune response and epidermal development. TP53 mutations significantly increase MIR205HG expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and stimulate proliferation, migration and clonal activity of cancer cells. In melanoma, MIR205HG supports melanoma growth through the miR-299-3p/VEGFA axis and is a prognostic biomarker. USP30-AS1 is an autophagy-related lncRNA associated with the prognosis of cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and bladder urothelial carcinoma. The above studies demonstrate that these lncRNAs promote tumor progression in a variety of tumors and correlate with prognosis. To investigate whether immune-associated lncRNA signature can be an independent prognostic factor for cutaneous melanoma, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, which showed that lncRNA signature is an independent prognostic factor for cutaneous melanoma independent from clinicopathological features.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 22875, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The results of GSEA analysis showed that the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, chemokine-signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway were enriched in low-risk populations, and the degree of immune infiltration was higher. TRL agonist is an essential immunostimulant, TRL7 can effectively activate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells and then activate anti-tumor immune response. Imiquimod, a TRL agonist, has been used as an immunomodulatory agent in the treatment of some cancers such as basal cell carcinoma. The JAK-STAT pathway is involved in a variety of immune processes including recognition of tumor cells and tumor immune escape, this complex regulation of the tumor microenvironment makes targeting JAK-stat an essential strategy for anti-tumor studies. Immunotherapy associated with above signaling pathways is more likely to have better therapeutic outcomes in low-risk populations. Whereas GPI anchor biosynthesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism-related genes are enriched in high-risk populations, high-risk populations may benefit from metabolism-related therapies. However, further studies are needed for the above.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 24031, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "By comparing the survival of high- and low-risk groups in different immune checkpoint gene expression levels, it was found that the prognosis was best in the low-risk high-immune checkpoint gene expression group, the prognosis of the low-risk population was better than that of the high-risk population. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown positive results in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, but only a small subset of patients show good responses. Major factors affecting the response to immunotherapy include melanoma cell-related factors, the immune infiltration status of the tumor, and factors determined by the whole organism. Tumor microenvironment with higher degree of immune infiltration, ie, immunogenicity, shows better clinical response to immune checkpoint therapy, while non-immunogenic tumor microenvironment shows poorer immune response. Considering the complex process of antitumor immunity, the expression level of immune checkpoint genes cannot fully and effectively predict the effect of immunotherapy, and new biomarkers are needed to select and optimize treatment modalities. Tumor immune cell components play an important role in the immunotherapeutic response. To further explore the relationship between immune-related lncRNA signature and tumor immune infiltration, we performed CIBERSORT and GSAE analysis. The results showed a higher infiltration of M1 macrophages, activated memory CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the low-risk group, while M2 macrophages were more infiltrated in the high-risk group. It has been demonstrated that CD8 T cells located at the tumor invasive margin in melanoma can predict clinical response to PD-1 blockade therapy and positively correlate with response to pembrolizumab. Activation of CD4 T cells enhances cytotoxic T cell responses and can help patients benefit from immunotherapy. M1 macrophages have pro-inflammatory activity and play an anti-tumor role, while M2 macrophages have anti-inflammatory activity and promote tumor growth. It has been shown that the anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors can be enhanced by repolarizing M2 macrophages to M1 macrophages. These results may suggest that low-risk scores are associated with a better response to immunotherapy. We also compared the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agents in high- and low-risk groups and found that the high-risk group was more sensitive to Doxorubicin and Vinblastine, and the low-risk group was more sensitive to Cisplatin and Docetaxel, indicating that our lncRNA signature has the potential to provide guidance for the use of chemotherapeutic agents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 26647, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are still some limitations in our study.
