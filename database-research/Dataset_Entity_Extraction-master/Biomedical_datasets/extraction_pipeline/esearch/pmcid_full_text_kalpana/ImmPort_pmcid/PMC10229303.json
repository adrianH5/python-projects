It originated in the 18th century when Edward Jenner discovered that vaccinia protected against smallpox, opening the door to the development of a vaccine. Since then, vaccines have gained much attention for their ability to prevent and treat diseases, especially infectious ones. The current outbreak of COVID-19 has made people aware of the importance of vaccine development, especially mRNA vaccines. It is worth mentioning that the application of mRNA vaccines is not limited to infectious diseases, and breakthrough progress has been made in the development of mRNA vaccines for some specific cancer types. tumor mutation load, microsatellite instability, and changes in tumor microenvironment all provide clues for the development of mRNA vaccine. It is of great clinical significance to explore the immune microenvironment of tumors and screen potential mRNA vaccines. The original mRNA vaccines had some disadvantages such as instability, excessive immunogenicity, and lack of delivery system. However, as the technology improves, mRNA vaccines are emerging as an effective and stable new treatment option for cancer and viral diseases. Now mRNA vaccines are becoming more attractive.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2849, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Melanoma is a kind of malignant tumor highly related to immunity.

Therefore, our understanding of the immune microenvironment of melanoma is still inadequate. However, the advent of RNA vaccines has opened the door to treatments for refractory melanoma. Sahin et al. found that FixVac (BNT111), an intravenous liposomal RNA vaccine, induced strong and persistent CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity.

In the immune microenvironment of melanoma, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 and programmed cell death protein-1 on the T-cell membrane bind to ligands on dendritic cells, thereby attenuating tumor immunity and leading to tumor progression. Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitors based on CTLA-4 and PD-1 have been approved for the immunotherapy of melanoma. Therefore, antigen-presenting cells, especially dendritic cells, play an important role in tumor immunity and immunotherapy. Many current mRNA vaccines are also associated with dendritic cells. By introducing mRNA encoding tumor antigens into dendritic cells, the dendritic cells can express tumor antigens, thereby activating immune responses and treating tumors.

We identified potential tumor-associated antigens in melanoma patients: GZMB, GBP4, CD79A, APOBEC3F, IDO1, JCHAIN, LAG3, PLA2G2D, XCL2. GZMB is a Granzyme subfamily of proteins associated with chronic inflammation and wound healing. GBP4 protein is a kind of guanosine binding protein, which is related to cytokine signal transduction in the immune system and has GTP enzyme activity. CD79A protein is involved in antigen-activated B cell receptor signalling pathways. Apobec3f-related research has focused on immune system diseases, especially immunodeficiency diseases. Current studies have shown that IDO1 is highly correlated with glucose metabolism and amino acid metabolism. JCHAIN is involved mainly through the binding of scavenger receptors and ligands. LAG3 protein is mainly involved in the antigen presentation of MHCII molecules and the antigen processing and presentation of MHCII molecules. The pathways involved by PLA2G2D include PE acyl chain remodelling and oxytocin signalling. XCL2 is mainly involved in the activation pathway of the chemokine superfamily.
