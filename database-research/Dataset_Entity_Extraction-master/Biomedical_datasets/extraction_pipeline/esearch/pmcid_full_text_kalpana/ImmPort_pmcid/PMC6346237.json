A total of 1534 immune\u2010related genes from The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) were used as candidates to construct the signature. Using univariate Cox analysis, we evaluated the relationship between overall survival and immune\u2010related genes expression and found 272 immune\u2010related genes with predicting prognostic ability. In order to construct an efficient predictive model, the Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic\u2010net penalty was used and identified 23 groups after 1000 iterations.

Then, we further conducted the K\u2010M analysis for stage III\u2010IV KIRP patients, considering the positive correlation between the immune\u2010related risk signature and tumor stage. We found that the overall survival (OS) of advanced stage patients was also positively correlated with high\u2010risk score in all of the three cohorts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, Figure 4E,H, Figure 7A). We also demonstrated that the risk signature could predict the OS of subgroup of KIRP, including patients with recurrence (Figure 7B, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), no recurrence (Figure 7C, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), M0 stage (Figure 7D, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), N0 stage (Figure 7E, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), T3 stage (Figure 7F, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), T2 stage (Figure 7G, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), female (Figure 7H, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), male (Figure 7I, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and type 2 KIRP (Figure 7K, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, there was no correlation between the risk score and patients\u2019 OS in type 1 KIRP patients (Figure 7J). The univariate Cox analysis of risk signature and clinical parameters in training, testing, and total group is demonstrated in Table 2. In the multivariate analysis, the signature was able to serve as an independent prognostic factor for OS with a HR of 4.800 in training group (95% confidence interval [95%CI]\u00a0=\u00a02.941\u20107.836, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Figure 4C, Table 3), 2.079 in testing group (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.035\u20104.176, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, Figure 4F, Table 3), and 2.613 in the total cohort (1.826\u20103.738, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Figure 5B, Table 3). But we found that the signature just exhibited prognostic ability in training and total group after we included the T, N, and M stages as independent clinical parameters (Tables S5 and S6). This might be caused by the small sample size since we excluded cases with unknown T, N, or M stages.

This leads to the difficulty of in\u2010depth investigation for the treatment strategies and prognostic prediction of KIRP. Taking into account the importance of immune environment in the progression of cancer,33 it is essential to find out immune\u2010related biomarker for the prognosis of KIRP patients, which may also serve as a significant role in immunotherapy. Our study established a robust immune\u2010related risk signature for KIRP using the TCGA KIRP datasets that was able to predict the patients\u2019 survival outcomes and was significantly correlated with clinicopathologic features. More importantly, we found this signature was associated with CNV and was involved in many immune\u2010related gene ontology terms.

In our signature, we found 11 of the 15 genes were cytokines or cytokine receptors, functioning as significant parts in inflammatory process of tumor initiation and progression.34, 35 This can be further understood by the explanation that cytokines and their receptors can activate potential oncogenic transcription factors in STAT and NF\u03baB families to promote the pathogenesis of cancer.36 Therefore, KIRP patients with high\u2010immune risk of our established signature can reflect to an increased tumor inflammatory microenvironment, which facilitates the progression of KIRP and leads to the poor OS of patients. More interestingly, in the 15 immune\u2010related genes that consist of the signature, PSMD11 was the most significant factor in the univariate analysis (HR\u00a0=\u00a0439.498). The PSMD11 protein consists of part of 26S proteasome which is involved in protein homeostasis through removing misfolded proteins.37 Hence, PSMD11 participates in the antigen processing process. Besides, PSMD11 was one of the suggested mechanisms for several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.38 Therefore, we suggested the intriguing intersection of neuroscience and immuno\u2010oncology bridging by PSMD11. PTN was another gene in the signature that attracts our attention.

Our investigation was the first to find the immune\u2010related differences between the different clinical cohorts in KIRP. It can also be referred that the differences in tumor immunity may reflect the OS of different clinical cohorts. Patients with high\u2010immune risk may own a tumor immune microenvironment that can promote the development and recurrence of KIRP, which leads to advanced stage and relapse of tumor. Therefore, our signature can not only predict patients\u2019 survival outcomes but predict the possibility of disease progression and relapse.

Interestingly, our study found there was a positive relationship between the risk signature and chromosome deletion aberrations. Chromosome aberrations contain many immune system genes, such as chemokine (CXC\u2010motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL10, cytokine\u2010dependent hematopoietic cell linker (CLNK), and alpha\u2010protein kinase 1 (ALPK1) (https://www.uniprot.org/docs/humchr04. txt).17 Hence, we consider that there may exist a connection between the 15 immune\u2010related genes of the signature and the immune system genes in chromosome deletion aberrations. The copy number loss of these immune system genes in chromosome may affect the expression or function of the 15 immune\u2010related genes and patients\u2019 survival outcomes. Further studies are needed to verify our hypothesis. Finally, our GSEA can further prove the robust connection of the signature with immune systems. Patients with high\u2010risk score were more associated with immune\u2010related pathways, especially the adaptive immune response. Besides, high\u2010risk group patients had more CD8+ and CD4+ T\u2010cell infiltration, which reflect an immunological microenvironment of KIRP. Further study showed that high\u2010risk group patients tended to have higher PD\u2010L2, PD\u2010L1, PD\u20101, and CTL\u20104 expression in tumor environment. This indicates that despite the high infiltration of T cells in KIRP microenvironment, the function of T cells is inhibited by PD\u20101\u2010 or CTL\u20104\u2010mediated suppression pathways. Therefore, high\u2010risk patients were more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockade targeting PD\u20101 and CTLA4. This also accords with the study of Yu\u2010Pei Chen et al41 their study also suggest that tumors with pre\u2010existing intratumor T cells that express high level of PD\u2010L1 and are suppressed by PD\u20101/PD\u2010L1 pathway are most likely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockade.
