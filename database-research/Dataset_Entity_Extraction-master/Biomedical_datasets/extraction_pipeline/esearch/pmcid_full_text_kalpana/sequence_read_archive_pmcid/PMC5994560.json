Transitioning from water to land was a critical step in vertebrate evolution, but the immune adaptations that mucosal barriers such as the skin underwent during that process are essentially unknown. Vertebrate animals such as the African lungfish have a bimodal life, switching from freshwater to terrestrial habitats when environmental conditions are not favorable. African lungfish skin mucus secretions contribute to the terrestrialization process by forming a cocoon that surrounds and protects the lungfish body. The goal of this study was to characterize the skin mucus immunoproteome of African lungfish, Protopterus dolloi, before and during the induction phase of terrestrialization as well as the immunoproteome of the gill mucus during the terrestrialization induction phase. Using LC-MS/MS, we identified a total of 974 proteins using a lungfish Illumina RNA-seq database, 1,256 proteins from previously published lungfish sequence read archive and 880 proteins using a lungfish 454 RNA-seq database for annotation in the three samples analyzed (free-swimming skin mucus, terrestrialized skin mucus, and terrestrialized gill mucus). The terrestrialized skin mucus proteome was enriched in proteins with known antimicrobial functions such as histones and S100 proteins compared to free-swimming skin mucus. In support, gene ontology analyses showed that the terrestrialized skin mucus proteome has predicted functions in processes such as viral process, defense response to Gram-negative bacterium, and tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling. Importantly, we observed a switch in immunoglobulin heavy chain secretion upon terrestrialization, with IgW1 long form (IgW1L) and IgM1 present in free-swimming skin mucus and IgW1L, IgM1, and IgM2 in terrestrialized skin mucus. Combined, these results indicate an increase in investment in the production of unique immune molecules in P. dolloi skin mucus in response to terrestrialization that likely better protects lungfish against external aggressors found in land.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2297, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2310, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Transitioning to life on land was a fundamental step in the success and diversification of the vertebrate lineage.

Lungfish are evolutionarily unique organisms that have the ability to undergo conditional aestivation. Aestivation is a state of metabolic torpor, which is an adaptation for survival in areas that are subject to extreme environmental conditions. During droughts, as water evaporates from the rivers and food becomes scarce, lungfish detect environmental cues and turn them into internal signals that induce behavioral, physiological, and biochemical changes in preparation of aestivation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3922, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are four extant species of African lungfish: P. aethiopicus, P. annectens, P. amphibious, and P. dolloi, which implement different aestivation strategies to survive prolonged dry periods. The best-known method of aestivation is that of P. annectens. As water recedes, P. annectens will start to burrow into the mud while simultaneously secreting large quantities of mucus through its gills. This is the induction phase of aestivation. Once it has burrowed deep enough into the mud, it curls back on itself, leaving its head facing the opening of the burrow. As the water dissipates completely, the mucus/mud mixture coating around the lungfish body hardens forming a cocoon that protects the animal for months. Once encased, the lungfish ceases feeding and locomotive activities, has to prevent cell death, and sustain a slow rate of waste production until conditions become favorable, this is the maintenance phase of aestivation, where the lungfish can lay dormant for years. Upon the introduction of water, the lungfish instantly awakens from dormancy, leaves the mucus cocoon, and slowly swims toward the surface of the water for air. This is the final phase of aestivation, known as arousal, which is completed a week after water is again available and marks the return to a normal metabolic rate. P. dolloi, however, uses a different aestivation strategy as they do not burrow into the mud and do not appear to completely reduce their metabolic rate. During the induction phase, P. dolloi coil up on the surface of the mud while secreting mucus which, over time, turns into a dried mucus cocoon. Thus, P. dolloi\u2019s mode of aestivation has been coined as \u201cterrestrialization,\u201d which is different from the complete aestivation and the full metabolic torpor observed in P. annectens. Both P. dolloi and P. annectens can be terrestrialized in the laboratory setting making them ideal models to study the effects of air exposure on the vertebrate mucosal immune system.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5904, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Throughout tetrapod evolution different strategies were co-opted to maintain barrier integrity and defend against external aggressors.

Hence, we took advantage of the ability to terrestrialize lungfish in the laboratory setting as a model to study the water-to-land transition.
