FT levels in the co mutant were very low throughout the day in LD+FR+temp, LD, and LD+FR (Fig. 4a-c), implying that CO function is essential for FT induction even under conditions more similar to the natural environment. We then analyzed FT expression patterns in photoreceptor and light signaling mutants, circadian clock mutants, and mutants in the ambient temperature flowering pathway in LD+FR+temp (Fig. 4a-f and Supplementary Fig. 16).

To grow the phyA mutant outside, we utilized non-transgenic phyA-201 allele (Ler background), since phyA-211 possesses a transgene. phyA-201 flowered later than Ler plants outside (Supplementary Fig. 17a). Previous studies posited that a certain amount of FR light is required to observe phyA-dependent effects on flowering, as phyA mutants only showed a late flowering phenotype in LD with lower R/FR ratio in the afternoon or in continuous FR light conditions. In LD+FR+temp conditions, both phyA-201 and phyA-211 flowered later than their parental accessions (Supplementary Fig. 17a). These results indicate that both natural LD and LD+FR+temp conditions (R/FR=1) contain enough FR light to observe the phyA contribution to flowering induction. We also analyzed FT expression in phyA-201, and found that FT levels were lower in both morning and afternoon than Ler plants (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c). This result indicates that, although phyA is clearly involved in FT induction in the morning, its contribution to afternoon FT expression may differ in either different backgrounds and/or alleles. We further assessed the significance of the phyA signaling using the far-red elongated hypocotyl 1 (fhy1) fhy1-like (fhl) mutant (Col-0 background) in which phyA signaling is severely attenuated due to impairment of phyA nuclear transport.

We therefore hypothesized that phyA may affect ELF3 function by directly modulating the interaction of ELF3 with other factors in a light/temperature-dependent manner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 25259, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To assess whether phyA influences the composition of the ELF3 complex, we harvested ELF3:ELF3\u20136H3F samples with/without the phyA mutation in the morning of LD+FR+temp conditions, and identified peptides co-immunoprecipitated with ELF3 using mass spectrometry analysis. We included ELF3:ELF3\u20136H3F/phyB as a reference. When we compared our peptide list of ELF3:ELF3\u20136H3F samples with the previous ones harvested in the afternoon, we noticed that our list did not contain peptides from ELF3-associated circadian clock proteins (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that ELF3 does not assemble with the same Evening Complex in the morning. We identified peptides derived from COP1 but not SPA1. phyB is still important for ELF3 complex formation in the morning. The loss of phyA did not seem to drastically change the composition of the ELF3 complex, although fewer peptides from COP1 and phyE were detected in the phyA background (Supplementary Table 2). These results indicate that phyA may affect the interaction of a small number of components in the ELF3 complex. However, these results are not sufficient to evaluate whether those changes may affect either ELF3 function or FT transcription in the phyA mutant in LD+FR+temp.

To test this, we analyzed the diurnal expression profile of CO protein in CO:HA-CO plants in LD and LD+FR+temp. The overall accumulation patterns of CO protein in LD and LD+FR+temp were similar (Fig. 5a). However, CO protein increased more in LD+FR+temp than in LD at the ZT4 time point, when the FT morning peak was induced (Fig. 5a). Therefore, we analyzed a fine scale time course of CO profiles during the morning. In LD, CO protein acutely accumulated just after dawn (ZT0.5\u20131) but quickly degraded by ZT2 (Fig. 5b). In LD+FR+temp, CO protein levels kept increasing until ZT1, and then decreased more gradually during the morning.

Both phyA and ELF3 physically interact with the COP1/SPA1 complex to regulate its function. We therefore investigated whether phyA and/or ELF3 mediate FT regulation through regulation of CO protein stability. We found that ELF3 is in the same CO protein complex in planta and in vivo (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 23). In addition, FT expression and the early flowering phenotype of elf3\u20131 were largely dependent on functional CO, as FT expression levels are very low in both co-101 and elf3\u20131 co-101, and elf3\u20131 co-101 flowered just slightly earlier than the late flowering co-101 mutant (Supplementary Fig. 24). Although the FT levels in the elf3\u20131 co-101 mutant are similar to those in the previously characterized elf3\u20131 co-1 mutant, the elf3\u20131 co-1 mutant showed an intermediate flowering phenotype between the co-1 and elf3\u20131 mutants. This flowering time difference might be caused by the difference in the genetic backgrounds (elf3\u20131 co-1 in F3 segregants between Col-0 and Landsberg cross, vs. elf3\u20131 co-101 in Col-0) and/or co alleles. We next analyzed whether ELF3 influences CO stability, and found that CO protein was more abundant in the elf3 mutant, including at ZT4 (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 25). Together with our results that showed lower levels of ELF3 protein in LD+FR+temp, these results indicate that ELF3 may negatively influence CO stability in the morning, and that LD+FR+temp conditions in part reduce the amount of the negative regulator to increase CO protein stability, consistent with increased expression of its target FT.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 29403, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 29414, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results indicate that the difference in R/FR ratios and daily temperature are the main causes of the difference in flowering time between natural LD and lab LD conditions.

Previous work indicated that FT induced between ZT12 and ZT20 in SD was more effective for floral induction than FT induced during other time windows. How does morning-expressed FT affect flowering compared to evening-expressed? The uploading of FT proteins into the phloem and the unloading of them into the shoot apical meristem are actively regulated, at least in cucurbit plants. Phloem flux and the concentration of major transport sugars in phloem sap exhibit diurnal and developmental changes in some plants. Therefore, the efficiency of florigen movement may change depending on growth conditions, time of day, and plant age.

This model shows temporal expression patterns of CO protein (top) and FT transcripts (bottom) under lab LD (e) and natural LD (f) conditions. e, Under artificial lab LD conditions in which the R/FR ratio is equal to or greater than 2 and the temperature is constant, CO protein appears to immediately accumulate after light onset and then rapidly degrade, resulting in low levels of CO protein in the morning and early afternoon. During this period, ELF3 protein inhibits FT expression through an unknown mechanism. CO protein peaks again at the end of the day, which directly activates FT transcription under these conditions. f, Under natural LD conditions, the R/FR ratio is 1 and the ambient temperature oscillates throughout the day. The amount of phyA protein increases in the morning, whereas the amount of ELF3 protein decreases (Fig. 3i, j). CO protein accumulates rapidly at high levels after sunrise, and CO protein degrades more slowly under natural LD conditions than under lab LD conditions. This CO accumulation might be important for morning induction of FT. In addition to the CO protein stability changes, there might be other factors (depicted as \u201cX\u201d) involved in the induction of morning FT under natural LD conditions. The phyA signal is positively involved in FT induction under these conditions. ELF3 negatively acts on FT regulation under these conditions. In addition, the temperature oscillations strongly repress FT transcription in the evening. Therefore, although CO protein abundance is high even at dusk, the levels of FT expression remain relatively low around dusk compared to morning. We showed that we can recreate these FT expression profiles in the lab by simply adjusting the R/FR ratio of light source and temperature conditions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}]
