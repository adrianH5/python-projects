The tubes of the microcosms were hermetically sealed in such a way as to generate conditions of microaerophilia. The samples were kept without shaking in order not to disturb the formation of biofilms. At the water-diesel interface in microcosms, a planktonic and filamentous biofilm was observed (Fig.\u00a01). The sequences of ribosomal 16S gene of the microbial community capable of growing under these conditions belong mainly to the class of Gammaproteobacteria. In the sample grown with diesel as the only source of carbon, more than 90% of the bacteria are sequestered in this class of bacteria with versatile metabolic potential (Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary data, Table 1 class level). Microbiome composition of biofilm microcosms at genus level suggested the presence of electrogenic taxa like Shewanella sp (Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary data: Table 1 genus level). The evidence of Shewanella sp and filamentous structure in the planktonic biofilm suggest to verify the electrogenicity of microcosms. In particular, Liquid Microbial Fuel Cells (L-MFC) have been developed by modifying the tubes (Falcon, 50\u00a0ml tubes) from which the biofilm originates (Fig.\u00a03A, B, Supplementary Fig. 1). The use of a micropositioner (Fig.\u00a03C) with an electrode that could be positioned on the growing biofilm, made possible micromovements of the electrode, to test the electrogenicity of the biofilm. By placing the electrode of the micropositioner in parts other than the biofilm, it did not produce electrogenicity. In order to obtain a complete electrical characterization of the L-MFCs, a custom electronic analyzer dedicated to microbial fuel cells was used: polarization and power curves were determined (Fig.\u00a04 A, B). A prototype L-MFC was analysed to explore the presence, along with water column, of microbial filaments: filamentous structures were observed up to distances of 6-7\u00a0cm from the biofilm (Fig.\u00a05). In order to study the filamentation processes, different oxygen concentrations and their correlations with filaments formation were analysed during bacterial growth. The filaments were increasingly evident below 3.5\u00a0mg /L of oxygen. Below these oxygen values, filaments with rounded bacterial spore-like cells appeared in the samples. (Fig.\u00a06 A\u2013D). TEM analysis of these spore like cells revealed a \u201cmyelin like\u201d multisheath composition (Fig.\u00a07). CLSM analysis revealed lipid contents of these multisheath structures (Fig.\u00a08, FM 1-43 staining) when stained with a specific dye for biological membranes also neuronal such as FM 1-43. At CLSM and western blot (data not shown) these bacterial spheroidal cells, revealed also cross-reactivity in comparison to internal control (bacillary forms), with oligodendrocyte proteins of vertebrates (Fig.\u00a09) such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and Claudin 11 (O4).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12793, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Experimental Design", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12813, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The formation of biofilms on surfaces other than solid ones represents an emerging topic, especially for biofilms that grow between liquids of different densities.

The PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) tube was equipped with two caps of PVC (Polyvinylchloride). The top cap was equipped with six brass nozzles to allow the entry of liquids and the insertion of 0.5\u00a0cm diameter pipes to regulate the gas exchanges in the tank. Two holes with adjustable ring nut allowed the sliding and fixing of two hollow steel rods. The bottom cap hole was connected to a brass nozzle for draining the tank. The hollow steel rods at one end were connected to two annular supports in ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) where the electrodes were housed. Each electrode was soldered to the end of a copper wire which was closed and insulated with plastic, inside the hollow steel rods. The copper wires in the upper end were connected to the equipment used for RP measurements. The vertical movement of the hollow steel rods made it possible to move the electrodes in the L-MFC water column to the height desired by the operator. RP readings were obtained by placing one electrode on the biofilm (anode) and the other in the solution containing the bacteria (cathode). For this study two carbon plates of about 4, 6\u00a0cm2 were used as electrodes for redox measurement. RP measurements were performed at a steady state. A custom electronic analyzer dedicated to microbial fuel cells was also used to obtain a complete electrical characterization of the L-MFCs. This measurement tool allowed complete electrical characterization of the L-MFCs through analysis of the charge and discharge phases of MFCs, with accurate determination of the values of voltage (V), power density (W/m 2), and current density (A/m 2).
