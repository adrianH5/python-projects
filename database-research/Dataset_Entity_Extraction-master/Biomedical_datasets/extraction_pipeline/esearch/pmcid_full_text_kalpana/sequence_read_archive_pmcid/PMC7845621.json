Coexpression networks are built from transcriptomic studies across a range of conditions, incorporating broad and unbiased analyses of gene expression at a global scale. The gene-by-condition matrix found in most transcriptomic studies can be used for differential gene expression analysis, where the effects of a perturbation or a mutation can be compared to a background or the wild type. In contrast, a coexpression network transforms the gene-by-condition matrix into a gene-by-gene matrix, or equivalently, a gene network, where the edge weight defines the degree of coexpression. To estimate this coexpression, several methods have been proposed, including the Pearson correlation coefficient, the Spearman correlation coefficient, or a partial correlation coefficient. Although coexpression approaches to identify gene function have been used extensively in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans, it has only recently been applied to full effect in other fungi, as in the recent work from Meyer and colleagues. Not only does coexpression have high predictive accuracy for gene function annotations, it also captures evolutionary-scale changes in cell identity. For nonmodel organisms such as Candida albicans, there are two important questions. (i) Is there utility in building a species-specific coexpression network, or are all the relevant coexpression signatures available through orthology with a model organism (e.g., S. cerevisiae)? (ii) How extensive does the transcriptional profiling need to be to generate useful coexpression networks?

There is significant effort in determining gene function for C. albicans, with the goal of identifying essential genes, virulence factors, or regulators of drug resistance and thus expanding the target space for future antifungal development. Gene Ontology (GO) term annotation is one framework for describing gene function. For a gene to be fully annotated, it requires an understanding of the molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC). The C. albicans genome consists of 6,468 open reading frames (ORFs), and approximately 70% of these ORFs remain undercharacterized. As an extreme set, 1,801 ORFs have no biological process GO term annotation in the Candida Genome Database. In many cases, gene annotation information comes from inferred orthology with the model yeast S. cerevisiae, but these organisms last shared a common ancestor approximately 150 million years ago (MYA), and even gene essentiality is not necessarily conserved across these species. Current high-throughput approaches for gene function analysis include transposon insertion screens, functional genomic screens of mutant libraries, genetic interaction screens, yeast two-hybrid approaches, and other protein-protein interaction screens.

To build the Candida albicans coexpression network (CalCEN), we identified RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies from the NCBI Sequence Read Archives (SRA), which we then filtered for studies with at least 20 C. albicans samples based on the guidelines from Ballouz and colleagues, yielding 12 unpaired and 6 paired end studies, listed in Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material. By requiring at least 20 sequencing runs, this allows for measurement of both intra- and interstudy variation. The conditions for these experiments included differences in carbon source, coculture with host cells or bacteria, treatment with chemical perturbations, or differences in mutations, highlighting the diversity in conditions covered by these studies. Additionally, some of the experiments were performed on different strains of C. albicans, including SC5314, CAI-4, and DSY1050. To ensure that all studies were processed consistently, we collected the raw reads from SRA and realigned all of the data to the C. albicans SC5314 genome Assembly 22 coding transcripts using RSEM with bowtie2 and generated a heatmap combining all of the RNAseq reads (Fig.\u00a01A). One caveat is that some strains may have single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that would change the mapping of certain reads against the SC5314 reference genome. Since RNAseq of cocultured samples can lead to low coverage depth, we removed runs where greater than 50% of the genes had zero expression (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material), yielding 853 runs in total. To control for the bias that more reads will map to longer genes, we used the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) as the estimated expression for each gene under each condition. Because the primary aim of our study is to evaluate the utility of coexpression as a data source, we used the simple yet robust Spearman rank correlation to measure the correlation between gene expression profiles, as implemented in the EGAD R package (Fig.\u00a01B).

This degree null predictor is often a surprisingly strong predictor for retrospective gene function prediction because multifunctional genes, such as well-studied signaling hubs, tend to be both well connected and annotated for many functions. However, this predictor has low utility for prospective gene function prediction as it cannot find new genes for a function of interest, and it cannot find a new function for a gene of interest.

We observed no overlap in the top 50 coexpressed genes when comparing CaSec63 as the seed protein to C4_06590W. In C. albicans, mutations in cell cycle often result in constitutive filamentation in the absence of an inducing cue. Therefore, we examined the phenotype of the tetO-C4_06590W/C4_06590W\u0394 mutant strain in the presence or absence of doxycycline to repress target gene transcription (Fig.\u00a05B). In this strain, one allele has been deleted, and the remaining allele is under the control of the tetO doxycycline-repressible promoter. When C4_06590W was repressed, the majority of the cells showed germ tube formation in the absence of an inducing cue (Fig.\u00a05C). However, nuclear division appeared normal, with each cell containing just one nucleus (Fig.\u00a05C). We then tested growth in the presence of hydroxyurea, a DNA synthesis inhibitor that induces S-phase arrest. Depletion of C4_06590W resulted in hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea, as observed by a decrease in growth (Fig.\u00a05D) and a striking increase in the number of filaments at subinhibitory concentrations of the drug (Fig.\u00a05E). Together, these data suggest that C4_06590W is involved in cell cycle control in C. albicans, and we have therefore proposed CCJ1, for cell cycle DnaJ, as the new gene name for C4_06590W.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28271, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "DISCUSSION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28282, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Coexpression has been shown to be a reliable means of identifying genes that share function in a variety of contexts. Genome scale coexpression networks built from bulk RNAseq studies have been used extensively for gene function prediction using guilt by association. Recently, coexpression networks using microarray data have been built for nonmodel organisms, including Aspergillus niger. In A. niger, coexpression helped in the identification of a transcription factor network that controls the production of the A. niger antifungal peptide (AnAFP), as well as two novel transcription factors that regulate secondary metabolite clusters. Comparative coexpression between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae from microarray data helped identify regulatory motifs that were conserved between the two species. Here, we develop the CalCEN, a coexpression network for C. albicans from available large-scale, publicly available RNAseq studies. RNAseq has greater coverage and higher dynamic range than microarray studies, allowing for more nuanced analysis of coexpression patterns. We show that this network is built from sufficient data to meaningfully organize genes into functional modules and retrospectively predict gene annotations. We demonstrate the utility of this network to predict functional networks around several classes of genes, including ribosomal proteins and the ergosterol biosynthetic cascade. Moreover, the CalCEN analysis of histone proteins accurately identified a separation of the noncanonical Hht1 histone H3 protein from the canonical histone protein complex, whereas both H2A variants are highly coexpressed. Coexpression analysis of GPI-anchored proteins in C. albicans showed a variety of clusters with different enrichments for biological functions, highlighting that not all cell wall-associated proteins are involved in cell wall biosynthesis. Additionally, we used the CalCEN to identify a new regulator of cell cycle, CCJ1, which we verify contains a DnaJ domain using de novo structure prediction. Although the gene with the highest homology to CCJ1 is SEC63, the C. albicans genome has a SEC63 ortholog which has no overlap in coexpressed proteins with CCJ1. Many DnaJ proteins are cochaperones for the Hsp70 chaperone machinery, and Hsp70 proteins play important roles in regulating yeast cell cycle. Future work on Ccj1-interacting partners will be important for fully defining the mechanisms by which this protein contributes to cell cycle. The additional coexpression partners suggest that this may be through a role in nucleotide metabolism. Overall, we propose that the CalCEN will provide a method for predicting gene function for the C. albicans research community by providing testable hypotheses for experimentation. To assist the research community in using this network, we are integrating the CalCEN into the Candida Genome Database and FungiDB, as well as providing the network here (see Table S3 at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/publication_data_CalCEN_v1_0_0_20201230_tar_gz/13515122).

For example, we used Spearman rank correlation for building the network, we defined arbitrary thresholds when needed (such as the top 1% to compare network overlap), we combined networks by adding network weights, performed guilt by association using neighbor voting, and evaluated retrospective enrichment by using the area under the ROC curve. While more sophisticated methods may give higher predictive accuracy, an advantage of these simplistic methods is that they transparently show how the data lead to the predictions without complex global normalization. Further, the predictive accuracy of the simple methods gives a strong lower bound on the utility of the data. A future direction would be to integrate the CalCEN into multimodal gene function prediction methods that prioritize high accuracy over the top predictions (i.e., optimize the precision recall metric). This can be achieved, for example, through unsupervised network sparsification or supervised machine learning for a given gene function prediction task. In demonstrating the utility of the CalCEN and making the methods and networks available through commonly used databases, we hope to enable their wider use in the fungal pathogenesis community, where the methods can be refined and integrated with additional data sources for gene function prediction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32886, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32908, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Network construction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32930, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "(i) CalCEN.
