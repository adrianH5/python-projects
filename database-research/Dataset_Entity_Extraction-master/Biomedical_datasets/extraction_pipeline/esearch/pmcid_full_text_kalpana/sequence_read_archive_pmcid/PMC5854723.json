Using traditional techniques, mapping causative mutations from forward screens is a lengthy, multi-step process, requiring the identification of a broad genetic region followed by candidate gene sequencing to characterize the causal variant. Mapping by whole genome sequencing accelerates the identification of causal mutations by simultaneously defining a mapping region and providing information on the induced genetic variants. In wheat, although the availability of a high-quality draft genome assembly facilitates mapping and mutation calling, whole genome resequencing remains prohibitively expensive due to its large genome. In the current study, we used exome sequencing as a complexity reduction strategy to detect mutations associated with a target phenotype. In a segregating wheat EMS population, we identified a clear peak region on chromosome arm 4BS associated with increased plant height. Although none of the significant SNPs seemed causative for the mutant phenotype, they were sufficient to identify a linked\u2009~\u20091.9\u00a0Mb deletion encompassing nine genes. These genes included Rht-B1, which is known to have a strong effect on plant height and is a strong candidate for the observed phenotype.

Such screens consist first of isolating a mutant individual exhibiting a phenotype of interest followed by genetic mapping to identify the causal mutation underlying this phenotype. Traditionally, mapping an induced mutation was a lengthy process dependent on identifying genetic markers co-segregating with the target phenotype in a mapping population. A variation of this approach, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) whereby the allelic frequencies of genetic markers are analyzed in two groups of plants exhibiting contrasting phenotypes, can significantly reduce the time and costs of genotyping (Michelmore et al.). Once a mapping interval harboring the causal variant has been defined, candidate genes within this region must be sequenced to identify putative causal mutations underlying the phenotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2943, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies have reduced sequencing costs to such an extent that for many plant species, it is now feasible to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize the full complement of genetic variants within a mutant or a mapping population (Schneeberger). This represents a major advance for genetic mapping studies, since it is possible in a single step to define a mapping interval and identify causal variants associated with the target phenotype (Schneeberger). Mapping-by-sequencing has been widely applied in Arabidopsis thaliana to identify causative mutations underlying phenotypes of interest from screens of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutant populations (Schneeberger et al.; Cuperus et al.; Austin et al.). Typically, mutations are mapped in an F2 population derived from a cross between the isolated mutant line and a genetically divergent accession using a BSA-based approach. To identify the causative mutation, high-throughput sequencing is performed on a bulked DNA sample pooled from F2 individuals exhibiting the mutant phenotype and the relative frequency of each parental allele within the pool is determined using an informatics package (Schneeberger et al.; Cuperus et al.; Austin et al.). Candidate-induced mutations can subsequently be validated using independent allelic mutants (Schneeberger et al.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4332, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Traditional genetic mapping of induced mutants requires the use of crosses between genetically different individuals to maximize the number of polymorphic genetic markers. By contrast, mapping-by-sequencing characterizes all induced mutations within a population, which can be used as markers, precluding the requirement to cross to a genetically divergent variety. Induced mutations can therefore be mapped using an isogenic F2 population developed from a cross between the identified mutant and a non-mutagenized line of the same variety. This reduces both the potentially confounding effect (e.g., epistatic interactions) arising from a heterogeneous genetic background and the number of segregating loci. This approach was originally described in rice (\u2018MutMap\u2019), whereby WGS was conducted on a bulked DNA sample of individuals from an isogenic F2 population which exhibited a mutant phenotype (Abe et al.). Mapping-by-WGS can also be performed without crossing by directly sequencing allelic mutants (Nordstr\u00f6m et al.), or sequencing segregating mutant progenies derived from a heterozygous mutant line (Fekih et al.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5461, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To date, mapping-by-sequencing has predominantly been applied in model plant species such as Arabidopsis and rice, which have well-developed genomic resources (Schneeberger et al.; Cuperus et al.; Austin et al.; Abe et al.; Fekih et al.; Nordstr\u00f6m et al.). The recent release of high-quality reference genomes and annotated gene models for wheat and barley provides the requisite tools to apply mapping-by-sequencing in these crops (Brenchley et al.; the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium; the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium; Chapman et al.; Clavijo et al.). However, despite falling costs, WGS remains prohibitively expensive in wheat and barley due to the high volumes of sequencing data required to provide adequate coverage across their large genomes (the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium; the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium). To overcome this limitation, complexity reduction strategies are required. One such approach is exome capture and sequencing, which dramatically reduces sequencing costs, while ensuring coverage of the vast majority of gene coding regions. In barley, a 62\u00a0Mb (~\u20091.2% of the whole genome) exome capture assay (Mascher et al.) was used to identify variants in protein-coding genes from two phenotypic bulks of an outcrossed F2 population, resulting in the identification of an X-ray-induced deletion of the MANY-NODED DWARF gene responsible for a shortened plastochron phenotype (Mascher et al.). Similarly, a 110\u00a0Mb (~\u20090.6% of the whole genome) exome capture assay in hexaploid wheat was used to identify candidate natural variants at the Yr6 locus responsible for yellow rust resistance from a pooled DNA sample of resistant plants within a doubled haploid population (Gardiner et al.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7255, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Exome sequencing has also been used to facilitate reverse genetic screens by cataloging coding region mutations in EMS-induced TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) populations in wheat (Krasileva et al.). EMS is an alkylating agent that predominantly induces G-to-A nucleotide substitutions that upon DNA replication also generate C-to-T mutations. A custom-designed 84\u00a0Mb capture assay was used to identify over 10\u00a0million high-confidence (<\u20090.2% error rate) EMS-type point mutations in the protein-coding regions of 1535 tetraploid and 1200 hexaploid TILLING lines (Henry et al.; Krasileva et al.). The estimated mutation density of the population was 35\u201340 mutations per kb, providing, on average, 24 nonsynonymous mutations per annotated wheat gene. This analysis also revealed a high frequency of large deletions (scaffolds with at least five deleted exons) in the hexaploid mutant population. Twenty-nine percent of the 1011 analyzed hexaploid mutant lines (293) showed at least one large deletion, whereas no deletions were detected in the 25 sequenced Cadenza control lines (\u03c72 P\u2009=\u20090.0015).

Although the approach we describe is designed to identify point mutations, we demonstrate that this method can also identify deletions. In the presented example, while none of the significant SNPs seemed to be causative for the mutant phenotype, they were sufficient to identify a linked deletion encompassing nine genes. These genes include Rht-B1, which is a strong candidate for the increased height phenotype. Plant height has a strong effect on crop productivity and an improved understanding of the genes underlying this trait will aid the selection of alternative dwarfing alleles in modern wheat germplasm.

To study this mutant line further, we bulk-harvested seeds from the M3 row and sowed them into field conditions as an M4 population (n\u2009=\u200975). Within this population, individual plant heights ranged from 70 to 129\u00a0cm and exhibited a bimodal pattern of segregation (Fig.\u00a01b). Based on this clear segregating phenotype, we decided to use this material to map the causative mutation using an exome capture and sequencing strategy (Fig.\u00a02). The observed pattern of segregation was consistent with a single causative mutation heterozygous in the M2 line. The expected genotype frequency in the M4 population of such a mutation is 37.5% (28 lines) homozygous wild-type, 25.0% (19 lines) heterozygous, and 37.5% (28 lines) homozygous mutant. Based on these expected frequencies, we selected the 24 shortest (average height 82\u00a0cm) and 24 tallest M4 plants (average height 119\u00a0cm) for genotyping (Fig.\u00a01c).

Most non-canonical EMS mutations segregating in the TILLING population are due to residual heterogeneity from the parental non-mutagenized seed stock and are present in multiple individuals (Krasileva et al.).

The P values of the three SNPs located between 27.2 and 31.7\u00a0Mb on chromosome arm 4BS were at least three orders of magnitude lower than the P values detected for the SNPs on other chromosomes (Table\u00a01).

Therefore, we performed PCR to amplify the Rht-B1 gene and its flanking sequences from tall and short sister lines to search for polymorphisms that might not have been included in the exome capture assay or that were missed by our mutation-calling pipeline. In PCR reactions using a pair of primers specific to Rht-B1, we consistently amplified the expected product using template DNA extracted from non-mutagenized Kronos plants and the three shortest sister lines, but all amplifications failed in the three tallest sister lines (Fig.\u00a03a). We then performed PCRs with four additional primer pairs to amplify an overlapping region totaling 4285\u00a0bp, encompassing the complete Rht-B1 coding region, including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs (Wilhelm et al.) and found consistent results (Fig.\u00a03b\u2013e).

However, since the natural rate of deletions in polyploid wheat is relatively high (Dvorak et al.; Dvorak and Akhunov), it is not possible to determine if the identified deletion was caused by EMS or by an EMS-independent mechanism. Our capture assay does not include repetitive regions so we could not precisely establish the borders of the deleted region. However, we were able to determine that this deletion occurs in a chromosomal region that is highly conserved among several Poaceae species (Duan et al.; Wilhelm et al.) and harbors at least nine annotated genes including wheat orthologs of TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (TB1, TraesCS4B01G042700), a C3HC4-Type RING Finger (TraesCS4B01G042900) and Rht-B1 (TraesCS4B01G043100, Table\u00a02). To identify which of these genes is causative for the increased height phenotype, it will be necessary to characterize independent knockout mutants for each of the deleted genes. This process will be facilitated by the in silico TILLING databases (Krasileva et al.). A screen of this database revealed that for seven of the nine genes, individuals carrying mutations that introduce premature stop codons or that disrupt splice sites are available (Online Resource Table S4). Among these mutants, we identified one tetraploid line carrying a mutation encoding a premature stop codon in Rht-B1 (W424* in line T4-3545, Online Resource Table S4).

This suggests that the deletion of Rht-B1 is the most likely explanation for the results observed in the mutant reported in this study. The wheat variety Kronos carries the gain-of-function Rht-B1b allele that encodes a constitutively active repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling which confers a semi-dwarf phenotype (Peng et al.), and therefore, its deletion is expected to generate taller plants. In a large suppressor screen for tall mutants in a wheat variety carrying the dwarf Rht-B1c allele, more than 150 independent tall mutant lines carried deletions of various sizes that all included Rht-B1 (Chandler and Harding; Miraghazadeh et al.). In addition, the T4-3822 mutant showed restored GA sensitivity at the seedling stage (Online Resource Fig. S6), providing additional indirect evidence that the deletion of Rht-B1 in T4-3822 is causative for the increased height phenotype. However, since there is evidence linking the deleted TB1 and members of the C3HC4-Type RING Finger family to differences in plant height in other species (Lewis et al.; Wu et al.), we cannot rule out their contribution to the differences in plant height.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44401, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44413, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Using exome sequencing in a small segregating M4-induced mutant population, we identified a 1.9\u00a0Mb deletion responsible for an increased height phenotype in wheat.
