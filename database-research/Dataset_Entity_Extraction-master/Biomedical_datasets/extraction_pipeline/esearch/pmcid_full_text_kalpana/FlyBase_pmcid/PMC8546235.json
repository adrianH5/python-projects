The GO Consortium provides a gold-standard bioinformatics resource used for analysis and interpretation of large biomedical data sets. However, the GO is also used by other research communities and, therefore, must meet a variety of demands on the breadth and depth of information that is provided. To meet the needs of the Alzheimer\u2019s research community we have focused on the GO annotation of the BBB, with over 100 transport or junctional proteins prioritized for annotation. This project has led to a substantial increase in the number of human proteins associated with BBB-relevant GO terms as well as more comprehensive annotation of these proteins in many other processes. Furthermore, data describing the microRNAs that regulate the expression of these priority proteins have also been curated.

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying AD are unknown, considerable research has implicated amyloid beta (A\u03b2) accumulation to be the primary pathological feature, with other processes, such as chronic brain inflammation and cell death, contributing to disease progression. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a highly specialized system consisting of brain microvascular endothelial cells. The close interaction of the microvasculature with components of the neurovascular unit, such as pericytes and astrocytes, supplies nutrients to the brain tissue, whilst simultaneously shielding it from toxic substances. In addition, the BBB ensures the removal of metabolites and harmful compounds from the brain into the bloodstream. To carry out and maintain these processes, transport across the BBB is limited physically, via cell junction proteins, and metabolically, through a diverse number of selective transporter proteins. A dysfunctional BBB has been implicated in AD in a number of ways including, but not limited to, a failure of removing A\u03b2 from the brain. In addition, although recent research has suggested an association between A\u03b2 accumulation and chronic inflammation, it appears that a breakdown at the BBB also can contribute to chronic inflammation and consequently neurodegeneration. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated BBB dysfunction in AD, as well as in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3064, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Current research is using a variety of high-throughput methodologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics and genome-wide association studies to investigate neurological diseases. To aid navigation and analyses of high-throughput data sets in an efficient way, researchers rely on bioinformatics resources, such as the Gene Ontology (GO). The GO has two major components: ontology and annotations. The ontology consists of GO terms and the relationships that exist between them. GO terms are descriptive statements that can be applied to biological entities to capture their cellular locations (e.g. \u2018plasma membrane\u2019), molecular functions (e.g. \u2018amino acid transmembrane transporter activity\u2019) and the wider biological processes they contribute to (e.g. \u2018amino acid transmembrane transport\u2019). Annotations connect a biological entity to a GO term in the ontology, thus allowing for a statement to be made about the entity\u2019s biological role and cellular location.

GO annotations can overcome this problem, as information about a biological entity can be condensed, making biological knowledge more accessible in both human- and computer-readable formats. Scientists can access summaries of the biological role and cellular location of individual gene products from bioinformatics resources such as QuickGO, AmiGO, UniProt, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene and Ensembl.

the use of expression data to support the creation of new annotations for human gene products. During the review of the experimental data describing BBB located proteins, it was apparent that very few experiments confirm that a protein located at the BBB is involved in the normal function of the BBB. With the result that only 28 of the current human annotations are supported by direct experimental data, with 38 annotations supported by model organism experimental data. Consequently, the majority of the BBB-specific GO annotations are supported by specific author statements, such as those by Sweeney et\u00a0al., which describe the role of BBB-located proteins in BBB processes. Almost 100 human proteins only have author statement support for their association with BBB-relevant GO terms.

However, for more specific terms, such as \u2018ion transmembrane transport\u2019, \u2018lipid transport\u2019 and \u2018import across plasma membrane\u2019, the number of priority proteins associated with these terms has increased from 44, 14 and 16 to 64, 25 and 35, respectively (Table 2).

The use of UniProt IDs for human mRNAs supports a more user-friendly GO enrichment analysis of Cytoscape networks.

Thus, the network was seeded with 27 UniProtKB protein IDs, which included 12 of the priority junctional proteins and 15 non-priority proteins.

This focused annotation project has identified that, while GO provides information about the general role and cellular location for many proteins, essential processes required for normal human development and cellular activities are still under-represented. At the start of this work only five human proteins were associated with a BBB-specific GO term; currently 124 proteins are associated with these specific terms, This under-representation may reflect the reluctance of the GO Consortium to consider the cellular (or tissue) location of a protein as sufficient evidence that the protein is contributing to processes that are specific to that cell or tissue. It is well known that the BBB plays an essential role in regulating the transport of nutrients and toxic substances to and from the brain. This transport is undertaken by the activity of specific channels and transporters but is also impeded by the close connections between the microvascular endothelial cells, mediated by junctional and adhesion proteins. However, experiments verifying the role of a protein in maintaining the BBB or facilitating transport have not been conducted for many proteins that are considered to function in this location. Rather it is assumed that, for example, an adhesion molecule which is present at the BBB is likely to be involved in maintenance of the BBB. Despite a thorough review of the literature, experimental evidence describing the role of only 26 human proteins, or their orthologs, at the BBB was identified and curated. Consequently, author statements supported the association of 82 human proteins with BBB-specific GO terms. However, these annotations have been created, despite the general GO Consortium policy of avoiding the use of expression data or author statements to support annotations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36338, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several reasons why the GO Consortium advocates avoiding the use of author statements and expression data. The location of expression of a protein is not considered sufficiently strong evidence for its role in a cell-specific process, such as \u2018transport across blood-brain barrier\u2019. In theory, the expression level may be so low that the contribution of the protein to the process may be negligible or the protein may be synthesized in one cell but active in another. Avoiding the curation of expression data, therefore, reduces the possibility of creating errors in the annotation files. The reason for avoiding the curation of author statements is twofold. Firstly, the authors may be basing their statements on experimental data for an orthologous gene without evidence that the gene has the same role in the species being described. Instead, biocurators are encouraged to identify the original data and curate that appropriately. The second reason is probably the one that carries the most weight. The GO Consortium has established several approaches to \u2018automatically\u2019 propagate annotations from one protein to its family members in the same or different species. However, these annotations are only propagated when the original annotations are supported by experimental data. Consequently, the annotations created by this project based on author statements will not be automatically propagated to orthologs in other species by these methods. Thus, currently there are only 82 and 52 BBB-specific GO annotations associated with 51 and 38 mouse and rat proteins, respectively. As these species are commonly used as model organisms in neurodegenerative research, the progress we have made in curating the human BBB is unlikely to benefit this community. While the GO Consortium guidelines help reduce the errors in the annotation files and maximize the propagation of annotations across thousands of species, this policy may be contributing to the lack of curation of some areas of biological knowledge.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38363, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is very common for revisions to the ontology to be instigated following a focused annotation project, as biocurators test the applicability of the terms to describe the current biological knowledge. This was indeed the case during this focused annotation project, where several problems were identified in the biological process and cellular component ontologies. These problems were corrected through the merging and obsoletion of terms, by rearranging some terms within the ontology and creating 10 new terms. While these revisions confirm that the ontology structure is still likely to require further modifications, the limited number of changes required suggests that the number of ontology errors has substantially decreased over the past decade.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39119, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To meet the needs of the various research communities that use GO, the GO Consortium are changing the annotation practice from the simple association of GO terms with individual gene products, to more complex approaches. The annotation extension field provides a limited opportunity to extend the meaning of the associated GO term through, for example, the specification of the tissue or cell type that the gene product is active in or the target entity of the specified function. Unfortunately very few tools have been adapted to exploit the annotation extension information. The new GO-Causal Activity Model (GO-CAM) is being developed to graphically describe the intricate network of gene products and pathways that lead to the completion of a specific pathway. The GO-CAM data are not only available in the graph format but are also incorporated within the standard GO association (annotation) files. While text mining approaches to curate the vast volume of published data are often proposed as a more efficient way to address the expensive and time-consuming current manual curation approach, it is difficult to foresee how the complexity of data currently captured by both the simple and more complex GO annotations can be accurately extracted without manual review. Research has shown that focused annotation projects, such as this, can lead to biases in the results obtained following enrichment analyses of transcriptomic or proteomic data sets, which leads some researchers to \u2018cherry pick\u2019 the data they present. However, this BBB-focused project has improved the association of non-BBB-specific GO terms with the prioritized proteins through comprehensive annotation of the available literature. Many human proteins have roles in a variety of different cell types and tissues; therefore, our annotations will contribute to the interpretation of future studies interrogating genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics data sets relevant to many cells and tissues, other than, and including, those relevant to the BBB. It is now important for researchers using gene annotation data from GO and other resources, such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome, to understand how to appropriately interpret their functional analysis. Researchers need to recognize that the same proteins have similar roles in multiple, but different, developmental and signalling pathways and that a protein involved in transport at the BBB is likely to be functioning as a transporter in other tissues too.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41641, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The comparison of functional analyses conducted using GO annotation files available in 2019 and 2021 demonstrates that many GO annotations have remained relatively stable and do provide a good overview of the role of the majority of human proteins. However, the impact of this BBB-focused project confirms that more work is still needed to fully describe the role of human gene products in processes that occur only in specific tissues or organs. With the increasing evidence of a role of non-coding RNAs in some disease processes, the curation of these gene products also requires additional work. In our analysis of the 26 miRNAs captured as regulators of 12 junctional proteins (Figure 5), 15 of these miRNAs are not associated with a cell-junction-relevant GO term. This may be due to a lack of experimental data supporting their role in this process or may reflect a need for further curation of these miRNAs. Funding constraints prevented the annotations of the experimental data that described miRNA regulation of the priority proteins involved in transport at the BBB. This project was focused on curation of the role of only 105 proteins, and yet our approach to fully curate each reviewed paper has led to 124 proteins now being associated with a BBB-specific GO term, suggesting that the knowledge of BBB is not fully curated. Furthermore, this work has identified that the specific targets of many of the transporters this project curated had not previously been available in the GO annotation files, nor had the direction or location of transport.
