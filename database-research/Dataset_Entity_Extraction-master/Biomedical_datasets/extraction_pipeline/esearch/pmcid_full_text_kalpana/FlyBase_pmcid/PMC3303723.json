The proportion of DNA that codes for proteins is greatly reduced in eukaryotes, but the number of ways in which the coding blocks called exons are combined to form new proteins is surprisingly large. During transcription, intervening sequences (introns) in pre-mRNA molecules are spliced out by the spliceosome machinery and then exons are joined together to form mature mRNA molecules. Alternative splicing occurs when the exons of the RNA molecules produced by transcription of a gene are reconnected in multiple ways. Little is known about why one exon is chosen over another under specific circumstances. Pairs of exons that are never included together in the final mRNA transcript are called mutually exclusive (ME) exons. During the processing of pre-mRNA transcripts, accurate discrimination of exons and introns requires additional regulatory elements in addition to splice site (SS) signals at the 5'- and 3'-ends of exons. These conserved motifs have been termed exonic and intronic splicing regulatory sequences (ESRs/ISRs) because they occur in the exons or introns of a gene sequence and can be subdivided into exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs/ISEs) and exonic and intronic splicing silencers (ESSs/ISSs) that activate or repress splicing, respectively.

We looked at sequences with 100% nucleotide conservation, but found no hexamers among the cassette exons that appeared at high frequency and many conserved sequences were found to be part of highly conserved regions within the exons.

The FDR correction process resulted in 218 motifs with either a left side or right side corrected p-value < 0.05, but only 1 motif with both left and right corrected p-values < 0.05. The reason for this is that t-tests for a sample size of 6 will produce higher p-values leading to fewer significant motifs when a correction is applied. Among the 83 elements in the uncorrected list, we found five genes and among the 218 motifs in the corrected list we found 11 genes whose ME exons had putative ESRs that differed from ESRs in the other paired ME exons. It is believed that recognition of ESRs in the ME exons drives expression of mutually exclusive exons in a tissue-specific manner. Unfortunately there is little information in the literature about the tissue-specific expression patterns of alternatively spliced isoforms of Drosophila genes, but we found information that linked certain genes to differing spatiotemporal expression. The gene Zasp functions in the formation of integrin adhesion sites and is active during different stages of development. At late embryonic stages, Zasp expression is particularly strong in mesodermal tissues such as visceral, pharyngeal, and somatic muscles. Doa is expressed in ectoderm and mesoderm during early embryonic stages and in nervous system during late embryonic stages. SR and SR-like proteins can be phosphorylated by Doa.
