Researchers need to be able to rapidly and intuitively query these data, and the QuickSearch tool has been designed to meet these needs. This tool is conveniently located on the FlyBase homepage and is organized into a series of simple tabbed interfaces that cover the major data and annotation classes within the database.

Second, the tab allows a direct search of Human Disease Model Reports, which have been produced by FlyBase for those specific diseases for which Drosophila serves as a model. These reports include a summary of the human disease and implicated gene(s), information about the D. melanogaster model, and links to related data in FlyBase and at external sites, such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). A specific disease may be modeled by expressing a human transgene in flies and/or by manipulating the fly ortholog(s), and this format integrates these data into a single report.
