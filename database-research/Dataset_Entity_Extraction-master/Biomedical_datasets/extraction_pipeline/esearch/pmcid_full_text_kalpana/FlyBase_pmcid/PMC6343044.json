GO-based searches performed better than EC-based searches, as reflected in their respective recall scores, indicating that GO annotation provides better coverage of enzyme annotation compared to EC annotation, at least for this data set. We also probed the reasons why certain ligases were missed in our original sources (Table 5). As observed for false positives, the underlying explanations for false negatives are various and affect the sources differently. The two major reasons were changes to relationships within the GO itself (that affected the number of hits obtained from a query with the parent `ligase activity\u2019 term), and uncurated functional information in the published literature.

The summary statistics presented for the four enzyme groups reviewed to date (Table 2) demonstrate the extent of the improvements and the effectiveness of our strategy. An important finding was that no single database/search strategy provided the full enzyme set prior to our review\u2014data from several sources needed to be synthesized and integrated to generate a comprehensive set, and many of the errors/omissions we uncovered would have been missed using more restricted or piecemeal approaches.

The two major reasons for these differences were determined to be database asynchrony and the different policies/pipelines implemented in different resources for showing functional annotations. For example, the majority of D. melanogaster EC data in NCBI and UniProtKB/TrEMBL are based on FlyBase GO annotations (via the GO-to-EC mapping FlyBase computes in its annual submission to GenBank), but may be a year or more out of sync with current GO data; QuickGO includes UniProtKB electronic GO annotation pipelines that are not present in FlyBase. Although these explanations are reasonable and, to some extent, unavoidable, all databases should make more effort to clearly document and display the provenance of the GO/EC data they display, including the version/date of any third-party data they import. That said, there is also a need to educate database users that any single resource may not provide a complete and accurate search result. For example, we determined that our initial query of QuickGO for D. melanogaster ligases had a precision and recall of 0.73 and 0.83, respectively, indicating a significant number of erroneous and missing entries.
