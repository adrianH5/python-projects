We define an annotation as the biological evaluation and explanation of a specific region on a nucleic acid sequence that includes, but is not limited to, gene transcripts.

Similarly gene-prediction programs can generate quite different results depending on the length of the genomic sequence analyzed and the gene density of the surrounding sequence. Even systems that strive to make adjustments and collate the results of all the analyses are unable to consistently provide accurate biological models (see for a more detailed discussion).

However, we are not yet at the stage where we can make intelligent use of all the existing data automatically. Resolving the conflicts that exist between EST evidence, BLAST similarities and computational predictions can be extremely complicated and is still best done by manual inspection. The simplifications that existing automated annotation pipelines must make lead to a number of systematic errors, including under- or over-predicting genes as well as merging the exons from two genes in one gene model or splitting the exons from one gene into two gene models. For example, if the software discounts unspliced EST evidence (a common simplification made to reduce the effect of errors in EST databases), small genes can easily be omitted. In addition, issues such as determining alternative transcripts, understanding promoter usage, identifying polyadenylation sites, distinguishing genes within the intron of another gene, and recognizing dicistronic genes, are all outstanding problems in the annotation of protein-coding genes. Yet, as more genomes become available, we cannot hope to provide a high level of manual examination and correction to describe the genes present on these genomes precisely.

There are seven tiers (or rows) of data presented here in the results panel (the number of tiers is configurable). On the forward strand from top to bottom these results are promoter predictions (yellow), P-element insertions (turquoise triangles), peptide homologies to other species (orange), peptide homologies to Drosophila (red), Drosophila EST alignments (light green), Drosophila mRNA alignments (bright and dark green) and gene prediction results (lavender).

Each feature's shape, visibility, color and panel position is configurable. The result panel can display the complete portfolio of computational results. The top three rows of this figure use small vertical green lines to indicate the position of start codons in the genomic sequence in all three possible translation frames. The second set of three rows does the same for stop codons (red). This enables curators to easily discern ORFs. Beneath this, in orange, are BLASTX hits to other species. Every row represents a separate alignment in this expanded view (see Figure 3 for a discussion of the expanded view). In each alignment the high-scoring pairs (HSP) are separated by two parallel lines to indicate alignment gaps. Seeing what features share edges is important during annotation for adjusting exon-intron boundaries. When an item is selected, corresponding edges of other items that end at the same nucleotide are highlighted with a white line (arrow A). The small turquoise triangle indicates the site of a P-element insertion. The rows of light green rectangles are Sim4 alignments of Drosophila ESTs to the genome. When a 5' and a 3' EST are derived from the same cDNA clone we connect them with a dashed line (arrow B). This contrasts with the solid lines used to represent the gaps, corresponding to introns, introduced into an EST to permit its alignment to the genome. The final piece of computational evidence shown in this figure is the gene prediction, shown in lavender. In this example, we have intentionally represented introns in two different ways - as straight or peaked lines - as an illustration of Apollo's configurable graphics. In the annotation panel, the curator has created two alternative transcripts for this gene, each of which is supported by multiple pieces of EST evidence. Individual exons that the curator has selected are outlined in yellow. The translation start and stop sites are shown as green and red vertical lines, respectively. Each individual curator has a signature color; any annotation that this particular curator creates is shown in bright blue.

One of the viewing options is whether the features within that tier are 'collapsed' or 'expanded'. In the collapsed view (top) features lie on top of one another and thus appear along a single line. In this view the EST alignments (shown in light green) are collapsed. In the expanded view (below) the tier disallows overlapping features and thus as many lines as needed are used. The individual EST alignments (one line per EST) now appear separately.

The Apollo data models fall into one of two broad categories (or are a descriptive auxiliary class, for example, Comment): (a) a location on a sequence; or (b) a sequence. The corresponding Java superclasses are Range and AbstractSequence, respectively. The inheritance hierarchy from these two central classes is shown here, but some minor classes and relationships are omitted to simplify this description. Each class or interface is drawn as a rectangle, and interfaces have the suffix 'I' included in their class name (an interface specifies the methods that the class is required to implement). Lines ending with an open-headed arrow-point indicate the superclass and subclass relationships and a dotted line connects an interface to a class that implements that interface. Thus, both GenomicRange and SeqFeature are subclasses of the base class Range (which implements the Range I interface) and in turn FeatureSet, GenericAnnotation, FeaturePair, and AssemblyFeature are specializations of SeqFeature. Similarly an SRSSequence is a subclass of AbstractLazySequence, which in turn is a subclass AbstractSequence. Each of these subclasses inherits all the methods of their parent class and may extend the model's behavior either by adding new methods or by overriding the inherited methods. In addition to inheritance, the connecting lines also depict other types of relationships, with the terminus indicating the potential cardinality. Thus, a GenericAnnotationSet must have at least one, but may possibly have more, pieces of Evidence associated with it (drawn as a single crossbar to indicate 'at least one' and a triangular tripod to represent 'many'), one Identifier, which maintains synonyms and database cross references (a single crossbar indicates 'one and only one'), and may have zero or more optional Comments (drawn as a triangular tripod to represent 'many' and a single circle to indicate 'none'). Thus, a FeatureSet is both itself a SeqFeature that is composed of one or more component SeqFeatures. This enables Transcripts to be composed of a set of Exons, or an alignment to be composed of a set of high-scoring pairs. Likewise a CurationSet (across two different species) may contain component CurationSets (for the individual species) to enable comparative analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}]
