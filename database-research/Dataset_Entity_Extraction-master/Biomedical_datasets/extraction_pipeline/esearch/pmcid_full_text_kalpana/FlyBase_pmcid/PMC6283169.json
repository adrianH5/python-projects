B chromosomes were recently identified in a laboratory stock of Drosophila melanogaster\u2014an established model organism with a wealth of genetic and genomic resources\u2014enabling us to subject them to extensive molecular analysis. We isolated the B chromosomes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and determined their composition through next-generation sequencing. Although these B chromosomes carry no known euchromatic sequence, they are rich in transposable elements and long arrays of short nucleotide repeats, the most abundant being the uncharacterized AAGAT satellite repeat. Fluorescent in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosome spreads revealed this repeat is located on chromosome 4, strongly suggesting the origin of the B chromosomes is chromosome 4. Cytological and quantitative comparisons of signal intensity between chromosome 4 and the B chromosomes supports the hypothesis that the structure of the B chromosome is an isochromosome. We also report the identification of a new B chromosome variant in a related laboratory stock. This B chromosome has a similar repeat signature as the original but is smaller and much less prevalent. We examined additional stocks with similar genotypes and did not find B chromosomes, but did find these stocks lacked the AAGAT satellite repeat.

The recent rise of genomic analysis has allowed B chromosomes from several species to be examined on a molecular level, revealing more about their potential origin and genetic composition. For instance, the sequencing of rye (Secale cereal) B chromosomes demonstrated they arose just over 1 MYA and are derived from fragments of multiple A chromosomes. The B chromosomes in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia latifasciata were sequenced and found to carry euchromatic sequence\u2014some of which is transcriptionally active\u2014that is also present on several of the A chromosomes. More recently, sequencing the B chromosome of the grasshopper Eumigus monticola indicated that while it likely arose from one of the A chromosomes, it has since undergone amplification, and deep sequencing in another grasshopper, Eyprepocnemis plorans, revealed the presence of 10 protein-coding genes carried on the B chromosome.

Second, the inability to control breeding and environment has the potential to introduce uncontrolled genetic variation and unknown pressure on B chromosome evolution, leading to fluctuations in B chromosome variants, frequency, and transmission rates. Third, it is challenging to precisely determine the age of a B chromosome in these wild systems, making it difficult to discern how they formed and what events led to their current composition.

Focusing on the apparent duplication of the AAGAT satellite repeat on the B chromosomes as compared to chromosome 4, we propose the D. melanogaster B chromosome is an isochromosome that formed after a centromeric misdivision event on chromosome 4 (see Discussion).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 40314, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Identification of a second B chromosome variant", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 40362, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, we began examining the progenitor of the mtrm126 stock that is retained in our laboratory.

In a few of our samples from this stock, the metaphase chromosome spreads included a small DAPI-staining fragment that was reminiscent of a B chromosome. To determine if this DNA fragment had a similar repeat composition as the B chromosome, we performed FISH on metaphase spreads using probes for repeat sequences that are enriched on the B chromosome, revealing that this small DNA fragment carries each of them (Figure 5A and Figure S3). Since this DNA fragment was not present in every sample we examined, we speculated it may lack essential chromosome components such as a centromere and/or telomeres, thus affecting its ability to be efficiently transmitted to progeny. Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence on metaphase spreads from the mtrmKG08051 stock and found that this element carries both the CID and HOAP antigens, suggesting that it possesses both centromeres and telomeres, respectively (Figure 5B).

To directly compare the two B chromosomes to each other as well as to the same chromosome 4, a male carrying the B1 chromosome was crossed to a female carrying the B2 chromosome. Progeny from this cross would possess both B chromosomes, enabling their direct comparison since they are within the same metaphase (Figure 6A) (we should note that the quantitative comparisons between the B1 chromosome and chromosome 4 in Figure 4D were performed on the same metaphases, therefore the chromosome 4 used for comparison here is identical). Comparing the AAGAT FISH signal intensity on the B2 chromosome to chromosome 4 demonstrates that they have an equal amount of FISH signal (Figure 6B; see Materials and Methods). This result is consistent with our observation that the B2 chromosome has fewer FISH foci than the B1 chromosome (Figure 6C). Since both B chromosome variants carry a similar suite of satellite repeats and are likely similar in their DNA composition, we used their DAPI staining intensity to relatively compare their DNA content. We found that the B2 chromosome is 65% as bright as the B1 chromosome, suggesting the B2 chromosome has less DNA content overall and is likely smaller in total length than the B1 chromosome (Figure 6D; see Materials and Methods).

To determine if any of these three lines also carry a B chromosome and at what frequency, we examined them cytologically and looked for small DAPI-staining fragments. Although previous chromosome spreads described here were made from larval neuroblast tissue, for this analysis we chose to use ovarian tissue from adult females to quickly assess how many, if any, breeding adults carried B chromosomes within each of the stocks. We began by examining the mtrmKG08051 line that we know carries the B2 chromosome to determine its frequency within the stock. We found that 9 out of 25 adult females carried one copy of the B2 chromosome and two females carried two copies of the B2 chromosome, indicating its frequency within the stock is very low (Figure S4A). We then examined females from the other three stocks using the same technique and included the AATAT FISH probe in our chromosome spread processing since it is enriched on both the B1 and B2 chromosomes. Interestingly, after examining at least 30 females from each stock, we did not detect a supernumerary DAPI-staining fragment (Figure S4, B\u2013E).

First, though these three stocks were acquired from separate collections, they are genotypic copies of our laboratory mtrmKG08051 stock that clearly carries the AAGAT satellite repeat (Figure 7A) and therefore we expected them to be similar. Second, since the AAGAT satellite repeat was abundant in two separate genomic studies, we were surprised to not detect any blocks of AAGAT satellite repeat in these three stocks. To validate our original observation, we repeated the FISH experiment on neuroblast chromosome spreads from males (to also assay the Y chromosome) using both the AAGAT and AATAT probes simultaneously. Consistent with our initial results, we observed FISH signal with the AATAT probe but not the AAGAT probe in these three stocks (Figure 7, B\u2013D).

It has been demonstrated in wheat that the formation of isochromosomes from univalent (unpaired) chromosomes through a centromeric misdivision event is quite frequent during meiotic divisions. Such an event may have the opportunity to occur more often in a mtrm mutant background due to an increased frequency of chromosome 4 aneuploidy within the stock, a result of its frequent missegregation during female meiosis. Females carrying an extra copy of chromosome 4 would produce a univalent during meiosis, which may be more susceptible to centromeric misdivision.
