This rise in number of VUS creates major challenges for genetic counseling. Additionally, fewer individual variants in known genes are being published as the academic merit is decreasing, and most testing now happens in clinical laboratories, which typically do not correlate their variants with clinical phenotypes. For CMT, we aim to encourage and facilitate the global capture of variant data to gain a large collection of alleles in CMT genes, ideally in conjunction with phenotypic information. The Inherited Neuropathy Variant Browser provides user-friendly open access to currently reported variation in CMT genes. Geneticists, physicians, and genetic counselors can enter variants detected by clinical tests or in research studies in addition to genetic variation gathered from published literature, which are then submitted to ClinVar bi-annually.
