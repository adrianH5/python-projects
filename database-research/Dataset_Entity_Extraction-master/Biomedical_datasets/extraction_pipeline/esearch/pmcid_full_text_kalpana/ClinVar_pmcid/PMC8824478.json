Functional characterization of CDKN2A VUSs is needed to reclassify variants and inform clinical management. Twenty-nine germline CDKN2A VUSs previously reported in patients with PDAC or in ClinVar were evaluated using a validated in vitro cell proliferation assay. Twelve of the 29 CDKN2A VUSs were functionally deleterious (11 VUSs) or potentially functionally deleterious (1 VUS) and were reclassified as likely pathogenic variants. Thus, over 40% of CDKN2A VUSs identified in patients with PDAC are functionally deleterious and likely pathogenic. When incorporating VUSs found to be functionally deleterious, and reclassified as likely pathogenic, the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic CDKN2A in patients with PDAC reported in the published literature is increased to up to 4.1% of patients, depending on family history.

The International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS) Consortium trials found that surveillance identified either PDAC or a high-grade precursor lesion in 6.8% of HRIs, including relatives of patients with familial pancreatic cancer and individuals with a pathogenic germline variant in a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene, during a median follow-up 5.6 years (24 of 354 individuals).

Importantly, the overall resection rate and 5-year survival rate was 75% and 24%, respectively. Furthermore, patients with PDAC and a pathogenic germline variant in a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene may have cancers that are uniquely sensitive to specific anti-cancer therapies, as is the case for poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors and immunotherapy.
