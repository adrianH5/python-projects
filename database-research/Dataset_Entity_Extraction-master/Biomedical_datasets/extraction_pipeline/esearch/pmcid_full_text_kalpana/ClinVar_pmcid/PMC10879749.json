Complex events, such as repeat expansion variants, are less frequent but can be of high clinical importance. They are represented in a multitude of ways in ClinVar, particularly HGVS notation, which is able to capture complexities like imprecise locations and variable number of repeats. CMAT processes both the HGVS notation and the variant coordinates where present and separates variants according to their type. Repeat expansion variants are annotated as trinucleotide or short tandem repeat expansions based on the length of the repeating element, and the affected gene is determined based on location. Large insertions and deletions with precise locations are provided to VEP using the appropriate structural variant type indication.
