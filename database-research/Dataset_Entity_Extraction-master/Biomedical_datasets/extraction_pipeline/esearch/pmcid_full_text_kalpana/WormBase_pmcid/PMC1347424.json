We also redesigned WormBase so that its software and data releases are packaged for easy uploading and updating. This allowed us to construct and maintain several mirror sites at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (Crete, Greece), the California Institute of Technology, and the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (Daejeon, South Korea). It also allows us to run WormBase on laptop computers for network-independent use and efficient software development.
