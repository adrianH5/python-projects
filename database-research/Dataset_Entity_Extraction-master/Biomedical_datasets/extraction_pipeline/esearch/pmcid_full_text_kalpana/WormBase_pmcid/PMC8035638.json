An increase in the global consumption of potatoes, stimulated through rising populations and intensifying urbanization, has driven a surge in potato production (Birch et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012). However, production is still adversely affected by pests and pathogens, including the potato cyst nematodes (PCN) Globodera rostochiensis and G.\u00a0pallida. While these species can infect numerous species of Solanum, they are, in economic terms, principally parasites of potatoes (Whitehead,\u00a01985).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2929, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Potato cyst nematodes originated in South America, where they coevolved with their solanaceous host plants. Although potato was first brought to Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, it is likely that PCN were introduced from South America in the mid\u20101800s on material for breeding resistance against Phytophthora infestans following the Irish potato famine (Evans et\u00a0al.,\u00a01975). Genetic studies of PCN populations from across the world indicate that a relatively limited number of introductions of PCN into Europe have occurred (Blok et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997; Hockland et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012), with considerably greater genetic diversity in South American populations than those in Europe (Grenier et\u00a0al.,\u00a02001). Analysis of mitochondrial cytB sequences of populations from Europe and South America identified a region in southern Peru from where the three distinct introductions of G.\u00a0pallida in Europe are likely to have originated (Plantard et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008). Europe has subsequently acted as a secondary distribution centre for PCN, most likely due to distribution of contaminated seed potato material (Hockland et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012). Consistent with this, genotyping of populations occurring outside Europe shows \u201ctypical\u201d European population types rather than exotic types from the centre of origin (e.g., Pylypenko et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4255, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The damage that PCN causes, and the huge difficulty in eradicating PCN once it is established in the field, have led to the implementation of strict quarantine regulations across many parts of the world that aim to contain and prevent the further spread of PCN. For example, within the EU, Council Directive 2000/29/EC permits member states to adopt quarantine measures that prevent the spread of PCN, while EU Council Directive 2007/33/EC describes measures for the control and management of PCN. More recently, this legislation has been updated with the implementation regulation 2016/2031 on Plant Health. Similarly, in North America, CIFA (Canada) and USDA\u2010APHIS (USA) developed guidelines on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures in accordance with the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organization Agreement. Soil samples are routinely collected and, on detection of PCN, movement of soil and crops (present and historic) from infected and adjacent fields is monitored and regulated until viable PCN are no longer detected. Infected land may not be used for host crop production unless PCN management plans are in place. Meanwhile in Australia, PCN biosecurity zones were established following detection of PCN in 1986 in Western Australia and in 1991 in Victoria. In New South Wales, biosecurity zones have been established to protect seed potato areas. Monitoring of this zone restricts import of potato propagative material, packaging, soil, and machinery from outside the area (Biosecurity Order 2017). Similarly, G.\u00a0rostochiensis was identified in New York state in the USA in the 1940s but an aggressive programme of survey, quarantine, and deployment of resistant cultivars containing the H1 gene have prevented further spread of this nematode (Evans & Brodie,\u00a01980). Strict local and national import measures have led to the localized eradication of PCN though surveillance programmes continue to monitor for PCN. However, despite such stringent measures, new outbreaks of PCN are regularly reported, including in regions that are heavily dependent on potato production. For example, G.\u00a0pallida was reported from Idaho in the USA, which is among the most important potato\u2010growing regions in the USA (Hafez et\u00a0al.,\u00a02007), necessitating major efforts to contain and eradicate this outbreak (e.g., Contina et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020). However, of potentially even greater significance is the discovery of PCN in a number of sub\u2010Saharan African countries (Cortada et al., 2020; Mwangi et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015; Niragire et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6837, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Potato is a crop of key importance in East Africa and the second most important crop after maize in many countries in the region (CIP,\u00a02019). It is grown both as a cash crop and for food security. However, yields have precipitously declined in recent years to around 9\u201310\u00a0tonnes/ha (Kiptoo et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016), considerably below the yield potential of this crop. Such yield losses are likely to be at least partly attributable to disease pressure. PCN (G.\u00a0rostochiensis) was first reported from the region in Kenya (Mwangi et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015) and subsequently shown to be widespread across the country, in over 80% of potato\u2010growing areas (Mburu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020), with G.\u00a0pallida present in a small number of locations (Mburu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018, 2020). Subsequent surveys have identified G.\u00a0rostochiensis in Rwanda (Niragire et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019) and Uganda (Cortada et al., 2020), indicating a more region\u2010wide problem. Potato is cultivated in alignment with the two rainy seasons that occur each year, and mostly by smallholder farmers, who practise little or no rotation. These growing conditions, coupled with the fact that the most popular cultivars have no resistance against PCN, has proven ideal for PCN population densities to build up to extremely damaging levels; over 150 viable eggs per gram of soil have been recorded at multiple sites, while infestation levels that are considered low have around 30 viable eggs per gram of soil (Mburu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020). These infestation levels compare with fewer than 10 eggs per gram of soil in the UK, found in over 60% of infested fields (Minnis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02002). Such high population levels are resulting in major yield losses and crop failures (Figure\u00a01a; Mburu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020), with impacts at multiple levels. For example, persistent low yields push farmers to move to new land for potato production, opening up new fields even from forested areas. This food insecurity leads to deforestation therefore, as farmers shift from land deemed as unproductive (Figure\u00a01b), with consequent environmental impact as forests are removed to make way for potato production.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8949, "infons": {"file": "MPP-22-495-g004.jpg", "id": "mpp13047-fig-0001", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "(a) Damage to potato crop in Kenya.

In addition, biological control methods, such as the use of antagonistic microbial agents, have been assessed and employed but are not widely used against PCN (reviewed by Davies et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018). Few natural enemies of PCN have been identified and mass production of these is technically challenging (Kerry & Hominick, 2002; Viaene et al., 2006). No single strategy can be relied upon as none thus far is completely effective against both species. Many of the chemical nematicides previously used against PCN have also since been removed from the market due to their potential adverse environmental and human health concerns (Turner & Rowe, 2006). Just a few nematicides remain, such as Vydate (oxamyl) and Nemathorin (fosthiazate), although new chemistries are emerging onto the market that may prove effective with fewer nontarget consequences. The application of synthetic nematicide protects yield but results in significant additional costs to growers. In addition, timing of application needs to be carefully calculated in order for them to be effective. Cultural strategies attempt to limit the impact of PCN through improved agricultural practices. These may include extended rotations between potato crops to exploit the natural decline in PCN populations in the absence of a host, as well as the use of trap crops, biofumigation techniques, or the early destruction of susceptible potato crops before the PCN life cycle has completed. This latter technique, however, has a hugely detrimental impact on crop yield. Cultural control methods need to be very carefully monitored and as they are rarely 100% effective and can be costly to implement. Good farm hygiene, including cleaning of equipment and machinery, will help minimize spread between fields, while regular testing for the presence of PCN helps in monitoring for the pest, but for seed crop production it is essential to demonstrate that the land is PCN\u2010free. The most cost\u2010efficient and effective strategy is the use of natural host resistance (see below), which, in combination with other techniques such as chemical and cultural methods, is especially recommended as an integrated pest management system. However, effective deployment of resistance requires accurate species, and ideally pathotype, designation. Although the molecular factors that determine the virulence of PCN are not yet known, a high\u2010throughput tool for identification and genotyping of G.\u00a0pallida populations has been developed based on MiSeq sequencing of pooled mitochondrial cytB sequences (Eves\u2010van den Akker, Lilley, Reid, et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015).

Following embryogenesis, the first moult occurs within the egg, giving rise to the second stage infective juvenile (J2), which then hatches from the eggshell. Hatching depends on many environmental factors, such as soil temperature and moisture, but most significantly it depends on chemical cues within host root exudates. Responding specifically to host exudates allows this host\u2010specific pathogen to coordinate its life cycle with the presence of a host. The detailed chemical composition of host root exudates is complex and remains to be properly characterized. The mixture of chemicals includes a range of secondary metabolites whose structure is often difficult to determine. PCN responds to numerous compounds present in root exudates (e.g., Byrne et\u00a0al.,\u00a01998) as opposed to a single chemical component to induce hatch. To date, three key hatching stimulants have been identified from potato root exudates, solanoeclepin A (Tanino et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011), \u03b1\u2010chaconine, and \u03b1\u2010solanine (Devine et\u00a0al.,\u00a01996), while the steroidal alkaloids (aglycones) solanidine and solasodine, which are found in potato root exudates, will also stimulate hatch but to a lesser effect (Ochola et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14224, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Once hatched, infective J2 need to quickly locate host roots in order to feed before their reserves are depleted. They are guided to host roots by following chemical cues (Devine & Jones,\u00a02003). After invading the root via intracellular penetration, the nematode migrates through host cells to the pericycle, where it identifies a cell suitable for transformation into a feeding site (the initial syncytial cell), usually in the inner cortex (Sobczak & Golinowski,\u00a02011). The syncytium is formed by cell wall dissolution and fusion of protoplasts (Jones & Northcote,\u00a01972). The J2 feeds on the syncytium contents using a feeding tube that is produced during each feeding cycle. It has been suggested that this acts as a filter to prevent destruction of the feeding site, which the nematode must keep alive for the duration of the life cycle (Eves\u2010van den Akker, Lilley, Jones, et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015).

Juveniles that successfully initiate a productive feeding site that abuts the vascular tissues of the plant tend to develop into females while those whose nutrient intake is restricted are more likely to develop into males. These nematodes may have induced feeding sites in suboptimal parts of the root or that fail to connect with the vascular tissues (Sobczak et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997). Under high population densities, competition for nutrients can result in 10 times more males than females (Trudgill,\u00a01967). Some natural resistance genes against PCN, including resistance derived from Solanum sparsipilum (Caromel et al., 2005), operate in this way, restricting development of the syncytium and thus resulting in a sex ratio skewed heavily towards males. Both males and females enter adulthood after the fourth moult. At this stage, the female has swollen so that her body ruptures the cortex of the root. Males exit the root and are attracted to the adult female due to pheromones that she releases (Green,\u00a01980; Green & Plumb,\u00a01970). As the swollen gravid female begins to senesce, her internal organs begin to deteriorate and the cuticle tans, hardens, and forms a toughened cyst wall. The cysts remain in the soil where J2 develop inside the eggs awaiting the next suitable host to stimulate hatch.

Effectors of PPN, including PCN, are mostly expressed in either the subventral or dorsal pharyngeal gland cells (Jones et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). This restricted expression profile allows candidate effector sequences to be verified using in situ hybridization, which examines the spatial expression patterns of the candidate genes in the nematode. Initially, candidate effectors were identified on the basis of the presence of a signal peptide, the absence of a transmembrane helix, and significant up\u2010regulation in one or more parasitic stages of the nematode (Thorpe et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014). Subsequently, an approach was developed for effector identification based on the presence of a promoter region previously identified as being associated with effectors known to be expressed in the dorsal gland cell of PCN (Eves\u2010van den Akker & Birch,\u00a02016; Eves\u2010van den Akker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). For this approach, the regions upstream of a collection of genes that had previously been experimentally verified as being expressed in the dorsal gland cell were examined using motif analysis software to identify motifs enriched in these genomic regions. One motif, the DOG box, was preferentially enriched in these regions as compared to a selection of known noneffectors and effectors expressed in the subventral gland cells. A statistical analysis of the entire gene set of G.\u00a0rostochiensis showed that increased iterations of the promoter were associated with an increased probability of the motif being upstream of a predicted secreted protein. Functional validation of this promoter as a predictor for effectors was provided by the identification of new effectors based on the presence of the promoter (Eves\u2010van den Akker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016).

The subventral gland cells show signs of being most active at the preparasitic J2 stage and are also active in adult males, while the dorsal gland cell grows throughout the life cycle. In keeping with this, analysis of the expression profiles of all predicted effectors of G.\u00a0pallida showed that most of these sequences were expressed either at the J2 (=\u00a0early parasitic; subventral gland cells) or parasitic (=\u00a0later parasitic; dorsal gland cell) stages of PCN (Thorpe et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014). Similarly, effectors used in the early stages of the life cycle, such as the cell wall\u2010degrading enzymes, which are used during invasion and migration are expressed primarily on the subventral gland cells (e.g., Smant et al., 1998). By contrast, effectors expressed in the dorsal gland cells have roles in the later stages of the interaction with the host plant, including suppression of host defences and induction of the feeding site (e.g., Lee et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011; Postma et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25961, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of the surprising findings emerging from the analysis of effectors in PCN is the presence of a high number of highly expanded effector gene families, most notably the glutathione synthetases and SPRY (SP1a and Ryanodine Receptor) domain proteins. SPRY domain proteins are ancient in evolutionary terms and are present in animals, plants, and fungi. The SPRY domain itself was originally identified in the spore lysis SP1a protein from the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (slime mould) and in mammalian Ca2+\u2010release channel Ryanodine receptors (Ponting et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997). The SPRY domain is thought to be important in protein\u2013protein interactions and no enzymatic activity has been identified that is associated with this domain (Perfetto et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013). Most nematode species analysed to date have a relatively small number of SPRY domain proteins that do not have a signal peptide and are therefore predicted to be intracellular proteins. However, PCN possess greatly expanded SPRY domain protein families, including a subset (approximately 10%) that have a signal peptide for secretion and that are expressed in the dorsal gland cells (Cotton et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014; Mei et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015). Those SPRY domain proteins with a signal peptide (SPRYSECs) are expressed solely at the early stages of parasitism, while those without signal peptides either are not expressed or are expressed across the life cycle (Mei et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015). Several studies have shown that at least some of the SPRYSEC proteins suppress effector\u2010triggered immunity (ETI) induced by the activation of resistance proteins (Ali, Magne, Chen, Obradovic et al., 2015; Mei et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015; Postma et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012). More recently it has been shown that one SPRYSEC targets the plant ubiquitination machinery to modulate stress responses (Diaz\u2010Granados et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020). Although a role for SPRYSECs in suppressing host defence responses has been established, there are many questions remaining about this gene family. Why is this gene family so hugely expanded in cyst nematodes? What are the roles (if any) of the nonsecreted SPRY domain proteins, or do these sequences represent an \u201ceffector graveyard\u201d of sequences that may be disadvantageous to the nematode? One SPRYSEC (RBP\u20101) is recognized by a PCN resistance gene (Gpa2) (Sacco et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009), indicating that these proteins play a role at the interface between plant and pathogen, and are therefore under strong selection pressure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28422, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SPRYSEC effectors most probably evolved from a housekeeping protein present more widely in nematodes, as is also the case for the glutathione synthetase (GS) effectors.

The morphological changes that underlie syncytium development in susceptible plants have been described in some detail (Sobczak & Golinowski, 2011). Following root invasion, J2 of PCN migrate intracellularly and destructively until they reach the inner cortex layer. At the inner cortex the behaviour of the nematode changes markedly; rather than using the stylet to destroy cell walls, the nematode uses this structure to probe individual cells, seeking a cell that does not respond adversely (either by collapsing or depositing callose). Cell wall openings in this initial syncytial cell are formed, initially by widening of pre\u2010existing plasmodesmata, followed by controlled breakdown of the plant cell wall in these regions. Numerous ultrastructural changes associated with the transformation of this cell into a much more metabolically active structure are then observed: the cytoplasm proliferates, the central vacuole breaks down, and the nucleus becomes enlarged. These changes are also observed in the cells surrounding the initial syncytial cell. Eventually the protoplasts of the initial syncytial cell and its neighbours fuse at the cell wall openings, a process repeated with further layers of cells until several hundred cells are incorporated into the syncytium. Changes in the expression of cell cycle genes occur in the syncytium, including DNA replication through endoreduplication. The process of syncytium induction is critical to the nematode; each nematode can only create one syncytium, which it is then dependent upon for all its nutrient requirements for development to the adult stage. The syncytium must therefore be maintained and kept alive for 4\u20136\u00a0weeks, a period of biotrophy that is almost unparalleled in plant\u2013pathogen interactions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32102, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although we still do not have a detailed understanding of the molecular processes underlying syncytium induction by nematodes, significant progress has been made on two main fronts: the role for nematode CLE peptides and the importance of disruption of auxin transport. Cyst nematodes use CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION\u2010related (CLE) peptide mimics to modulate host developmental programmes for feeding cell formation. Genes encoding CLE\u2010like peptides have been found in a wide range of cyst nematode species, including PCN (Lu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009), which are adapted to the specific host (Pokhare et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020). Cyst nematode CLEs have a signal peptide for secretion from the dorsal gland cell, but also include a variable domain that includes a translocation signal that allows them to be localized to the plant endoplasmic reticulum for posttranslational modification and secretion from the plant cell into the apoplast (Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010, 2021). One of the G.\u00a0rostochiensis CLE peptides binds with high affinity to the CLV2 receptor, which is itself up\u2010regulated at the nematode feeding site (Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015). CLE peptide receptors are receptor kinases that control a wide range of key plant developmental processes, including stem cell specification, organogenesis, and vascular differentiation (Guo et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011). Manipulation of these endogenous pathways through CLE effectors may therefore play a key role in syncytium development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33562, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Auxins are essential plant hormones that determine many plant developmental processes. It has been clear for many years that auxin signalling plays a critical role in the development of cyst nematode syncytia. Auxin\u2010insensitive mutants display inhibition or disruption of PCN syncytium development and disturbing polar auxin transport gives rise to abnormally large syncytia (Goverse et al., 2000). This study also showed that an auxin\u2010responsive promoter is specifically activated in developing syncytia. The mechanisms by which these changes in local auxin concentrations are achieved in syncytia have been analysed in some detail, in the context of the interactions between H.\u00a0schachtii and Arabidopsis, and these studies indicate that auxin transport proteins play a critical role (Grunewald et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). Expression of pin1 and pin7 was shown to be down\u2010regulated in developing syncytia and development of nematodes on pin1 mutant plants was severely impaired. By contrast, PIN3 accumulates in the syncytium but, remarkably, becomes relocalized within the syncytium, from a basal to a lateral site in the cell wall. These data indicate that auxin concentrations accumulate in the developing syncytium due to down\u2010regulation of pin1, preventing transport of auxin out of this structure. Subsequently, the relocalization of PIN3 allows auxin to be transferred to lateral cells surrounding the initial syncytial cell, permitting the radial expansion of this structure. Although it remains unclear as to how these changes in auxin transporters are achieved by cyst nematodes, one cyst nematode effector (19C07) has been identified that interacts with, and modulates, the activity of the LAX3 auxin influx transporter (Lee et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011). LAX3 is usually expressed in cells surrounding lateral root primordia and allows influx of auxin, which subsequently activates the expression of cell wall\u2010modifying enzymes required for lateral root emergence. It is known that development of the syncytium requires controlled activation of the plant's own cell wall\u2010degrading enzymes to allow fusion of protoplasts of neighbouring cells (Goellner et al., 2001). LAX3 is expressed in developing syncytia, as well as in cells that are to be incorporated into syncytia, while the interaction between LAX3 and 19C07 takes place at the plasma membrane (Lee et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011). Although lax3 mutants are not significantly different to wild\u2010type plants in terms of susceptibility to nematode infection, aux1/lax3 double mutants and aux1/lax1/lax2/lax3 quadruple mutants show reduced infection levels, indicating the importance of the auxin influx process to syncytium development. In addition, overexpression of 19C07 speeds up lateral root emergence, indicating a probable stimulation of LAX3 by the effector. Although the function of the 19C07 has only been studied in detail in the Arabidopsis\u2013H.\u00a0schachtii pathosystem, similar sequences are present in PCN (Thorpe et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36548, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "RESISTANCE AGAINST PCN", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36571, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The use of natural host resistance has so far provided the most effective tool for management of PCN, particularly G.\u00a0rostochiensis. The restricted genetic heterogeneity of the G.\u00a0rostochiensis present in Europe means that durable resistance has been provided against this species in Europe with cultivars containing the H1 gene. The G.\u00a0pallida present in Europe is more genetically diverse and thus identification of a single major resistance (R) gene for control of this species has been more challenging (Caromel et al., 2005; van der Voort et al., 1997; van der Vossen et\u00a0al.,\u00a02000). Progress has been made with processing cultivars such as Innovator, which contains the Gpa5 gene from Solanum vernei. However, Innovator is intolerant and thus does not perform well where higher population densities of PCN are present and breakdown of this resistance has already been observed (Mwangi et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019). Much effort is being given to address the lack of G.\u00a0pallida\u2010resistant cultivars with appropriate agronomic characters. It is likely that these will require more considered management to preserve their durability. Resistance sources from S.\u00a0vernei (Gpa5) and S.\u00a0tuberosum subsp. andigena (H3) are widely used in commercial breeding programmes for G.\u00a0pallida. The S.\u00a0vernei Gpa5 source is controlled by two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that are located on chromosomes V and IX (Bryan et\u00a0al.,\u00a02002), while the H3 source is controlled by QTLs on chromosomes IV and XI (Bryan et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004).

One PCN avirulence (Avr) gene, AvrGpa2, has been identified to date (Sacco et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). AvrGpa2 is a SPRYSEC effector protein (RBP1) and recognition/loss of recognition is determined by a single amino acid polymorphism. Further analysis of sequence variation within RBP1 shows that this site is under strong selection pressure and is the only variable site that determines pathogen recognition (Carpentier et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012). Further analysis of PCN using a variety of approaches has been undertaken to identify the genetic differences underlying recognition by the host, or that underpin the ability to infect particular host species. For example, several attempts have been made to identify transcriptomic differences in PCN that are associated with differences in host range. Comparisons of genes expressed in PCN with two closely related species that have a different host range, G.\u00a0tabacum and G.\u00a0mexicana, showed a strong enrichment for effector\u2010encoding genes amongst the differentially expressed sequences (Sabeh et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019). Genomic approaches have also identified differences in effector sequences as potentially being critical in underpinning differences in virulence, in this case defined as the ability to reproduce on plants carrying a particular resistance source. Several studies of genomic differences between lines of G.\u00a0pallida selected for virulence against the H3 resistance source from S.\u00a0tuberosum subsp. andigena or the S.\u00a0vernei Gpa5 source showed that sequences encoding potential effectors, particularly SPRYSEC effectors, were among the most likely to show polymorphisms (Eoch\u2010Bosy et al., 2017; Varypatakis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020).

Understanding the detailed mechanisms behind host resistance to PCN, and whether the same types of novel resistance that do not involve NB\u2010LRR\u2010like proteins as described for resistance against soybean cyst nematodes, is also of critical importance towards deploying resistance in the field.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48138, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supporting information", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48161, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48189, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analysed in this study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48291, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "REFERENCES", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48302, "infons": {"elocation-id": "e0115042", "pub-id_doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0115042", "pub-id_pmid": "25606855", "section_type": "REF", "source": "PLoS One", "type": "ref", "volume": "10", "year": "2015"}, "text": "Analysis of putative apoplastic effectors from the nematode, Globodera rostochiensis, and identification of an expansin\u2010like protein that can induce and suppress host defenses", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48480, "infons": {"fpage": "623", "pub-id_doi": "10.3389/fpls.2015.00623", "pub-id_pmid": "26322064", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Frontiers in Plant Science", "type": "ref", "volume": "6", "year": "2015"}, "text": "Analysis of Globodera rostochiensis effectors reveals conserved functions of SPRYSEC proteins in suppressing and eliciting plant immune responses", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48626, "infons": {"fpage": "E7375", "lpage": "E7382", "pub-id_doi": "10.1073/pnas.1610150113", "pub-id_pmid": "27821740", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "type": "ref", "volume": "113", "year": "2016"}, "text": "Disease resistance by impairment of \u03b1\u2010SNAP", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48673, "infons": {"fpage": "477", "lpage": "508", "pub-id_doi": "10.1007/s12571-012-0220-1", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Food Security", "type": "ref", "volume": "4", "year": "2012"}, "text": "Crops that feed the world.
