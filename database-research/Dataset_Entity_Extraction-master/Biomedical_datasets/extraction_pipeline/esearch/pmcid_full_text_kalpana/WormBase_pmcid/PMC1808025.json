We found that for splice site detection in C. elegans, position-specific scoring matrices are not sufficient. If we allow long substrings to contribute, we can significantly improve the recognition performance. To illustrate this, we measured the area under the precision recall curve (auPRC, cf.) for the SVM splice site classifiers while restricting the maximal length d of considered substrings. We found that the auPRC for classifying acceptor (donor) site with d = 1 is only 79.9% (62.2%). The performance increases when increasing d\u2014for instance for d = 2 to 93.0% (89.7%)\u2014and reaches a plateau for d = 8 at 95.9% (93.9%). To gain insights into what the SVM uses for discrimination, we study so-called positional oligomer importance matrices (POIMs) that illustrate which length of substrings is important at which position (cf. Materials and Methods for details). Figure 6 shows the POIMs for donor (left) and acceptor (right) splice sites. We can observe that there are two regions per site that are of importance: near the splice site and around 50 nucleotides (nt) downstream or upstream. It turns out that introns are often rather short (only 50nt) and the weaker site relates to sequence signals of the other splice site. We find that the intronic regions near the splice sites are of particular importance, which is in line with the current understanding of how splicing works. Finally, we find that near the end (10\u201320 nt upstream of donor site) and at the start (2\u20136 nt downstream of acceptor site) of the exon very long substrings are important for discrimination, which are likely to correspond to exonic splicing enhancer or inhibitor binding sites (see and references therein).

This is all the more remarkable since we only use information which in principle is also available to the cellular splicing machinery, such as sequence-based splice site identification (e.g., available via the splicing factors U1\u2013U6), lengths of exons and introns (via physical properties of mRNA), and intron as well as exon content (for instance, via splice enhancers). We do not use exon counts, repeat masking, similarity to known genes and proteins, or any other evolutionary information. This distinguishes our method from alignment-based systems which do not put an emphasis on statistical structure and learning, but typically rely entirely on homology and evolutionary information. The fact that mSplicer mainly relies on very accurate splice site predictions explains why mSplicer's prediction accuracy is very high and also why it does not decay drastically in UTRs (unpublished data). It is to be noted that additional information, however, could complement our predictions. Closer in spirit to our machine learning approach are systems such as Genscan, SNAP, or ExonHunter that are used in many genome annotations. However, these systems are typically based on generative models, trying to estimate probability densities. It has been argued that approaches of this type are not necessarily tuned to produce the best discrimination, as high-dimensional density estimation is known to be a task harder than discrimination, thus density estimation can be seen as a detour forcing generative approaches to solve a problem harder than necessary.

In addition, our approach can be applied to genomes where only a small fraction of sequenced mRNA is available. For instance, for P. pacificus there are only relatively few EST sequences available. Statistical properties of the P. pacificus genome deviated considerably from those of C. elegans genome (e.g., exons and introns are on average only half as long). Hence, it is not surprising that the error rates of mSplicer are considerably higher than for C. elegans. However, after partly retraining our C. elegans system, mSplicer (SM) achieved an error rate of only 22%.
