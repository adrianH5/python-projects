A standard GO annotation is made by associating a gene product to a GO term supported by an evidence code from the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) and the data source for that specific assertion. For example, Caenorhabditis elegans air-2 is annotated to `protein serine/threonine kinase activity\u2019 (GO:0004674), with the evidence code `direct assay evidence used in manual assertion\u2019 (ECO:0000314) linked to the source PMID:15916946. This annotation was based on an in vitro kinase assay presented in Han et al., demonstrating that AIR-2 can phosphorylate serine 634 in TLK-1. The central role of a GO curator is to interpret the functional data and select terms to best represent a gene's role. Curation using the GO relies on careful and accurate curation to a set of guidelines developed by Consortium participants. Within the GO Consortium (GOC), curators and ontologists meet frequently to ensure that practices are reviewed and kept current. GO annotation standards, however, are based on low-throughput experimental set-ups, where the results of experiments can be interpreted in context, accounting for background knowledge about the gene, experimental hypothesis, physiological relevance of the assay and other criteria.

In general, low-throughput studies aim to elucidate the role of a targeted selection of gene products. These studies are usually hypothesis driven, with the experimental design founded on previous knowledge. The workflow tends to be a series of small-scale experiments that either approach the same biological question in multiple ways and/or incrementally extend the characterization to build a more complete biological model. It should first be noted that high-throughput studies encompass a wide variety of experimental methodologies, and those amenable to functional annotation using the GO represent a small subset of such studies. Most high-throughput studies, for example genome-wide association studies and drug screens, fall outside of the remit of the GO curator. Typically, high-throughput experiments apply the same workflow to a large number of genes/gene products often using an automatic or semi-automatic methodology and may provide little or no secondary validation of the results for individual gene products.

For many high-throughput data types, numerous consortia and groups, such as the ProteomeXchange consortium, have defined data exchange formats and established standards to describe data. However, for many other high-throughput experiments, data standards do not exist, or, if they do exist, the standards reported often do not include any confidence thresholds, particularly for purely qualitative data sets.

First, all high-throughput data sets contain false positives to a degree, which is usually difficult to establish, and, thus curating this data will generate some incorrect annotations. Some high-throughput studies incorporate multiple experimental steps or computational analyses to reduce the level of false positives, but many other studies are not sufficiently rigorous in the identification of false positives to provide the level of certainty required for inclusion in the GO database (see Case study 1).

Indeed, many annotation groups indicated strongly that they wanted to retain GO annotation of existing high-value data sets, and groups continue to make annotations from new high-throughput papers when they fill a particular knowledge gap. For example, the global analysis of protein localization using green fluorescent protein tagging in fission yeast provides extensive coverage, 4431 proteins, corresponding to ~90% of the proteome. This data set was annotated using terms from the GO cellular component aspect by PomBase in 2009 and still includes many proteins that are as yet uncharacterized by low-throughput techniques.
