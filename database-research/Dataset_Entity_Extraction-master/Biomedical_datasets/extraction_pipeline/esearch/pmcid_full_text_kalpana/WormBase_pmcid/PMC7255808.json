Among these, 1500 protein-protein interactions have been curated by BioGRID as a collaboration with WormBase. Within the data set, 17,990 protein-protein interactions are unique, and 6,079 unique genes are involved in these interactions. In order to visualize the overall interaction map, a network diagram for all the unique interactions was generated by using the \u2018Cytoscape\u2019 program, version 3.6.1 (Shannon et al. 2003) (Figure 1A). These numbers represent a 108% increase in the number of interaction annotations since last year, 2017. These interaction data were curated from 1,251 peer-reviewed papers, which were selected from the literature by \u2018Textpresso Central\u2019 using automatic SVM (Support Vector Machine)-based text mining approaches (Fang et al. 2012; M\u00fcller et al. 2018) and manual verification. Compared to other databases providing C. elegans protein-protein interaction, WormBase now presents the largest data set, which has 1.72-fold more interaction annotations than IMEx (Orchard et al. 2012) and 4.51-fold more than BioGRID (Chatr-Aryamontri et al. 2017) (Figure 1B). Most significantly, WormBase now houses the complete protein interaction data from almost all of the C. elegans literature published from 1993 to 2018. The data sets presented at IMEx and BioGRID are annotated from 253 and 174 papers, respectively. All the physical interaction data in WormBase are supported by experimental evidence from original research papers. The statistics of the detection methods used as experimental evidence are shown in Figure 1C. The majority of the interaction data came from high throughput analysis such as large-scale yeast two-hybrid assays or mass-spectrometry, however, a significant portion of the data (13.1%) are supported by more direct detection methods using small-scale, low throughput methods such as co-immunoprecipitation or co-crystallography (Figure 1C).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4442, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In WormBase, protein-protein interaction data can be found as a subclass of physical interaction data in the \u2018Interactions widget\u2019 on the gene report page.

All the interaction data are represented together in a graph created with \u2018Cytoscape.js\u2019 and a table. In the table, the gene names of interaction partners (bait-target) in the interaction are displayed along with the publication.

Integrated views of interaction data from diverse model organisms will be extremely helpful to build interaction databases for species-to-species comparison, and to establish a disease model quickly based on the database.
