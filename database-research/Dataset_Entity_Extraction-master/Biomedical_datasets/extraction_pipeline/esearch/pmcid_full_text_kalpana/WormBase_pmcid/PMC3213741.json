By using a manual QC step we can selectively unlink ambiguous terms, ensuring that the reader is taken to the correct webpage. One suggested solution to resolve these ambiguities is to rely on user feedback and employ the reader to correct links, which is in use by Utopia Documents and Reflect  (relayed to us by one of anonymous reviewers). While this may prove an optimal solution for these fully automated tools, as we are starting from the point of the actual database that is being linked to, we might not benefit as much as these other projects. However, we are open to modifications of our pipeline that would increase our efficiency.

However, our problem differs from others in that we have an advantage of knowing the different species discussed in an article a priori from the journal publisher and the authors. Hence the problem of species identification itself is not a major challenge we face. In addition, as noted, authors usually specify the species name near the entity should there be any ambiguity. For example, authors may use abbreviations (Sc for S. cerevisiae, Sp for Schizosaccharomyces pombe) before the entity name for disambiguation, which could be identified before linking is started. Finally, since we expand our pipeline one MOD at a time and work closely with MOD curators, identifying unique styles and conventions of writing scientific articles for each species could be captured and used for automatic disambiguation.
