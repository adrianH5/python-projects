The multidisciplinary consortium of BAMOS, formed by international leading research centres, collaborates through research and innovation staff exchanges. The project covers all the stages of the development before the clinical trials: design of scaffolds, biomaterials development, processability under additive manufacturing, in vitro test, and in vivo test.

In order to repair defects located in a joint and restore its function, one possible approach is the use of tissue-engineered OC scaffolds, which are intended to delay or eliminate the need for joint replacement. Although they have been established for the repair of small OC defects, no products to date have demonstrated the appropriate biomechanical properties required to promote successful long-lasting regeneration of large OC defects. Biomaterials and Additive Manufacturing: Osteochondral Scaffold (BAMOS) project addresses this challenge in osteoarthritis treatment by bringing together five internationally leading research organisations (Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain; University of Minho, Portugal; University College London, UK; Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University and Zhejiang University, China) and two healthcare providers (Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, UK; and Sa\u00fade Atl\u00e2ntica-Gest\u00e3o Hospitalar, S.A., Portugal) to work on the development, manufacturing and marketing of OC scaffolds for the repair of large cartilage damages in osteoarthritis patients. The following specific objectives of BAMOS derive from this main objective: a) Define clinical specifications for OC scaffolds, b) develop new OC scaffolds biomaterials, c) develop innovative additive manufacturing techniques to produce patient-specific OC scaffolds, d) assess the OC scaffold in both in vitro and in vivo, and e) equip early-stage researchers with the advanced knowledge and experience to address society\u2019s grand healthcare challenges.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3015, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "After a complete physicochemical and in vitro characterization, the efficacy of different OC scaffolds developed in the context of BAMOS project was evaluated using clinical animal models.

After 8 weeks of implantation, the hierarchical scaffolds showed good integration (with no signs of inflammatory reactions), cartilage tissue regeneration and calcified tissue formation. Histological analyses confirmed the formation of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycans in the HRP-SF layer, while bone ingrowth and blood vessel infiltration were observed in the bone-like layer.
