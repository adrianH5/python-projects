Bipolar disorder impacts approximately 1\u20135% of the population and is associated with increased premature mortality, in which life expectancy is reduced by 9\u201317 years due to comorbid medical illnesses and suicide (Dome et al.). Bipolar disorder is linked to substantial functional impairment across diverse domains, including responsibilities in work or school, household duties and maintenance of relationships (Sanchez-Moreno et al.). Depressive episodes often have a greater impact on functional impairment than hypo(manic) symptoms in bipolar disorder (Rosa et al.), and the severity of depressive symptoms demonstrates a robust association with the level of functional impairment (Simon et al.). The economic costs are estimated to be more than \u00a36.43\u00a0billion in the UK due to direct health care costs and indirect costs (Simon et al.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3530, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The most common treatments are a combination of medications, including mood stabilisers and antipsychotic medication, and talking therapy (Grande et al.).

The current can shift membrane potentials which increasing the likelihood towards depolarization at the anode and hyperpolarization at the cathode (Nitsche and Paulus). tDCS primes neuronal clusters but does not cause the direct firing of neurons in contrast to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (Mutz et al.) which triggers an action potential and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) which causes a generalised seizure (Woodham et al.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 4815, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Meta-analyses demonstrate that a course of tDCS for the treatment of a major depressive episode is associated with significant improvement in depressive symptoms and clinical response in both unipolar and bipolar depression (Hsu et al.; Mutz et al.). In an individual patient level analysis, there is evidence that longer courses of treatment showed stronger effects (Nikolin et al.). As tDCS requires daily sessions over several weeks, this is time intensive and potentially costly in terms of travel. Providing the treatment at home could improve engagement, compliance and clinical efficacy. However, only a single trial has investigated home-based tDCS in bipolar depression (Lee et al.). This recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) of home-based tDCS in bipolar depression did not observe a significant effect in efficacy for active tDCS relative to sham tDCS (Lee et al.). The RCT though was likely underpowered due to the small sample size (n\u2009=\u200964) and participants had several sessions in clinic with research team members (Lee et al.). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis of RCTs in bipolar depression, which had included this RCT (Lee et al.), reported significant improvement in depressive symptoms following active relative to sham tDCS (standardised effect size \u2212\u20091.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.65 to -0.69) (Hsu et al.). Furthermore, the meta-analysis observed larger effect sizes when the length of treatment was increased from 6 to 10 weeks (Hsu et al.).

Remote real-time supervision during stimulation allowed for close monitoring of adverse events and ensuring that the device was used correctly. However, this is resource intensive and reduces flexibility for patients. Monitoring of side effects with an online daily report has also been effective in a home-based trial (Alonzo et al.) as well as periodic monitoring visits in two large home-based trials (Borrione et al.; Woodham et al.). Safety reporting for home-based tDCS treatments is an important consideration as reports of skin burns at the electrode site have been reported (Kumpf et al.; Woodham et al.), which can occur with insufficient moistening with conductive saline solution (Kortteenniemi et al.) or application of tap water to moisten sponges (Frank et al.; Palm et al.).

As far as we are aware, the present study is the first to employ remote supervision for home-based tDCS for bipolar depression. A significant advantage of employing a home-based tDCS protocols is that participants had the autonomy to schedule their sessions according to their preferences, thereby enabling them to maintain a consistent regimen at a convenient time. This may have contributed to the low attrition rate which was notably lower than clinic-based tDCS protocols, in which the attrition rate might reach 10.1% (Brunoni et al.; Mutz et al.).

The large observed effects could be in part due to a placebo effect, and the provision of real-time supervision for each session likely played a role in the improvement of depressive symptoms (Papoutsi and Fu). Thematic analysis of feedback from our unipolar depression tDCS pilot trial indicated that the presence of the same researcher at each visit was rapport building and helped participants feel connected and safe (Rimmer et al.), which likely contributed to the high response and remission rates. Furthermore, the study did not control for the types of medication. Participants were required to maintain a stable dosage of mood stabilizing medication for at least two weeks or abstain from medication for the same duration. Mood stabilizers such as lithium and lamotrigine, exert their effects through the modulation of cortical excitability, a mechanism shared with voltage-gated sodium channels (Lee et al.). A reduction in cortical excitability could be associated with a reduction in tDCS efficacy (Romero Lauro et al.). Variations in head sizes, individual anatomical characteristics, and device placement among users may have resulted in different configurations of electrical field density within the brain. Individual differences in tDCS effects may arise partially due to discrepancies in electric fields. The tDCS device used in the current study underwent electric field modelling, which indicates its targeting of areas implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder within the prefrontal cortex. However, differences in the device positioning may have influenced the intensity of the electric field and subsequently impacted treatment outcomes. Most participants were recruited from online advertisements and results may be less generalisable to patients who have not taken an interest in tDCS.
