Over 14 million new cancer cases occur every year, but are projected to reach approximately 22 million by 2030. Among all cancer types, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, and approximately 4.4 million women worldwide live with a diagnosis of breast cancer. Fortunately, the survival rate is very encouraging; the estimated number of deaths from breast cancer is estimated to be less than one-third of new cases. Developments in screening and improved treatments for breast cancer have led to improved survival, and it is beginning to be regarded as a chronic disease.

There is strong evidence about the efficacy and safety of exercise and healthy diet to improve the patients\u2019 quality of life (QoL) and reduce the effects of cancer. Recent research reveals that even when patients know the benefits of interventions aimed at promoting energy balance among cancer survivors (in terms of intake and physical activity), it is unrealistic to expect that most of them, who have a strong sedentary habit, will comply with the current good practice guidelines. In addition, survivors report difficulties in adhering to and maintaining an appropriate lifestyle. Consequently, this energy imbalance increases the risk of cancer recurrence and, along with the functional limitations and emotional/occupational imbalance, reduces the QoL of breast cancer survivors (BCS). New strategies with a comprehensive approach of support must be developed to improve the adherence and motivation of these patients and to reduce the high cost involved in creating individualized exercise programs and diets. Currently, technological support is a promising strategy that could improve issues, such as barriers of distance, time, cost and motivational aspects. Telehealth systems, which are based on computers and mobile applications (m-health), offer a promising approach for both dietary and physical activity assessments and the patients\u2019 motivation can be significantly increased through the immediate feedback provided by these systems.
