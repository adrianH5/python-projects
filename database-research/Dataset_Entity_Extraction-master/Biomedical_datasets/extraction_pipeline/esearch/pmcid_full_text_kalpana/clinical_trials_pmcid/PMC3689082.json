In trials of immunotherapy for seasonal allergies, treatment is initiated weeks or months prior to the onset of pollen season and the associated symptoms, to allow the treatment to modulate the immune system before the season starts. Therefore, subjects are enrolled based on symptoms experienced in previous seasons; however, the severity of symptoms in previous seasons may not be an accurate predictor of upcoming symptoms due to several complicating factors.

In that study, grass AIT initiated an average of 26\u00a0weeks prior to the start of the GPS significantly reduced AR/C symptoms and medication use. The efficacy of grass AIT has been demonstrated in 4 phase 2 and 3 trials conducted in European subjects with AR/C due to grass pollen allergy; 2 large, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in North American subjects assessed symptoms during the 2009 GPS and found that pre- and co-seasonal treatment with grass AIT was well tolerated and significantly reduced AR/C symptoms and combined symptom and medication score. As in other trials of grass AIT, there were no cases of anaphylactic shock in the present study; epinephrine was administered to 3 subjects, all of whom experienced symptoms within 10\u00a0minutes after the first dose of grass AIT and none of whom showed signs of hypotension.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20297, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Post hoc analyses of the present trial were attempted, to clarify what characteristics of its population or design might have contributed to its failure to achieve the results seen in successful trials of grass AIT. As in \u201creal-world\u201d conditions, many subjects in the study were sensitized to multiple allergens; approximately 50% of subjects were sensitized to tree pollen, cat hair, and HDM. However, subgroup analysis of subjects without these additional sensitizations also failed to show significant differences between grass AIT and placebo. Further, the proportion of subjects also sensitized to other common allergens in the present trial was similar to those seen in other trials of grass AIT, in which significant treatment effects were seen. A recent pooled analysis of data from 6 such placebo-controlled randomized trials that found that response to grass AIT treatment was similar between subjects sensitized only to grass and subjects sensitized to other common allergens. Given these pieces of evidence, it is considered unlikely that the efficacy of grass AIT was masked by the allergic responses to other common seasonal and perennial allergens.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21465, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "However, several lines of evidence give support to the idea that the symptoms reported by subjects in this trial may not have been reflective of the influence of grass pollen exposure. First, the pattern of symptoms during the GPS was unexpected. In the current study, symptom severity and medication use did not show any clear relationship to seasonal pollen exposure. By comparison, symptoms generally mirrored pollen levels in other grass AIT studies, ie, peak symptoms coincided with peak pollen levels. Additionally, subjects in the current trial showed high pre-seasonal symptoms, whereas in other grass AIT trials symptoms were relatively minimal in the pre-seasonal period. A post hoc analysis divided subjects into those with low pre-seasonal symptoms (DSS \u22643; 33% of all subjects) and those with high pre-seasonal symptoms (DSS >3; 67% of all subjects). In those with pre-seasonal DSS \u22643, mean DSS and mean DMS were both significantly lower over the GPS in the grass AIT group compared with the placebo group (27%; p\u2009=\u20090.0327 and 68%; p\u2009=\u20090.0060, respectively). The 27% reduction in symptom scores was similar to the magnitude of the treatment effect seen in other grass AIT trials (18% to 30% reduction in mean DSS relative to placebo), and as in these trials the symptom scores closely corresponded to pollen exposure. In subjects with pre-season DSS >3, no significant differences between grass AIT and placebo were seen for mean DSS or DMS (p >0.05). Along with the fact that no relationship of symptoms to pollen count was observed in the overall population, this suggests that the symptoms reported in this trial were not primarily reflective of the effects of grass pollen exposure. It is conceivable that subjects were suffering symptoms due to some other unidentified cause, or that some subjects understood poorly the standards by which they were to score their symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23369, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23381, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter North American trial, grass AIT at a dose of 2800 BAU was not associated with significant improvements in AR/C symptom or medication scores versus placebo over the GPS. These results contrast with the efficacy repeatedly demonstrated in European and 2 other North American trials of grass AIT for the treatment of AR/C. Multiple possibilities have been explored as plausible explanations for the trial failure. Though no firm conclusions can be made, the high pre-seasonal symptoms, lack of a relationship between pollen count and symptom score in the presence of significant immunological response, and the significant results of post hoc analysis excluding subjects with high pre-seasonal scores suggest that the symptoms reported were not primarily reflective of the effects of grass pollen exposure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24251, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24259, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Study design", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24272, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This was a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter trial conducted at 28 sites in the United States (GT-14; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00421655).
