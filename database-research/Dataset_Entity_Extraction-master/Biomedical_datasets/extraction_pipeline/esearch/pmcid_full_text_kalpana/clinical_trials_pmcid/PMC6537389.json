The proportions of patients in this analysis who had radiographic signs were lower than those previously reported, particularly for halo signs. In this study, 16.7% of patients presented with halo signs, compared with between 60.9 and ~\u2009100.0% of patients in previous studies. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the method of radiographic interpretation. In order to make the findings of this post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial generalizable to real-world clinical scenarios, and considering that treatment decisions for immunocompromised patients with suspected IA do not necessarily await radiologist interpretation, we classified radiographic findings according to documentation in clinical charts, which were not necessarily the observations of radiologists. In contrast, other studies reporting higher rates of radiographic lesions have relied on the interpretation of radiologists. Moreover, although the risk of misclassification of radiographic signs may not have been systematically different between patients classified as cIA and nIA, nor between treatment arms, if non-radiologists are less (or more) likely to document the presence of certain signs, the power of this study to observe differences between patients who were later classified as cIA or nIA may have been affected. It is also worth noting that patients with possible IA and radiographic abnormalities may have had IA infection, even if further investigation failed to upgrade the diagnosis to proven/probable IA; this may have resulted in an underestimation of the discriminative value of chest CT scans. Overall, the results should be interpreted with caution as this is a post-hoc analysis and further confirmative studies are warranted.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22485, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22497, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, it appears that once a patient meets minimal EORTC/MSG criteria for possible IA, differentiating between those with or without confirmed IA based on baseline CT scan can be difficult. It was interesting to observe that radiographic abnormalities from chest CT scans, such as halo and air-crescent signs traditionally associated with IA, were generally not associated with subsequent confirmation of IA. However, this could be due to the low proportion of patients presenting with such signs, so caution should be applied when interpreting the diagnostic utility of these abnormalities in the context of this study. Abnormalities observed in this analysis associated with cIA include ground-glass attenuation and nodules as well as, to a lesser degree, bilateral lesions. Taken together with findings from other groups, this suggests that radiographic abnormalities should be interpreted in conjunction with other available clinical data to guide management decisions on individual patients, including whether treatment is reasonable, pending full evaluation. Considering the high mortality rate associated with IA, patients may need to be managed as having IA until infection has been ruled out.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23708, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Additional file", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23724, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "title"}, "text": "Abbreviations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23738, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "BMI", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23742, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Body mass index", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23758, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "cIA", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23762, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Confirmed invasive aspergillosis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23795, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "CT", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23798, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Computed tomography", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23818, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "CYP", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23822, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cytochrome P450", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23838, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "EORTC", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23844, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23903, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "HSCT", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23908, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23948, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "IA", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23951, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Invasive aspergillosis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23974, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "mITT", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23979, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Modified intent-to-treat", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24004, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "MSG", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24008, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) Mycoses Study Group", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24084, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "nIA", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24088, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Non-confirmed invasive aspergillosis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24125, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SD", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24128, "infons": {"section_type": "ABBR", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Standard deviation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24147, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title"}, "text": "Authors\u2019 contributions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24172, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "JJ and DW created the concept of analysis and contributed vital analytics.
