The relevance of glial reactivity and dysfunction in \u03b1-synucleinopathies is highlighted by numerous experimental evidences. Glial AS inclusion pathology is prominent in oligodendroglia of MSA (glial cytoplasmic inclusions) and is a common finding in astroglial cells of PD and DLB, resulting in specific dysfunctional responses.

Astroglial AS-positive inclusions may also occur in PD. PD pathology has been partly related to point mutations or duplications and triplications of the SNCA gene. Moreover, SNCA variants can increase the risk of developing PD and MSA. AS inclusion formation may be related to posttranslational modifications of AS (nitration, ubiquitination and phosphorylation) which can lead to pathological accumulation of AS and enhance the progression of \u03b1-synucleinopathies. Involvement of impaired AS clearance through autophagy pathways is also suggested to be involved in the generation of AS inclusions in PD and DLB.

Glial dysfunction in \u03b1-synucleinopathies not only comprises the above-mentioned AS-positive inclusion pathology in glia but also an over-activated state of microglial and astroglial cells, termed reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis. On different stimuli, e.g. injury or infection, microglial and astroglial cells get activated. Activation is associated with morphological changes, release of trophic and inflammatory factors and, in regard to microglia, also clearance of dead or damaged cells. These changes can be crucial for neuronal survival. However, regarding chronic disease conditions of the CNS like neurodegenerative diseases, astroglia and microglia can get over activated. Reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis can lead to neurotoxicity and increased tissue damage after the release of (pro-)inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO).

PD and DLB show various degrees of neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and dopaminergic terminals in the striatum, as well as degeneration of extra-nigral structures including noradrenergic system, cholinergic system, serotonergic system, limbic structures and cerebral cortex. The aggregation of AS in neuronal cells is the major pathological hallmark of PD and DLB, including LBs and LNs. PD also features abnormal aggregations of AS in astroglial cells. LB pathology is mostly present at the sites of neuronal loss. However, evidence shows that the occurrence of LBs in the SNpc must not necessarily lead to neuronal death and a high number of neurons undergo apoptosis without the occurrence of AS aggregates. This leads to the assumption that other factors may have a major influence on neuronal degeneration and, therefore, on the progression of these diseases. Hence, the role of microglial and astroglial activation in PD and DLB progression comes into consideration. However, the role of both cell types, microglia and astroglia, is still unclear in PD and DLB because of their controversial beneficial and toxic effects on neurons.

AS overexpression in murine astroglial cells leads to neuroinflammation and microglial activation, and in consequence to oxidative stress, providing a major link of AS astroglial pathology with neuroinflammation/microgliosis and oxidative stress that may also promote neurodegeneration. A possible explanation for the AS-positive inclusions in astroglial cells in PD brains was provided by Lee and colleagues. They show that astroglial cells can endocytose AS released from neurons and form inclusions similar to LBs in a time-dependent manner.

An alternative pathogenic pathway of astroglia-mediated neurotoxicity could be related to morphological and functional alterations in astroglial mitochondria and a disturbed secretion of factors crucial for neuronal differentiation as demonstrated in a genetic mouse model overexpressing mutant AS. In a recent study, cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients was added to an astroglial cell culture, and a decrease in proliferation rate as well as increased contents of AS on day 7 was observed.

Astroglial cells (green) are involved in synaptic transmission support, nutrient support and control of extracellular homeostasis, thereby crucial for neuronal viability. Neurotrophic support is also provided by microglial, astroglial and oligodendroglial (myelinating and non-myelinating) cells. Myelinating oligodendroglia (blue) are essentially involved in maintaining the myelin sheet and trophic support of myelinated neurites. Neuronal \u03b1-synucleinopathies: Early in disease, AS aggregations (yellow) in neurons (grey) and astroglial cells occur, leading to a decreased neuronal viability. Moreover, astroglial cells get activated, resulting in an enhanced release of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory factors. The recruitment of microglial cells starts even before neuronal cell loss occurs, and their arrival at the site of AS accumulation facilitates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as oxidative stress. However, beneficial phagocytic microglial activity may be involved in the early clearance of extracellular AS. Later in disease progression, full-blown neuronal inclusion pathology develops, including the formation of LBs and LNs. The build-up of AS in astroglia leads to dysfunctionality and increased neurotoxic activity. The phagocytic microglia appears inefficient to clear extracellular AS and to stop disease progression. Accumulation of AS may even occur in non-myelinating oligodendroglial cells late in disease. All these dramatic changes in the CNS lead to chronic overactivation of glial cells and an enhanced neuronal cell loss. Oligodendroglial \u03b1-synucleinopathies: At the beginning of MSA, oligodendroglial cells start to accumulate AS in the cytoplasm (origin is still unresolved). Demyelination, oligodendroglial and neuronal degeneration are initiated. Again, activated microglia and astroglia are attracted to the sites of GCI accumulation, and through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, promote the disease.

In a rat PD model with rAAV-based overexpression of AS in the midbrain, the cell number of microglia increased with the level of AS expression. In addition, dopaminergic cell death influenced the AS-induced microglial activation: Occurrence of dopaminergic cell death lead to a delayed and long-lasting microglial activation, whereas the absence of dopaminergic cell death induced an early and transient activation. Furthermore, the activation profile upon AS overexpression was related to four different types of microglial activation associated with different stages of progression of the neurodegenerative process.

However, the broad spectrum of activation profiles of microglial and astroglial cells makes it still difficult to obtain a clear-cut overall picture of all glial features and their mode of action in these diseases. The wide variety of glial functions offers diverse therapeutic targets. Yet, due to the insufficient knowledge on the exact chronology and relevance of the beneficial and detrimental roles of glia in \u03b1-synucleinopathies, researchers are currently confronted with discrepancies between findings on neuroprotection in experimental setups and clinical settings.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30511, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Neuroinflammatory responses and oxidative stress mediated by microglial or astroglial cells are prior targets in therapeutic approaches regarding neuroprotection in \u03b1-synucleinopathies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) showed neuroprotective effects in toxin-induced PD-like neurodegeneration in rodents and, furthermore, resulted in a decreased AS aggregation in vitro. Recently, eicosanyl-5-hydroxytryptamide treatment lead to a repressed astro- and microglial activation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in AS-overexpressing mice. Moreover, different strategies on the inhibition of micro- and astroglial activation were followed in various experimental approaches leading to neuroprotection, including iNOS and NADPH oxidase inhibition, suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 pathway via pioglitazone or inhibition of the enzyme MPO, which is involved in ROS production and upregulated in PD and MSA. Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative known for its antimicrobial activity and the inhibition of protein synthesis, revealed additional anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-apoptotic efficacy. In different experimental studies of PD and MSA, minocycline had various neuroprotective effects probably dependent on the timing of therapy onset within the course of neurodegeneration. The modulation of TLR4-dependent microglial activation through a TLR4 antagonist naloxone has been suggested to prevent microgliosis-associated dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, in light of the recent finding that TLR4 is also an important modulator of AS clearance by microglia, caution and further studies are needed to justify such a therapeutic approach in \u03b1-synucleinopathies. Anti-neuroinflammatory strategies with the goal of modifying glial responses towards neuroprotection currently fail to translate into successful clinical trials. The application of NSAIDs in PD resulted in contradictory outcomes. In an epidemiological study, NSAID treatment was associated with decreased risk of PD; however, in a recent study using a UK cohort of PD cases and controls and in observational studies using meta-analysis, these results were not confirmed. A similar conflicting outcome was obtained after minocycline therapy in PD and MSA patients. Minocycline treatment of MSA patients in a prospective, randomised, double-blind clinical trial lead to a significant downregulation of microglial activation after 24 weeks of therapy; however, no effect on disease progression was demonstrated, suggesting that an early therapy onset may be preferable.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33120, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Alternative therapeutic strategies, like immunomodulation, AS-reducing strategies and neurotrophic factor delivery and modulation, targeting glial dysfunction have been approached. In an experimental immunisation study, the adoptive transfer of copolymer-1 immune cells resulted in decreased microglial activation and enhanced local expression of astroglia-associated GDNF amongst other effects. However, transfer of T cells from nitrated AS-immunised mice lead to neuroinflammation in correlation with neuronal loss. In contrast, AS vaccination in a PD mouse model yielded a decrease in microglial and astroglial activation and enhanced neuroprotection, as well as reduced AS inclusion pathology. The strategy of using AS-reducing agents for the therapy of \u03b1-synucleinopathies was further expanded by the application of rifampicin in a transgenic mouse model of MSA. The results indicated that the successful lowering of AS levels in the brain of MBP-AS mice resulted in neuroprotection associated with suppressed astroglial activation. Clinical proof of concept is currently awaited for the efficacy of these strategies. Finally, the delivery of neurotrophic factors is a relevant approach related to glial dysfunction in \u03b1-synucleinopathies. Genetically modified macrophages were used for the delivery of GDNF inducing neuroprotection in the MPTP model of PD.
