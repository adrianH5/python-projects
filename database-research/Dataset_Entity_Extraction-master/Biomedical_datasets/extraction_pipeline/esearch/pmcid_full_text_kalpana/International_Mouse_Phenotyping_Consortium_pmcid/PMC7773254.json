For the cases where LMM fails, PhenStat proceeds to an alternative method called Reference Range Plus (RR+). The RR+ method relies on an initial setting of a quantile, default 95% in PhenStat, to form the initial classes (Low/Normal/High) that discretises a continuous response based on the control, wild type (WT), mice population.

With ever-growing phenotypic data, more consideration is required for scalability and versatility of the statistical pipeline to model different possible scenarios as efficiently as possible. One challenge the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) faces is the diversity in data that demands more complex statistical methods with minimal latency. Here we introduced OpenStats, a freely available R package that allows systematically analysing different statistical scenarios in the high-throughput phenotypic data. The R package allows a fully customised analysis plan for the implemented methods namely: linear mixed model, Fisher\u2019s exact test and Reference Range plus, as well as a comprehensive workflow with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, scalability and completeness that offers more than the raw statistical results and more than the counterparts in the literature. The performance of the new software compared to the current implementation of the statistical pipeline in IMPC is assessed on more than 45M data points and 4M+ analyses. Our comparisons show on average 90% reduction in time spent by adopting the new software while 99% of the results remain similar between OpenStats and the closest counterpart, PhenStat, for the IMPC data. The speed efficiency of OpenStats lies in the fact that the software utilises a \u201cstart-update\u201d strategy instead of \u201cstart-terminate\u201d. That is, each model is formed by updating the previous one in contrast to fitting a brand-new model at each step. Besides the advantages of the software, there are a number of limitations to OpenStats including dependency to the statistical pipelines built on R and difficulties with exchanging the statistical methods with other statistical analysis software such as Python.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24096, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "OpenStats addresses other challenges beyond the need to scale/versatile analysis to large datasets. One example is irreproducibility in results from animal experiments that is cited as a major contributor to explain many drugs failure in the development pipeline. To address this concern, the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines have recently been updated to emphasis reporting on statistical methods including clearly stating the statistical method that is used and whether the data meet the assumptions of the statistical approach. As part of its operation, OpenStats assesses whether data fits the requirements for a statistical test, such as not having enough data for performing interaction tests in the linear mixed model or assessing the normality of input data/model residuals. OpenStats also provides the visualisation tools required to diagnose the fitted model. The resulting analyses are clearly defined by which method was used, promoting reproducibility and repeatability of the results and the statistical models.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25159, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Increasingly researchers and stakeholders such as funders are demanding that biological research data and their analyses follow the FAIR principles\u2014Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

It also provides semantic normalisation such as sex, Sex and gender to a unified term \u201cSex\u201d for common biological data variables in order to promote interoperability and reusability of data.
