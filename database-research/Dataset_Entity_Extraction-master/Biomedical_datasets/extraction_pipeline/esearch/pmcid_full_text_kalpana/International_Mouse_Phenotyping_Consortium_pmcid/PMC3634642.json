Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping data.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1940, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Strategic importance and value of embryonic phenotyping", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1996, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC; www.mousephenotype.org) aims to create 20,000 knockout (KO) mouse strains over the next 10 years, with viable strains undergoing comprehensive phenotyping as adult mice in order to identify the consequences of gene disruption. It is estimated that at least 30% of all KO strains will die during embryonic or perinatal periods and will not, therefore, pass through the adult phenotyping pipeline. However, systematic identification of such homozygous lethal KO lines presents the scientific community with a unique opportunity to study thousands of lethal phenotypes, unlocking a treasure trove of information relevant to gene function during embryonic growth, differentiation and organogenesis.

For example, mouse models have played a central role in our understanding of ciliopathies, for which the discovery of the relationship between cell signalling and cilia function has increased our understanding of a diverse spectrum of human diseases. Analysis of mouse embryonic lethal mutations has also resulted in the identification of new drug targets and intervention strategies. For instance, studying the neural tube defect in the lethal Grhl3 mouse mutant model led to novel inositol and folic acid combination therapies for the prevention of spina bifida, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as part of the PONTI study at University College London (UCL) (www.pontistudy.ich.ucl.ac.uk). Moreover, there have been substantial clinical impacts from fundamental observations of gene-dosage-sensitive embryonic lethality in delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4; encoding a Notch ligand) and vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) mouse mutants; the products of these genes are important factors driving angiogenesis, making them major therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5479, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A large proportion of homozygous lethal mutations also have clinical phenotypes as viable heterozygotes.

Below, we propose to establish a robust and high-throughput platform to screen intact mammalian embryos for such defects using imaging techniques. Second, it is impossible to consider one stage as optimal for the discovery of newly identified phenotypes. Each stage could reveal important discoveries into developmental processes, and the stage of particular interest for follow-up investigations will depend on the interest of the researcher.

When discussing the relative merits of a platform, an obvious driver is that whole-embryo coverage is obtained to ensure all organ systems are observed. Further considerations include spatial resolution and the importance of sufficient contrast to detect significant changes in morphology. For instance, in the case of MRI and micro X-ray computed tomography (\u03bcCT) imaging, the development of contrast reagents has helped enormously. A notable example is the use of inorganic iodine and phosphotungstic acid as contrast reagents in \u03bcCT imaging in order to increase the detection of soft tissues in mouse embryos. Another important concern is speed of acquisition of images, both to detect dynamic changes and for rapid collection of image volumes [e.g. by applying ultrasound or optical coherence tomography (OCT) ]. Additional considerations include operational workflow issues, complexity and time required for tissue preparation, image collection and throughput, capital and operational costs, and the robustness and scalability of the platform. This last point is crucial, particularly for newly emerging platforms that have yet to be validated for high-throughput embryo imaging. Consider the example of a relatively new platform called high resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM), which combines the \u2018gold standard\u2019 sensitivity and resolution of histopathology with 3D reconstruction. In this platform, embryos are embedded in plastic and serially sectioned, before each block face is imaged using a high-resolution digital camera. Serial sections can be assembled digitally, providing volume data that can be used to reconstruct embryos in 3D with the same cellular resolution as routinely obtained via histological sections (1 \u03bcm).

Lethality is defined as the lack of homozygous animals upon genotyping (usually near wean); at least 28 animals must be genotyped prior to calling a strain lethal at 95% confidence. Those that display less than 50% of the expected number of homozygotes (or 12.5% total) will be defined as \u2018sub-viable\u2019, although this is a qualitative assessment and not statistically significant. Both fully lethal and sub-viable strains can be flagged for embryonic lethal phenotyping, depending on the centres involved. The essential first step is to establish the approximate age of embryonic death for the expected 30% of lethal IMPC lines. A mid-gestational stage of embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) was recommended as a single initial reference time point, which provides the most information for subsequent analysis at different time points and can be efficiently combined with lacZ analysis. Based upon the findings at the E12.5 stage, the screen should then be triaged to either E9.5 (if there were no live homozygotes at E12.5) or E18.5 (if there was the expected number of homozygotes at E12.5). It is important to consider perinatal lethals, because they are expected to represent a large fraction (\u223c15%) of lethals. In addition, they are likely to represent excellent models for birth defects in humans, as evidenced by those linked to human neural tube defects. Triaging to stage E15.5 would follow if lethality was determined to occur in the E12.5\u2013E18.5 window. A minimum of 28 embryos per time point is recommended to provide 95% confidence for a \u2018lethal\u2019 call if no live homozygous embryos are identified at a particular stage (as above) and, assuming full penetrance of the phenotype, this number will also be sufficient to achieve at least seven homozygous mutants for phenotypic analysis.

First, at the simplest level they allow for visual comparison among individual images within a coherent space. Second, the extracted deformation fields can be used to identify displacements and volume changes between embryos.

Many human congenital anomalies show sex-dependent differences in prevalence, encouraging the analysis of both male and female lethal lines to gain insight into the mechanisms of these poorly understood sex differences.

Wild-type littermates (no lacZ) and ubiquitously expressing lacZ-positive control animals were recommended to be included in the analysis.

An excellent case study for coordinating operational and data quality-control workflows for a high-throughput multi-site embryo expression analysis has been demonstrated by the EUREXPRESS project. This project analysed over 18,000 genes and 400 microRNAs by oligo-based RNA in situ hybridisation on wild-type embryos (E14.5; cryosections). In keeping with the IMPC ideology, once they have passed the necessary quality-control measures, all data must be made freely available pre-publication through the IMPC database (www.impc.org).

Realistically, it will be impossible for a single IMPC production centre to provide enough embryological expertise and capacity to annotate every organ system in hundreds of animals, across multiple stages and under different imaging platforms. Our proposal organises embryonic phenotyping into tiers, wherein the first level of characterisation is within the capacity and expertise of the various centres. For the second level it is essential, therefore, to make datasets available in such a way that experts and general users can access the primary data for their own analysis. This will require the development and implementation of systems for handling very large image datasets, and for making them available to the user community for visualisation and analysis. To facilitate this, it is essential that centres should adopt common strategies for data collection, storage, quality control and transfer in order to create a common interface or portal for the internal and external community. The visualisation platforms and tools should be implementable independent of the imaging modality, overcoming the problem of having multiple imaging data types. Platform-independent 3D analysis tools are already well established in the biomedical imaging community and can be adopted for initial review by qualified embryologists as a crucial component of embryonic lethal analysis. However, mapping and annotating this information will need to be coordinated. A framework already exists for doing so, based on the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (http://www.emouseatlas.org). This portal allows the detailed 3D analysis of mouse anatomy and allows mapping of information (e.g. gene expression data from EUREXPRESS) onto anatomical structures in the developing mouse embryo. This takes advantage of sophisticated 3D computer models of mouse anatomy and histology across different developmental stages.

One outcome of the meeting was the agreement that not all MP terms exist for embryos, and the gaps need to be filled as a matter of priority. These will be posted on the IMPC website forum. Furthermore, a standard, minimum set of MP terms should be used for all lethal mutants at the various stages examined. This set of assembled terms captures phenotypes that can be assessed by gross morphological evaluation by trained non-experts, thereby maximising the number of centres that will be able to contribute to the data set.
