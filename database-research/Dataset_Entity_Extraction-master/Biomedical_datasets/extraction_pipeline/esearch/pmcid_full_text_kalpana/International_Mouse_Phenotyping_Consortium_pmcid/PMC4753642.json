The final corrected Cdh23\n753A>G(U1) gene sequence closely matches that found in these non-ARHL inbred strains at the nucleotide level, except for the two synonymous base substitutions (c.724A > T and c.725G > C; red text). The Cdh23\n753A>G(U1) product is predicted to be identical to the Cdh23 protein found in non-ARHL mouse strains. b Design 2 also utilises a 121\u00a0bp ssODN (ssODN_U2) in combination with two single guide RNAs, sgRNA_D1 also used in design 1 and sgRNA_U2, which lies across the Cdh23\nahl locus. The full ssODN_U2 donor sequence is shown below the C57BL/6NTac Cdh23\nahl sequence, with homology indicated by dashed lines, the Cdh23\nahl allele with an arrow, and one intronic base change shown in red text. The intronic base substitution is designed to prevent further modification by the CRISPR/Cas9 following repair. The final corrected Cdh23\n753A>G(U2) gene sequence is identical to that found in non-ARHL inbred strains at the nucleotide level, with only an intronic base substitution (c.753 + 9c > t; red text). The Cdh23\n753A>G(U2) product is predicted to be identical to the Cdh23 protein found in non-ARHL mouse strains", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19895, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Employing the Zhang Lab CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/), three protospacers (sgRNA_U1, sgRNA_U2 and sgRNA_D1) were selected allowing for two different designs (design 1, U1/D1, +42 nucleotide offset; and design 2, U2/D1, +13 nucleotide offset) (Fig.\u00a01). The criteria for protospacer sequence selection was based on the following previously suggested recommendations: double nicking resulting in 5\u2032 overhang; low potential off-target effects; as close as possible to the targeted nucleotide; and a short offset. In vitro assessment of these sgRNAs revealed that sgRNA_U1 and sgRNA_D1 both have a high efficacy for directing Cas9 nuclease activity (85\u00a0% and 88\u00a0% cleavage, respectively), whereas sgRNA_U2 has a lower efficacy (30\u00a0%) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As such, while design 1 employs two very efficient sgRNAs, the large offset will likely reduce the overall efficiency of this design. In comparison, for design 2 the offset distance is within the optimum range (\u22124 to +20), but it employs a less efficient sgRNA that will reduce the overall efficiency of this second design. Each design required a specific 121\u00a0bp ssODN to be synthesised with the desired correction (A > G) at their centre; these act as DNA donor templates for HDR. In addition to the Cdh23ahl allele correction, both ssODN templates also contain substitutions in the region complementary to the protospacer sequences (AG > TC in ssODN_U1 and C > T in ssODN_U2). These additional substitutions were added to prevent further modification by the CRISPR/Cas9 post HDR repair. In design 1, the AG > TC substitution does not change the encoded residue (AGT > TCT, Ser > Ser), and in design 2 the C > T substitution is within the intron (Fig.\u00a01).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21635, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Correction of the Cdh23ahl allele", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21669, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "Number of injected embryos, embryos transferred, pups born, and mutation rate", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21747, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table", "xml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th>Design</th><th>Cas9 (D10A) mRNA [conc] ng/\u03bcl</th><th>sgRNAs [conc] ng/\u03bcl (each)</th><th>ssODN [conc] ng/\u03bcl</th><th>Number of injected embryos</th><th>Lysed after injecting</th><th>Lysed (%)</th><th>Number of ET</th><th>Number of pups born</th><th>Born/injected (%)</th><th>Number of TG mice</th><th>Mutation rate (%)</th><th>Number of correct F<sub>0</sub> mice</th><th>Legitimate repair rate (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">1</td><td>100</td><td>50</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>3</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">12.5</td><td>21</td><td>11</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">45.8</td><td>1</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">9.1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>200</td><td>100</td><td>40</td><td>220</td><td>20</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">9.1</td><td>200</td><td>61</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">27.7</td><td>10</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">16.4</td><td>2</td><td>3.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">2</td><td>100</td><td>50</td><td>20</td><td>101</td><td>11</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">10.9</td><td>90</td><td>16</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">15.8</td><td>0</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">0.0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>200</td><td>100</td><td>40</td><td>111</td><td>4</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">3.6</td><td>107</td><td>16</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">14.4</td><td>4</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">25.0</td><td>2</td><td>12.5</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>456</td><td>38</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">8.3</td><td>418</td><td>104</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">22.8</td><td>15</td><td char=\".\" align=\"char\">14.4</td><td>4</td><td>3.8</td></tr></tbody></table>\n"}, "text": "Design\tCas9 (D10A) mRNA [conc] ng/\u03bcl\tsgRNAs [conc] ng/\u03bcl (each)\tssODN [conc] ng/\u03bcl\tNumber of injected embryos\tLysed after injecting\tLysed (%)\tNumber of ET\tNumber of pups born\tBorn/injected (%)\tNumber of TG mice\tMutation rate (%)\tNumber of correct F0 mice\tLegitimate repair rate (%)\t \t1\t100\t50\t20\t24\t3\t12.5\t21\t11\t45.8\t1\t9.1\t0\t0\t \t200\t100\t40\t220\t20\t9.1\t200\t61\t27.7\t10\t16.4\t2\t3.3\t \t2\t100\t50\t20\t101\t11\t10.9\t90\t16\t15.8\t0\t0.0\t0\t0\t \t200\t100\t40\t111\t4\t3.6\t107\t16\t14.4\t4\t25.0\t2\t12.5\t \t\t\t\t\t456\t38\t8.3\t418\t104\t22.8\t15\t14.4\t4\t3.8\t \t", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22270, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_foot"}, "text": "\nET embryos transferred, TG transgenic", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22309, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_foot"}, "text": "Generation of mice carrying the Cdh23\n753A>G repair using pronuclear injection of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents.

In order to increase the specificity of our system we decided to use the Cas9 mutant (D10A) double nicking system, which has been proposed to reduce the likelihood of \u2018off-target\u2019 mutations. Moreover, the sgRNAs used in this study were specifically selected as they show very few potential off-target sites, particularly on chromosome 10, which could not be easily segregated out through breeding, unlike off-target mutations on other chromosomes. Potential off-target binding sites for the design 1 guides were determined using the WTSI Genome Editing tool. When allowing up to four nucleotide mismatches, 55 and 173 off-target sites were predicted for sgRNA_U1 and sgRNA_D1, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S2). To assess the possibility of off-target Cas9-mediated damage, WGS was performed for the F0 used to establish the line that underwent phenotyping as part of this study. From approximately 152 million paired-end reads (150\u00a0bp), the alignment had a 9\u00d7 average read depth with 1.5\u00a0% assembly gaps. To enable the identification of CRISPR/Cas9-induced variants we also sequenced a WT C57BL/6NTac from our breeding colony. Sequence variants found to be common between the CRISPR/Cas9 F0, WT C57BL/6NTac, and those variants present in public repositories (including the Mouse Genomes Project and dbSNP) were eliminated from further analysis. Using a standard mutation detection tool we searched for potential sequence variations (SNVs and small indels) in the predicted off-target sites and surrounding the on-target site. No putative SNVs or indels were detected at any of the 228 predicted off-target sites examined (Table\u00a02). Due to the potential of mosaicism within the F0 mouse to confound the WGS data, we also assessed the F1 progeny for the presence of \u2018hidden\u2019 off-target damage transmitted through the germline. We amplified and Sanger sequenced the 14 most closely related off-target sites (three or fewer mismatches) predicted for sgRNA_U1 and sgRNA_D1 (Additional file 1: Table S3). No sequence variants were identified, confirming the high specificity of the double nicking system. In addition to the Cdh23753A>G repair edit, two additional genome edits were also added as part of design 1 (Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a03). All three edits were detected by WGS. To investigate the coding (missense, stop gain/loss and splice) mutation frequency in the F0 repaired Cdh23ahl/753A>G genome, we first used an automated SNV detection pipeline. This identified 42 potential coding SNVs. Subsequently we manually compared these with the WT C57BL/6NTac sequence and other mouse strains from our in-house sequence library. We found the majority of these coding SNVs (41) were present at low allele frequencies in more than two sequences or in regions with misaligned reads, and so were eliminated from further analysis. The one remaining coding SNV and six predicted false positives (randomly selected) were assessed using Sanger sequencing (Table\u00a03). Of these: four SNVs were found not to be present in the repaired Cdh23ahl/753A>G sequence and therefore confirmed as false positives; one SNV (Ubox5) was found to be present in both the WT C57BL/6NTac sequence and the repaired Cdh23ahl/753A>G sequence; one SNV remained undetermined due to the repetitive nature of the genomic locus (Vmn2r114); and one SNV (Fam184b) was found only in the repaired Cdh23ahl/753A>G sequence. Sanger sequencing of additional C57BL/6NTac mice from our WT stock identified that the Fam184b SNV is heterogeneously present, indicating that this mutation has recently arisen spontaneously within the colony (less than ten generations, as the WT C57BL/6NTac colony is restocked every ten generations from the supplier, Taconic Biosciences). This allele on chromosome 5 will be easily segregated from the repaired Cdh23ahl/753A>G allele located on chromosome 10.

While the loss includes both inner and outer hair cell bundles, the loss of outer hair cell bundles precedes and is more extensive than inner hair cell bundle loss.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35839, "infons": {"file": "13073_2016_273_Fig3_HTML.jpg", "id": "Fig3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "CRISPR-Cas9 mediated repair of the Cdh23\nahl allele in C57BL/6NTac mice preserves age-related high-frequency hearing and sensory hair cell stereocilia bundles. a ABR measurements from 24-week-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Cdh23\nahl/ahl) and their heterozygous \u2018repaired\u2019 C57BL/6NTac littermates (Cdh23\nahl/753A>G). As previously reported, by 24\u00a0weeks of age the WT Cdh23\nahl/ahl (n = 17) mice show elevated hearing thresholds (>60\u00a0dB SPL) for the 32\u00a0kHz stimulus, the highest frequency tested. However, at 24\u00a0weeks of age the Cdh23\nahl/753A>G (n = 13) littermates do not have elevated thresholds at 32\u00a0kHz, but instead display thresholds similar to those measured for the 8 and 16\u00a0kHz stimuli (~20\u201335\u00a0dB SPL). b By 36\u00a0weeks of age the Cdh23\nahl/ahlmice (n = 12) have very elevated hearing thresholds (\u226580\u00a0dB SPL) for the 32\u00a0kHz stimulus, showing progression of the high-frequency hearing impairment. However, at 36\u00a0weeks of age the Cdh23\nahl/753A>G littermate mice (n = 9) still exhibit hearing thresholds within the normal range (~20\u201335\u00a0dB SPL) for all frequencies tested (8, 16 and 32\u00a0kHz).
