Supporting this, we found that expression of the closely adjacent Tk gene in homozygous tm1b Afmid mice was approximately 50% reduced in kidney and about 90% reduced in liver, indicating that regulation of this gene was disrupted by deleting exon 2 of Afmid and replacing it with a LacZ reporter. Previous reports of fatal kidney disease in Afmid and Tk double knockouts is in contrast to Afmid tm1b mice that did not exhibit any renal phenotypes. Given that both models lack Afmid expression it is likely that the renal phenotype in double knockout mice is due to a lack of TK activity and that our model retains sufficient TK activity to be healthy. Alternatively, defects in both genes could act synergistically to cause disease in sensitive tissues or a potential developmental defect. Thymidine kinase is required for thymidine nucleotide salvage for use in DNA synthesis and repair, whilst the Afmid block may affect the first rate-limiting step of tryptophan degradation that is superoxide consuming and generates formyl kynurenine for conversion by AFMID. A testable hypothesis would be that Afmid knockout results in disruption of the kynurenine pathway leading to DNA damage, possibly by superoxide, and in the case of Tk deficiencies abnormalities in repair that lead to cellular dysfunction in susceptible tissues and cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20545, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The male Afmidtm1b/tm1b mice retain normal insulin sensitivity and the impaired glucose tolerance is likely caused by a defect in both first and second phase insulin secretion as measured in isolated perifused islets. The trend for reduced tolbutamide induced insulin secretion suggests the defect is downstream of the KATP channel as this agent closes the channel and should stimulate secretion. The lack of impaired glucose tolerance in Afmidtm1b/tm1b female mice may be due to a protective hormonal affect. Histologically we also observed loss of islet number in male Afmidtm1b/tm1b mice in comparison with Afmid+/+ littermates. Histological analysis of the double knockout pancreas has similarly been reported to be deficient in islets. Consistent with an insulin secretory defect a number of studies have linked KYN metabolites with impaired insulin secretion in vitro. Furthermore, that xanthurenic acid binds to circulating insulin and prevents the hormone binding to cells, although we have not observed insulin resistance in our model. NMR analysis of urine showed the presence of both kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid in Afmidtm1b/tm1b mice and therefore it is possible that the loss of islet number may be due to a toxicity effect halting development of these particular cells rather than apoptosis as there was no morphological evidence of cell death. Alternatively, KYN metabolites may exert a physiological effect on islet cells suppressing insulin secretion.
