Key to this new era will be the exploration of pleiotropy, the multiple functions of genes. Historically, phenotype testing has reflected the interests and experience of the individual investigator and the study of mouse mutants of interest. Thus, the current phenotype datasets are patchy and are not fit for the task of building a systems-based view of genetic networks.

The expectation is that a single cohort of mice for each mutant will proceed through all pipeline tests. It follows that once a cohort of mice has been created for phenotype testing, there are considerable economies to be achieved in maximising the phenotypic areas explored, and the use of additional tests comes at a very modest increase in cost: mouse generation and breeding represent by far the greatest cost in large-scale phenotyping.
