We found that in studies focused on the function of endogenously-express P2Y14, the potency of UDP-sugars was two orders of magnitude lower compared to the studies reporting results from heterologous expression systems (Figure 7a). When the data from more detailed experiments on exogenously expressed P2Y14 was examined (Figure 7b\u2013d), no differences were observed between the responses of P2Y14 from human, mouse, or rat (Figure 7b), or when distinct UDP-sugars were applied (Figure 7c). However, EC50 for different signalling outcomes downstream of exogenously expressed P2Y14 varied by orders of magnitude, ranging from 12.6 nM (95% CI: 7.04, 22.5) for calcium signalling, to 81.9 nM (95% CI: 45.6, 147) for cAMP inhibition, to 341 nM (95% CI: 232 to 502) for IP3 accumulation.

The difference between endogenously and exogenously expressed receptors may suggest that P2Y14 signalling is regulated by post-translational modifications. It was previously suggested that P2Y14-mediated calcium signalling is related to P2Y14 glycosylation since in glioma C6 cells only N-glycosylated P2Y14 was able to induce [Ca2+]i elevations. Moreover, it was shown that synthetic and microbial UDPG preparations induced different responses in N9 microglial cells: 15 \u00b5M synthetic UDPG inhibited phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), thereby indicating reduced cAMP levels, while 15 \u00b5M microbial UDPG had no effect.

However, upon observing similar potentiating effects in UDPG-insensitive C2-Ob cells, we realized that this potentiation was unlikely to be UDPG-dependent.

Third, PPTN likely inhibited UDPG-mediated [Ca2+]i responses in CB-Ob, but this was masked by the potentiation of mechanically-induced responses. Consistent with this observation, we also found that inhibition of P2Y14 potentiated [Ca2+]i responses to severe mechanical stimulation and ATP and ADP stimulation. It is possible that stronger responses to ATP and ADP were due to an additive contribution of unaffected P2R signalling and increased [Ca2+]i responses to mechanical perturbations introduced during agonist application; however, disproportionate increases in cellular responsiveness to higher concentrations of both ligands suggest that potentiation of P2R signalling is likely.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22491, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among the P2 receptor family, the P2Y13 receptor is another P2 receptor that has been implicated as a negative modulator of mechanically-induced osteogenesis.

P2Y14 knockdown in bone-marrow-derived monocytes significantly impaired RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, while UDPG application promoted osteoclast formation in vitro. Evidence from in vitro osteoblast and osteoclast cultures suggests that in vivo P2Y14 deficiency would result in an osteopetrotic phenotype predominantly driven by impaired osteoclast formation. While there were no discernable differences in bone mineral density or content were observed in P2ry14-/- mice, this does not dismiss the possibility that skeletal microarchitecture (i.e., trabecular number, separation, thickness, etc.) is affected in these mice, and future histomorphometry and \u00b5CT analysis is needed to validate these findings. It is also possible that bone-embedded osteocytes which express P2Y14 but remain uncharacterized provide additional P2Y14-mediated contributions. Alternatively, other P2Y14-dependent functions, particularly in immunity and inflammation may mask the predicted phenotype in P2ry14-/- mice.

Study Limitations and Future Directions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25355, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study has several noteworthy limitations. First, we characterized the role of P2Y14 through pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout and through these complementary approaches we identified certain inconsistencies. Whether this relates to varying degrees of intervention specificity or differences in acute versus chronic P2Y14 impairment is unclear. Overexpression studies\u2014which to date are lacking\u2014would help clarify outstanding questions (e.g., does P2Y14 overexpression attenuate cellular responsiveness to mechanical stimulation?) and provide insights into the complete spectrum of cellular effects that are mediated by P2Y14 receptor. Secondly, we have implicated P2Y14 in the modulation of mechanotransduction signalling, however, our study was limited to in vitro experiments, and we did not elucidate the mechanism by which this is achieved or how this influences the mechano-adaptive skeletal response in vivo. It is known that the cytoskeleton is intimately linked to mechano-sensitivity, and further work examining the link between P2Y14 modulation and the cytoskeleton may be warranted. Additionally, it will be necessary to evaluate the skeletal response to controlled mechanical loading in Wt and P2ry14-/- mice. Thirdly, we have demonstrated that P2Y14 is functionally expressed in osteoblasts through inhibition and knockout, but the response to UDPG varies between osteoblast models and does not evoke a complete response in certain pathways that are known to be functionally coupled to P2Y14. Further work is needed to determine whether UDPG is released by osteoblasts. Additionally, it will be pertinent to determine whether other UDP-sugars, such as UDP-galactose, are active agonists for P2Y14 in bone cells.

Using two osteoblast models, we demonstrated the effects of P2Y14 inhibition are consistently more pronounced and discernable than those induced by UDPG treatment, indicating that certain P2Y14-mediated effects, including AC inhibition (C2-Ob and CB-Ob), may not be inducible by endogenous ligand stimulation. Importantly, we showed for the first time that P2Y14-inhibition results in hypersensitivity to mechanical and purinergic stimulation, reflecting a possible modulatory role for P2Y14 in mechanotransductive purinergic signalling. Functionally, P2Y14 signalling regulated osteoblast proliferation and the timing of collagen synthesis and deposition during differentiation. P2Y14-deficient mice exhibited a mild skeletal phenotype with elongated tibiae and no differences in bone mineral density. Our findings demonstrate a modulatory role for P2Y14 in osteoblasts and furthers our understanding of how the P2 receptor network integrates mechanical and purinergic signals in the bone.
