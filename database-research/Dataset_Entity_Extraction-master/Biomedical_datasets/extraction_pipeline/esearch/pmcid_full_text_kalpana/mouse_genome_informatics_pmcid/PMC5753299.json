The analytical workflows used by these separate projects are conceptually similar in that they both produce gene annotations based on a combination of computational pipelines and manual curation, largely based on the interpretation of transcriptomics and other experimental data. Ultimately, however, Ensembl and NCBI have developed different rules and guidelines for automated and manual annotation or curation, and this has led to differences between the sets of genes, transcripts and proteins currently found in these datasets. Such inconsistencies can present a challenge to the scientific community in their efforts to interpret biological data; for example, when a disease-associated variant is found to occur in a protein-coding transcript in one dataset, but a non-coding model in another.

Since the first human and mouse data releases in 2005 and 2006, respectively, the CCDS dataset has seen a steady growth in the number of new coding regions (CCDS IDs) as well as the number of genes that have at least one CCDS ID in both the human (Figure 1A) and mouse (Figure 1B) datasets. This growth reflects increasing concordance in NCBI and Ensembl protein-coding region annotations over the years. The most recent CCDS releases in human (Release 20) and mouse (Release 21) contain 32 524 and 25 757 CCDS IDs represented by 18 892 and 20 354 genes, respectively, and cover \u223c33.2 Mb (1.03%) of the human and 33.7 Mb (1.24%) of the mouse reference genomes. Notably, the growth in recent years is largely due to the addition of new CCDS IDs representing alternatively spliced transcripts within existing protein-coding genes, and this trend has continued unabated up to the current human and mouse releases. This is evident from Figure 2, which shows a growing trend in the fraction of total genes in the CCDS dataset that are represented by at least two protein isoforms in both the mouse and the human CCDS sets. The increase in detectable splicing variation can be attributed to the identical annotation of alternatively spliced transcript variants resulting from the incorporation of new data types into automated pipelines, as well as curation workflows of the two annotation groups. It also likely reflects an end to the locus-by-locus \u2018growth phase\u2019 of human annotation as both annotation groups have manually annotated most human genes in their respective annotation catalogs, and are expected to reach the same goal in mouse annotation in the next few years.

Table 1 summarizes the different categories of review status with a brief description of each category. The review status depends on manual review carried out at two levels. The first level of review is performed by curators in the individual annotation groups who review genes, transcripts and proteins as a part of their manual annotation process, and this review is independent of the CCDS workflow.

A notable example of the benefit of cooperative expert curation is reflected in the updated annotation of human MIA2 and CTAGE5 and their mouse orthologs, following a discussion of these genes by the CCDS collaboration, prompted by a review request from the UniProt group. These genome features were annotated as independent genes by NCBI (Annotation Release 108) and Ensembl (Release 85). CCDS collaborators merged the two genes into a single gene, MIA2, based on published data on the human and mouse genes, direct consultations with the research groups and new data submitted to INSDC (KX388743.1, representing the TANGO1-like transcript, TALI, which contains both MIA2-specific and CTAGE5-specific exons). The CTAGE5 protein was retained as a splice variant of MIA2 and a new transcript variant (RefSeq transcript NM_001329214.2; Ensembl transcript ENST00000640607.1), based on TALI, was created. Similar changes were made in the representation of the mouse Mia2 gene as well. Following these changes, the nomenclature groups agreed to merge their records and retain the symbol MIA2 and Mia2, for the human and mouse genes, respectively. Such annotation changes made by CCDS curators are reflected in the subsequent updates of the NCBI and Ensembl genome annotations.

For example, curators recently reviewed a list of around 250 genes that are annotated by both Ensembl and NCBI, but have different gene biotypes (typically protein-coding versus pseudogene versus long non-coding RNA). As a result of this review, both annotation groups agreed on consistent gene biotypes for about 70 genes. Where disagreements remain, a common factor is the lack of sufficient transcriptomic or proteomic evidence to confirm or confidently suggest a biotype. These cases will be subject to iterative review as additional data become available. A second task involved the review of genes (86 human and 130 mouse genes) that were represented in the CCDS database, but had differing gene symbols in the NCBI and Ensembl databases. This review led to the correction of gene symbols in both annotation sets based on standard names provided by the respective nomenclature authorities. Last year, the CCDS collaborators undertook a review of human-mouse orthologs to ensure that both orthologs were represented in the CCDS dataset when supporting data were available.

Such cases are naturally a top priority for review by the CCDS curators. In particular, the interpretation of genes predicted to encode small proteins or small open reading frames (smORFs) and non-coding RNAs pose challenges for gene annotation, and thereby pose challenges for the completion of the CCDS dataset. Interpretation of new datasets including ribosome profiling, cross-species conservation, evolutionary conservation of synonymous codons in ORFs and mass spectrometry promises to help resolve some of the uncertainty about these genes.
