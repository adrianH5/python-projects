The 2021 international guidelines for the management of septic shock defined sepsis as life\u2010threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated response to infection. The lung is one of the earliest and most easily affected organs among the various organ functions of the human body. The clinical manifestations are mainly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is one of the most common acute and serious illnesses in the field of critical medicine, with a fatality rate of over 40%. Although significant progress has been made in the understanding and treatment of ARDS pathophysiology in the past 50 years, the mechanism of acute lung injury caused by sepsis is still not fully understood, and there are still no specific biomarkers and effective prevention and treatment targets. Studies have shown that ARDS lung injury is characterized by inflammatory processes demonstrated as loss of function of the pulmonary capillary endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells. Autophagy is an intracellular digestion system that work as an inducible adaptive response to lung injury which is a resultant of exposure to various stress agents like hypoxia, sepsis, ischemia\u2010reperfusion, and xenobiotics which may be manifested as acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS, asthma, ventilator\u2010induced lung injury (VILI), pulmonary fibrosis. Numerous regulators like LC3B\u2010II, Beclin 1, p62, HIF1/BNIP3, and mTOR may play pivotal role in autophagy induction during lung injury for progression/inhibition of the disease state. However, the mechanism of autophagy in septic ARDS lung injury is still unclear. In this study, we used RNA\u2010seq technology to screen the autophagy\u2010related genes and pathways involved in the process of lung injury caused by exogenous factors in sepsis\u2010induced ARDS.

Due to the complex and diverse mechanism of exogenous lung injury in sepsis, the exact mechanism is not fully understood.

According to the set screening conditions, we identified 42 autophagy\u2010related DEGs (26 upregulated and 16 downregulated). Autophagy may play a role in regulating the occurrence and development of inflammation by activating the release of intracellular chemokines, inflammatory mediators, and cytokines through related signaling pathways, such as JAK\u2010STAT signaling pathway, HIF\u20101 signaling pathway, and toxoplasmosis. In the PPI interaction analysis of 42 differential genes, we identified a total of 42 node proteins, 75 interaction edges, and an average node degree of 3.52, indicating that these proteins have a greater level of interaction than what would be expected for a random set of proteins of the same size and degree distribution drawn from the genome.

Among the top 10 hub genes, Nod2, Stat3, Hif1a, Hmox1, and Ifng were validated by qRT\u2010PCR and shown to be clearly associated with autophagy, playing an important role in the biological activity that leads to ARDS lung injury.

Autophagy can promote cell survival by accelerating cellular metabolism and helping cells adapt to the environment, although this process, in which most of the organelles and cytoplasm in the cell are engulfed, also leads to a form of cell death. Autophagy is known as type II cell death, whereas apoptosis, which is a type of programmed cell death known as type I cell death. In this study, GSEA analysis showed that both autophagy\u2010 and apoptosis\u2010related genes were upregulated in the ARDS lung injury group (Figure\u00a02C,D) and had significant biological functions. The emergence of autophagy either as a protective role or maladaptive response due to sepsis. It was ensured autophagy to be a protective response. Yet, an overexpression of signal transducers and activators of transcriptions (STATs) in the severe sepsis leads to ALI, describing a maladaptive role. Lung injury can be provoked by ischemia/reperfusion, in which autophagy is stated as the safeguarding mechanism by moderately maintaining the level of Stat3. In normal cells, Stat3 activation by phosphorylation is tightly controlled to avoid abnormal gene expression. However, Stat3 phosphorylation reached its peak at 15\u201360\u2009min after stimulation by factors such as cytokines IL\u20106, IL\u20108, and TNF\u2010\u03b1. Stat3 activation also plays an important role in cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, as well as angiogenesis and inflammatory response. Activated Stat3 forms a dimer that enters the nucleus, binds with the downstream Cyclin D1, Cyclin B and cdc2 promoters to initiate transcription, and promote cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. In addition, activated Stat3 also promotes the survival of injured cells and inhibits apoptosis by regulating the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as Survivin, Bcl\u20102, Bcl\u2010xL, and Mcl\u20101.

Hif1 comprises of two subunits, Hif1\u03b1 and Hif1\u03b2. Hif1\u03b1 shows unique response to oxygen and expressed during hypoxic conditions while Hif1\u03b2, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor\u2010nuclear translocator, is expressed during normoxic conditions espectively. BNIP3 is a unique member that comes under BH3\u2010only Bcl\u20102 family. It consist two major domains namely transmembrane domain (TM) and PEST domain. Hif1 stabilization acts to express BNIP3 genes and it is known to be a highly regulated process as BNIP3 overexpression may lead to cell death. Cellular stresses developed on exposure to toxic substances like nitric oxide, Lipopolysaccharide, cyanide triggers Hif1\u2010regulated BNIP3 expression respectively. BNIP3 possesses the ability to provoke cell death via autophagy and apoptosis. Moreover, in the hypoxia and ischemia\u2010reperfusion conditions induced by septic ARDS, Hif1 plays a protective role in tissue cells by regulating the expression of heme oxygenase 1(Hmox1), and the Hif1a\u2010Hmox1 axis plays a key role in autophagy induction and inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Also, it has previously been shown that Hmox1\u2010generated carbon monoxide (CO) is required for the induction of autophagy and killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages in response to immunomodulation by Ifng. Interestingly, Ifng exposure of macrophages induces an increase in intracellular calcium levels that is dependent on Hmox1\u2010generated CO. Furthermore, chelation of intracellular calcium inhibits Ifng\u2010mediated autophagy and mycobacterial clearance from macrophages. These observations suggest that the induction of autophagy is dependent on Hmox1.

It is currently believed that the Nod2 receptor is significantly upregulated and promotes autophagy in alveolar macrophages is a component of ARDS pathology. Using a model of lung injury induced by injecting muramyl dipeptide into the airway of mice, Wen et al. showed that the HMGB1/TLR4 signaling pathway was activated, thereby upregulating Nod2 receptors in alveolar macrophages, and further increasing the expression of autophagy\u2010related protein Lc3 in alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, Lc3 expression decreased significantly after Nod2 knockout. These findings suggest that upregulation of the Nod2 receptor expression can promote autophagy in alveolar macrophages. These phenomena suggest that the HMGB1/TLR4 signaling pathway activation during lung injury upregulates Nod2 expression to induce autophagy in alveolar macrophages.
