This information is also vital in choosing prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers, particularly for multifactorial diseases such as heart disease that might benefit from measurement of multiple biomarkers. Recent improvements in omic technologies have led to projects such as the 100\u2009000 Genomes Project and genome-wide association studies, which are producing vast amounts of genetic data pertinent to human health. Furthermore, it is now possible to catalog which proteins or RNAs are present in normal or disease tissues, or individual cells. Understanding the molecular network or biological processes associated with a drug target can help predict off-target effects or the potential for drug repurposing because many gene products are active in multiple pathways. In addition, these networks can be used to predict the most efficacious molecules within the networks, through the identification of key positions at which the whole networks may be perturbed; these molecules are often associated with disease-causing mutations or identified as drug targets. One of the major resources used by omic researchers is the Gene Ontology.

To gain insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia, high-throughput genome-scale methodologies (including genome-wide association studies [GWAS], transcriptomics, exon sequencing, and proteomics) are being used. However, interpretation of these high-throughput experiments relying on descriptions of the cellular and physiological roles of gene products, and a computational approach to interrogation of cardiac gene function, is a bottleneck in these analyses. Our work aims to fill this gap by capturing information in the Gene Ontology (GO) resource in a structured way, thus integrating knowledge about genes, cells, tissues and organs. To support data interpretation, the GO Consortium (GOC) provides a freely available, structured, controlled vocabulary, the ontology, that enables association of defined terms, describing cellular roles and locations, with a protein or RNA. This association process, called GO annotation, provides a computer-interpretable summary of the results of many independent experiments. GO terms describe Molecular Functions (molecular activities of a gene product), Biological Processes (the broader context in which a gene product acts), and Cellular Components (the subcellular location of a gene product).

However, other approaches, such as those described by MacArthur et al, may also be valuable.

This approach can be easily undertaken using GO annotation data, and yet it is rarely included in the in silico investigations of GWAS results. After our focused annotation effort, the ability to use GO annotations to identify candidate genes associated with arrhythmia disorders was evaluated. Human proteins associated with 9 GO terms that are relevant to normal cardiac physiology were downloaded using QuickGO (GO terms are shown in Table IV in the Data Supplement). The corresponding genes were then compared with Mendelian genes for arrhythmia disorders (atrial fibrillation, long-QT syndrome, short-QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome) and with GWAS candidate variants associated with QT interval length and atrial fibrillation risk loci, described by Tucker et al and Arking et al. Of 45 Mendelian arrhythmia-associated genes (described in 3 reviews to 2015), 43 were annotated with \u22651 of the cardiac-relevant GO terms (Table II in the Data Supplement), with SRL and GREM2 being the exceptions. The GO annotations associated with the 83 GWAS-identified candidate genes (associated with 48 risk loci) suggest that GO data can contribute to prioritization of candidate risk genes. Cardiac physiology-relevant GO terms suggest the prioritization of 36 of the 83 candidate genes. This selection approach compares favorably with that taken by Arking et al. In that study, authors identified 35 common variant QT interval loci and used expression quantitative trait loci, protein interaction, and coimmunoprecipitation data to identify 70 candidate genes associated with these loci (Table II in the Data Supplement). Both the GO and the expression quantitative trait loci approaches suggest 27 QT interval candidate genes, whereas coimmunoprecipitation suggests 12 genes and in silico protein interaction networks 15 genes. For example, GO annotations hint that RNF207, at 1p36, is a good candidate for variations in QT interval length, with annotations to 6 of the key GO terms, and that potassium transport-associated KCNAB2 is a good alternative candidate. In contrast, in silico protein interaction data support 3 other genes at this locus (ACOT7, KCNAB2, and RPL22; Table 2). Similarly, GO annotation information narrows the candidates at the 3p21 locus to 3 genes (MYL3, SCAP, and SETD2; Table 2), with MYL3 having the strongest annotation support, because of its role in muscle contraction and heart development; the analysis provided by Arking et al suggested 5 candidate genes at this locus.

A VCM transcriptomic data set was used to investigate this, as we anticipated that a ventricular-specific transcriptome was likely to include the ion channels, and their regulators, required for cardiac repolarization and depolarization. Poon et al profiled the transcriptome of human embryonic stem cells and compared this to the transcriptome of adult human VCMs, after filtering out the transcripts that were not significantly differentially expressed between the 2 cell types. Poon et al found that GO terms describing translation elongation, as well as muscle system, contraction, and energy generation (their wording), were enriched within the 200 most abundant transcripts in adult human VCMs. Our analysis using the 2011 and 2016 GO annotation data sets confirms findings of Poon et al, with the majority of these proteins annotated to either muscle contraction, mitochondrion organization, respiratory electron transport chain, gene expression, or developmental process terms. Notably, our analysis also demonstrates that the terms cardiac conduction, regulation of cardiac conduction, and regulation of the force of heart contraction (among others) were significantly enriched in the 2016 analysis. Although VCMs are not involved in cardiac conduction, it is not unexpected that cardiac conduction and child terms will be enriched in a ventricular data set, because many of the same action potential-associated proteins are present in ventricular, atrial, and conduction tissues. The identification of the cardiac-specific terms within this data set does, however, confirm that the GO terms and annotations created by this focused project are sufficient to enable the identification of the increased expression of genes involved in these processes. In 2011, many of the cardiac physiology GO terms did not exist, and consequently, these terms are (understandably) not enriched using the 2011 annotation data set (Table 3; Table V in the Data Supplement).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29155, "infons": {"file": null, "id": "T3", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "Comparison of Functional Analysis of Adult Ventricular Cardiomyocyte Data3 Using Gene Ontology (Full List of Enriched Terms in Table V in the Data Supplement)", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29314, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29325, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this article, we describe work to improve the GO resource in representing relevant cardiac processes, and in capturing roles of gene products from published literature through GO annotation. The majority of publications describing heart or cardiomyocyte transcriptomic and proteomic data sets use GO annotations to investigate the pathways associated with this important organ. We tested whether our recent cardiac-relevant annotations could be used to support a more informative interpretation of high-throughput studies. Our reanalysis of the top 200 differentially expressed transcripts in adult human VCMs (compared with the human embryonic stem cells transcriptome; Table V in the Data Supplement) confirms the original findings of Poon et al and, in addition, shows that the transcriptome of these cells is enriched for GO terms referring to cardiac physiology, including cardiac conduction, regulation of cardiac conduction, regulation of cardiac muscle contraction by calcium ion signaling, and regulation of the force of heart contraction. Notably, the enrichment of these terms is only possible because of the expansion of the GO resource in this area. These cardiac-relevant terms are identified despite more than half of these highly expressed proteins being associated with protein synthesis, mitochondrial respiratory systems, or having a structural cellular role. The significance of our work lies in the enhanced ability to identify cardiac-relevant genes within cardiac tissue; cardiac physiologists can now use the GO to test genomic profiles and confirm the presence of relevant genes. For example, researchers who are using in vitro cardiac cell differentiation systems can now test the profiles of gene expression in their cells to examine and confirm progression toward mature cardiomyocytes.

In particular, our results suggest that ATP1B1, a Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b2-subunit, is the most likely candidate gene for further study at the 1q24 risk locus because it is associated with cardiac-relevant GO annotations.

The Drosophila pulsatile heart tube, with its anterior aorta, looks structurally very distinct from the zebrafish 2-chambered and the mammalian 4-chambered hearts. However, despite this, many of the new GO terms created during this project can be applied across all species because many orthologous genes have similar functions. The major limiting factor to the GO annotation of nonmammalian systems is the paucity of research describing the roles of individual gene products in the cardiac cycle in those species, as the majority of these data relate to mammals.

This effort was enhanced by the collaboration with experts in the cardiac research field who helped us identify key aspects of the process, key genes, and key publications on which to focus. As knowledge of the cardiac system continues to advance, there will be opportunities to capture additional cardiac information in GO. We have provided a structured framework for the addition of new knowledge to the resource, for example, to better describe information about the proteins involved in the mechanical aspect of the heart, and to fully capture roles of gene products and hormones in regulating cardiac physiology. Our work also shows that collaboration between groups developing ontologies and creating biological annotations and scientists and clinicians engaged in active research can lead to substantial improvements in the computational representation of biological knowledge.
