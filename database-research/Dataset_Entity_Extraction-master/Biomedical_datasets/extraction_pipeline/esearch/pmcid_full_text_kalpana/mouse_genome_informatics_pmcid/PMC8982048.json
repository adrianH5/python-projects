Ontology analysis tools are imperative in finding functional similarities through overrepresentation or enrichment of terms associated with the input gene or protein lists. However, most tools are limited by their ability to do ontology-specific and species-limited analyses. Furthermore, some enrichment tools are not updated frequently with recent information from databases, thus giving users inaccurate, outdated or uninformative data. Here, we present MOET or the Multi-Ontology Enrichment Tool (v.1 released in April 2019 and v.2 released in May 2021), an ontology analysis tool leveraging data that the Rat Genome Database (RGD) integrated from in-house expert curation and external databases including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), The Gene Ontology Resource, UniProt-GOA, and others. Given a gene or protein list, MOET analysis identifies significantly overrepresented ontology terms using a hypergeometric test and provides nominal and Bonferroni corrected P-values and odds ratios for the overrepresented terms. The results are shown as a downloadable list of terms with and without Bonferroni correction, and a graph of the P-values and number of annotated genes for each term in the list.

The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium was developed as a resource to describe and curate functional similarities for such data to make meaningful interpretations and to computationally represent the current knowledge. GO creates a standardized vocabulary to define the biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions associated with the gene. Currently, GO provides over 7 million annotations across multiple organisms. These GO terms can be used for gene set enrichment analysis, which is a widely used process to statistically identify terms that are significantly overrepresented or enriched within a list of input genes or proteins.

A few ontology analysis tools require knowledge of specific programming languages, such as R (e.g. DOSE, GSEA) or Python (e.g. GOATools), or have operating system-specific requirements (e.g. FunRich), making them inconvenient for some users.

The comparison provided in this work used a gene set derived from DEGs found between a rat strain representing a model of metabolic syndrome (LH) and a control strain (LN).

One source of difference could be that DAVID, PANTHER, GSEA, and MOET are based on different algorithms and use different methods for multiple testing corrections (Supplementary Table S1). Differences in the number of annotations and P-values between these tools can be attributed to some of the benefits that are unique to MOET. The continuing updates in ontology and annotations cause differences in significance values as new parent-child relationships increase the number of annotations to a term. Since MOET draws its underlying data directly from the RGD database, which is updated on a weekly basis, it has the most up-to-date ontologies and annotations resulting in the most accurate significance values. Another unique feature of MOET is its algorithm that includes only the genes in the selected species annotated to the selected ontology as the reference set.
