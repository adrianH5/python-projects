Just as careful documentation of scientific methodology can allow other investigators to understand or reproduce an experiment, describing the scientific evidence associated with a given assertion or inference allows for its meaningful assessment. Many of the data that are used to support assertions are experimentally derived in a laboratory or field setting. However, assertions are also commonly made based on computational analysis of large data sets, implied by known biology and captured during literature curation, or even synthesized from investigator speculation. Because types of evidence can vary, it is essential to document this information to allow others to draw meaningful and appropriate conclusions. There are numerous practical benefits gained by capturing evidence. One simple but essential benefit is the ability to query a database for an annotation (an assertion about a gene product) based on a particular type of evidence. In addition, an effective evidence capture system can be used as a mechanism for filtering search results, for establishing computable rules about what data types should be associated with what types of evidence and to flag particular chains of inference that might require further review (e.g. those based purely on computational methods with no experimental verification).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2981, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A central goal of biological curation systems is to associate biological entities with descriptive information. This is achieved through curating annotations. Optimally, the associated information, i.e. the annotation, is represented with terms from a descriptive vocabulary. To document the evidence for a scientific conclusion (such as the assertion that \u2018this protein has function x\u2019), the assertion must be linked to an appropriate term that describes the evidence supporting the conclusion (such as \u2018enzymatic assay\u2019). It is possible to connect any number of evidence types with a wide range of experimentally or computationally supported assertions. However, for this to be practical, a structured, well-defined and expansive vocabulary that captures the types of evidence is needed. Ontologies are particularly well suited to this task. Ontologies allow for the detailed description of things that exist within a particular knowledge domain and provide a structural framework with relationships among descriptive terms. This enables categorization of descriptions at different levels of specificity and facilitates retrieval of data associated with ontology terms in an interpretable and computable fashion. There are numerous examples of biological ontologies in active use. These include ontologies for phenotype, cell type, anatomy and many more. Probably the most well-known and successful is the Gene Ontology (GO) used to describe the functions, processes or cellular locations in which gene products participate or are found. Here we describe the Evidence Ontology (ECO), developed to characterize a range of evidence types in support of scientific conclusions.

Use of ECO terms can effectively allow automated quality control checks to insure that all required information is supplied for a given type of annotation. In addition, evidence types are also used by GO as a quality control check for annotation consistency. For example, the GO restricts usage of evidence based on expression pattern to annotations with terms from the biological process ontology. Thus, annotations to terms from either of the other two GO ontologies (molecular function and cellular component) would be flagged as suspect. In a final example, the GO uses evidence tracking to prevent circular annotations grounded only in computational predictions. Evidence tracking allows chains of evidence to be computationally examined to insure that experimental evidence forms the basis for inferential annotations.

This phylogenetic annotation methodology necessitated a new set of evidence terms to capture the inference process. These phylogenetic evidence types are biological aspect of ancestor (GO IBA or ECO:0000318 \u2018biological aspect of ancestor evidence used in manual assertion\u2019), where the biological characteristics in descendent sequences are inferred from the biological characteristics of the ancestral sequence, and conversely, biological aspect of descendant (GO IBD or ECO:0000319 \u2018biological aspect of descendant evidence used in manual assertion\u2019), whereby the characteristics of an ancestral sequence are inferred through the experimental characterization of an extant descendant sequence.

The Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP; http://microbialphenotypes.org, manuscript in preparation) has been developed to standardize phenotypic information capture for diverse microbes. There are numerous classes of evidence associated with the study of microbes including evidence resulting from growth assays, motility assays, biochemical tests and antibiotic resistance tests. Just as it is now routine to make an assertion that a particular gene product has a particular function, one can also make an assertion that a particular genotype displays a particular phenotype. The phenotype can be captured using an OMP term, and the evidence for determining the phenotype will be captured with an ECO term. For example, if a mutation causes normally motile cells to have a decreased ability to swim, one will capture this by linking the OMP term \u2018decreased motility\u2019 to an identifier for the mutant strain. The evidence for this annotation would be captured with an ECO term such as \u2018motility stab test evidence\u2019. Thus, researchers will be able to track which types of evidence were used to assess which phenotypes. It is important to note that phenotypes can also be predicted from whole-genome or transcriptome analysis of individual strains, and ECO is well suited to track these computational evidence types, just as it does for automated annotation of gene function. The application of ECO to capturing evidence associated with phenotypic study, and the resulting annotation of mutant phenotypes with these ECO terms, will facilitate studies in a broad area of applied research.

OBI is similar in content, and in some cases parallels ECO, in that it includes a classification of different types of instrument, protocols, analyses, materials and so on. However, it is formally orthogonal because ECO deals with evidence types, which are disjoint from the actual experiments performed. ECO classes are information artifacts, and most ECO evidence types can be defined as specified outputs of OBI \u2018planned process\u2019 and its subtypes, including \u2018assay\u2019 and \u2018data transformation\u2019. Since 2011, ECO has been working with OBI to leverage these attributes through two means. First, ECO can leverage existing instruments and methods described by OBI to facilitate rapid term development. For example, the ECO:0000224 term \u2018SOLiD sequencing evidence\u2019 can be created as an output of the OBI \u2018planned process\u2019 subclass \u2018SOLiD sequencing\u2019. This will allow an efficient division of responsibilities and avoid duplication of effort. Second, multiple instruments and methods, whose use culminate in complex evidence types, could be modeled in OBI as multiple ontology terms with numerous relationships, along with a simpler summary-type class. This OBI term could be imported by ECO, i.e. connected to a new ECO term via a bona fide relationship.
