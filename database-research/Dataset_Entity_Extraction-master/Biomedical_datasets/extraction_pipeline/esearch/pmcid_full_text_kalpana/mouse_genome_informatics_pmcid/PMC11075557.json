MGI serves as the central community resource of integrated information about mouse genome features, variation, expression, gene function, phenotype, and human disease models acquired from peer-reviewed publications, author submissions, and major bioinformatics resources. To facilitate integration and standardization of data, biocuration scientists annotate using terms from controlled metadata vocabularies and biological ontologies (e.g. Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, Mouse Developmental Anatomy, Disease Ontology, Gene Ontology, etc.), and by applying international community standards for gene, allele, and mouse strain nomenclature. MGI serves basic scientists, translational researchers, and data scientists by providing access to FAIR-compliant data in both human-readable and compute-ready formats.

It is composed of several interrelated resources, the core being the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) and the Gene Expression Database (GXD). MGD curates and integrates information about mouse genes, genomics and gene functions; alleles and their phenotypes; mouse strains and interstrain variation; and mouse models of human disease. GXD curates and integrates expression data from different mouse strains and mutants, with a particular emphasis on endogenous gene expression during mouse development. Both MGD and GXD have been recognized as Global Core Biodata Resources, meeting the criteria of the Global Biodata Coalition for high scientific quality, value, and usage (https://globalbiodata.org/what-we-do/global-core-biodata-resources/). MGI is a founding member of the Alliance of Genome Resources (the Alliance), a confederated union of model organism databases (MODs) (https://www.alliancegenome.org/) and the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium (https://geneontology.org). Other resources hosted by and integrated with MGI are the Mouse Models of Human Cancer database (MMHCdb), the International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR), and the Recombinase (cre) Data Portal (https://www.informatics.jax.org/home/recombinase). Together with these affiliated resources, MGI aims to advance our understanding of human health and disease using the mouse as a model system. Here, we provide an update of MGI and highlight some new developments, with a focus on MGD and GXD.

MGI specializes in the development and application of data and metadata standards, which are central to our integration process, assure comprehensive database queries, and contribute to MGI's compliance to FAIR principles. MGI uses these standards to annotate and integrate data from the literature, from data loads and from electronic submissions, such that these annotations are reliably searchable. Data standardization methods include incorporating biological ontologies as the framework for annotations and queries; extensive use of controlled vocabularies to systematize source metadata; establishing nomenclature standards throughout MGI; and issuing accession IDs that remain stable through nomenclature transitions.

Corresponding PAR features on X and Y chromosomes are homologous alleles (as at any autosomal locus), however, representing PARX/PARY homologs as alleles in MGI presents a challenge to our integrated search paradigm. Searching by genome location throughout the MGI interface is based on the locations of genes and genome features (chromosome + genome coordinates or map position). MGI does not provide coordinate-based searches at the allele level. In addition, the MGI schema allows for only a single set of genome coordinates per genome feature, which is a problem for the one gene/two coordinates model required to accommodate X and Y chromosome alleles for a PAR gene. Furthermore, gene-level annotations such as GO terms are not directly associated with alleles in MGI, which complicates the search for and display of PARX- or PARY-specific data in a PAR allele model. Therefore, to open PARX and PARY components to the full range of MGI's integrated queries, we opted to represent PARX and PARY components as separate genome features, distinctly named and accessioned, and with either X chromosome or Y chromosome coordinates, respectively. MGI's representation of PAR features differs from that of NCBI's, which uses the single gene/multiple coordinates model.

By contrast, strain-specific genome features in MGI represent the alleles of a canonical genome feature found in specific mouse strains. MGI has integrated the annotated genome features from 17 fully sequenced mouse strains in addition to the reference C57BL/6J strain, and these annotations can be found for any given genome feature in the Strain Comparison section of the gene detail page (Supplementary Fig. 4). Coordinates for the C57BL/6J strain gene model in the strain comparison table can differ slightly from the coordinates for the canonical gene, since the C57BL/6J strain gene model is derived from the outermost boundary coordinates of the union of gene model annotations from Ensembl and NCBI for that gene.

Over 600 thousand genome features in MGI have SNP associations. SNP associations for each genome feature can be viewed from the Strain Comparison section on feature detail pages.

The form's strain comparison devices can help narrow the connections between strain phenotypes and causative variant candidates. Users can search for SNPs associated with specific genes (Search by Gene mode, the default) (Fig. 7c) or for SNPs within either a defined region of the genome or within a marker range (Search by Region mode) (not shown). An example of how the SNP Query Form can be used to find SNPs associated with specific phenotypes is shown for a coat color phenotype in Fig. 7. The mouse tyrosinase gene (Tyr) encodes a monophenol oxidase (EC 1.14.18.1) that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in melanin production. Mice with mutations in the Tyr gene have hypopigmentation phenotypes including albinism (reviewed in). Several inbred mouse strains carry mutations in the Tyr gene and have white coat color phenotypes. The Strains and Strain Comparisons section of the SNP Query Form allows specification of one or more Reference strains (R) and Comparison strains (C), and provides two options to widen or concentrate the search, depending on annotation completeness among Reference or Comparison strains (allowing SNPs with no allele calls in some strains, see Fig. 7c). The designation of Reference and Comparison strains is how phenotypes are connected to SNP searches, as these strain groups serve as proxies for the phenotypes being contrasted. By choosing the Reference and Comparison stain sets according to shared phenotypes (Fig. 7c and d), the search can return SNPs that have contrasting allele calls (genotypes) between the strain groups. This is accomplished using an Allele Agreement filter option that restricts results to SNPs that have the same allele call in all Reference strains, and different calls in all comparison strains (Fig. 7e). Applying the Allele Agreement filter option in this example reduces the SNPs returned to 10, one of which (rs31191169) has been linked to the albinism phenotype of the Tyrc allele (Fig. 7f). The Tyr gene is associated with 668 SNPs in MGI.

It covers all relevant articles published from 1993 to the present, and all articles published in major developmental journals from 1990 to the present. As of 2023 November 27, the Gene Expression Literature Index contains 272,537 entries covering 32,842 references and containing expression information for 16,951 genes. Thirty-four percent of the reported assays are RNA in situ hybridization experiments, followed by Immunohistochemistry (31%) and RT-PCR assays (23%), reflecting the spatial resolution and sensitivity required for developmental expression studies. All literature index information is readily searchable via the Gene Expression Literature Search (https://www.informatics.jax.org/gxdlit). This search form is a highly effective tool to rapidly find publications with specific types of expression information. It is more effective and complete than PubMed searches because the index uses standard nomenclature for genes, assay types, and ages, and because the annotations are based on the entire article, including Supplementary Material.

Consortia and project-specific databases from which we have integrated large-scale in situ data include GenePaint, Eurexpress, BGEM, GUDMAP, and the IMPC. We bring all these data into standardized formats and integrate them with other information in GXD and MGI. The annotation work makes extensive use of controlled vocabularies and ontologies. A detailed entry is shown in Fig. 10. As of 2023 November 27, GXD contains detailed and standardized annotations for 133,635 expression assays that provide 1,968,735 expression results for 15,944 genes. Expression records are linked to digitized images of the original expression data. Currently, GXD includes 466,814 images. All these images are accessible via many different queries (see below) due to the standardized metadata that our annotations provide. A large proportion of the data are from RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments, many of which include data from mutant mice, illustrating the biological complexity of the expression data captured by GXD. At present, GXD holds expression data from 7,849 different mutants. See Table 6 for additional information on GXD's current data content. GXD uses the Mouse Developmental Anatomy (EMAPA) Ontology to annotate the time and space of gene expression. Initially developed in collaboration with the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP), GXD continues to maintain and extend this ontology. It currently includes over 34,000 stage-specific anatomy terms. However, because it is unfeasible to extend this representation down to the cellular level due to the large number of required hierarchical levels and leaf nodes, we recently began to include the Cell Ontology (CL) as an additional standardized descriptor of expression patterns. As illustrated in Fig. 10, publications or electronic submissions reporting expression in a particular cell type and tissue are now annotated in a modular fashion by using terms from the anatomy and cell ontology.

Because ArrayExpress used to import RNA-Seq and microarray experiments from GEO, we initially identified all RNA-Seq and microarray experiments in ArrayExpress that were within GXD's scope; annotated the metadata for GXD-relevant datasets by attributes of the samples used (e.g. strain, tissue, age, sex, mutation carried) as well as by experimental categories (baseline tissue comparison, wild-type vs mutant, etc.); and created a standardized, searchable index of RNA-Seq expression and microarray experiments in ArrayExpress and GEO to help researchers quickly and reliably find datasets of interest. Because ArrayExpress stopped incorporating datasets from GEO, we implemented an additional pipeline for importing and annotating data directly from GEO; and we began to identify and curate GXD-relevant datasets in GEO that are not available in ArrayExpress. We also added cell type as an additional standardized descriptor for indexing RNA-Seq and microarray experiments in GEO and ArrayExpress.

These files are also supplemented in the tool with additional matches generated by MGI by making lexical matches between term labels and synonyms. The MGI lexical matches for nonexact synonyms use the synonym types to determine the match type. Match types are not limited to only exact matches but also use close, broad, narrow, and related match types to increase the pool of potential terms for the user to add to the search.

The BLAT pipeline selects all high-quality sequences associated with participating features and automates BLAT alignments against the current reference mouse genome assembly using MGI's dedicated BLAT server. Genome coordinates are assigned to the feature from the longest high-quality alignment. All genome feature coordinates derived from the MGI BLAT pipeline are reviewed and approved by MGI curators, and the coordinate provider listed for these coordinates is MGI. For most feature types in MGI, genome coordinates are derived either from gene model sequences or from sequences used in BLAT alignments.

For genes and pseudogenes, we obtained Build 39 coordinates from updated NCBI and Ensembl gene models or by BLAT-aligning literature-curated GenBank sequences to the Build 39 assembly. Then, seeded with MGI gene-to-sequence ID associations from our Build38 mgi.gff3 file (with updated Build 39 coordinates for those sequence IDs), we ran our gene unification process, which computes genome coordinate overlaps and generates distinct gene-to-sequence ID unions for each gene and pseudogene. This process was simplified because gene-to-sequence ID associations change very little between mouse annotation builds (from NCBI and Ensembl) resulting in relatively few cases of novel or obsolete genes (which were curated separately and then incorporated into the next round of gene unification). For other genome features with Build 38 coordinates (transcription start sites, CpG Islands, transgene insertions, QTL, STS markers, etc.), we used NCBI's Remap resource to convert Build 38 coordinates to Build 39.
