Depending on the tumor site, cancer cells have increased or decreased expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 or 2 (EAAT1/2, SLC1A3/2) to regulate glutamate uptake for the benefit of tumor growth. Thus, EAAT1/2 may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in oncology. Genetic variation of EAAT1 has been associated with rare cases of episodic ataxia, but the occurrence and functional contribution of EAAT1 mutants in other diseases, such as cancer, is poorly understood. Here, 105 unique somatic EAAT1 mutations were identified in cancer patients from the Genomic Data Commons dataset. Using EAAT1 crystal structures and in silico studies, eight mutations were selected based on their close proximity to the orthosteric or allosteric ligand binding sites and the predicted change in ligand binding affinity. In vitro functional assessment in a live-cell, impedance-based phenotypic assay demonstrated that these mutants differentially affect L-glutamate and L-aspartate transport, as well as the inhibitory potency of an orthosteric (TFB-TBOA) and allosteric (UCPH-101) inhibitor. Moreover, two episodic ataxia-related mutants displayed functional responses that were in line with literature, which confirmed the validity of our assay. Of note, ataxia-related mutant M128R displayed inhibitor-induced functional responses never described before. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to gain mechanistic insights into the observed functional effects. Taken together, the results in this work demonstrate 1) the suitability of the label-free phenotypic method to assess functional variation of EAAT1 mutants and 2) the opportunity and challenges of using in silico techniques to rationalize the in vitro phenotype of disease-relevant mutants.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2016, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1 Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2031, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Glutamate is an abundant endogenous amino acid that acts as the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and serves as a key metabolite in energy homeostasis. In the synaptic cleft glutamate is transported across the cell membrane via excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), which belong to subfamily 1 of the solute carrier (SLC) transporters. Glutamate transport is thermodynamically coupled to the transport of three Na+ ions and one proton, and the counter-transport of one K+ ion, where binding of Na+ and/or substrate activates an uncoupled Cl\u2212 conductive state. Deregulated glutamate levels have been associated with a plethora of neurological diseases and more recently with cancer. As a result, pharmacological modulation of EAATs may be a promising therapeutic strategy for conditions that are associated with altered glutamate levels (A. A.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2914, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Depending on the location of the tumor, cancerous cells have been shown to exploit the uptake, metabolism and signaling properties of glutamate as well as aspartate as fuel for tumor proliferation and expansion. Healthy glia cells abundantly express EAAT1 and EAAT2 to mediate the majority of glutamate clearance. However, expression levels of EAAT2 are vastly reduced in gliomas, which combined with increased efflux via the glutamate/cystine antiporter (xCT, SLC7A11) leads to elevated glutamate levels surrounding the glioma that induce cell death and allow further growth of the tumor. Moreover, EAAT1 was found to be overexpressed and cause glutamate efflux in aggressive glioblastomas, which indicates selective EAAT1 inhibitors as a potential treatment option for glioma. In several instances of cancer in peripheral tissues EAAT1 expression has been linked to a poor disease prognosis. Under hypoxia or conditions that starve the tumor of glutamine, some cancer cells promote EAAT1 or EAAT2 expression to drive uptake of aspartate or glutamate which rescues cancer cell growth. As such, EAAT expression in such tumors could be a predictive biomarker and pharmacological modulation of glutamate transporter expression or activity could be of therapeutic interest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4185, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite the clear advantages for tumor cells to regulate EAAT expression, little is known about human genetic variations of these transporters in cancer, although several mutations have been associated with other diseases.

These mutants vary in their degree of loss- or gain-of-function of substrate transport and/or anion conductivity. Moreover, several other EAAT1 mutations and duplications have been associated with other neurological disorders including migraine, ADHD, autism, and Tourette\u2019s syndrome.

Glutamate transporters assemble in obligate homo-trimers of which the protomers operate independently of each other. Each protomer consists of a rigid trimerization or scaffold domain (scaD) and a dynamic transport domain (tranD) that engages with the substrate and co-transported Na+ ions. Structures covering inward-facing, intermediate, and outward-facing conformations provide information on the movement of individual transmembrane helices (TMs). Specifically, the flexible helical hairpin 2 (HP2) in tranD controls the access of ligands to the substrate binding site and is an essential \u2018gate\u2019 that upon opening and closing regulates the \u2018elevator-like\u2019 translocation of tranD. Of note, these transport mechanisms have been elucidated in part thanks to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations.

In addition to forming Na3, Y127 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonitrile group of UCPH-101. The docking studies suggest that this bond cannot form in Y127C (Figure 6F).

Although our computational studies did not shed any light into the potential mechanism of the observed behavior (Figure 5C, Supplementary Figures S9C, K), a recent study demonstrated that mutation of M128 to Arg may inflict two potential disruptions to EAAT1. The positively charged Arg could flip towards the \u2018inside\u2019 of the protein and disrupt the binding of Na+ to Na3. Occupation of this site by Na+ is crucial to initiate substrate binding and translocation, which may explain the absence of glutamate transport in M128R. In our simulations, however, a tighter coordination in Na3 was observed. Secondly, the Arg in M128R could flip \u2018outward\u2019 towards the lipid bilayer. Other MD studies revealed a local membrane deformation, which recruited a density of water molecules halfway into the bilayer. This may provide a pathway for Na+ ions that enter the Na3 site to leak into the cytosol, which could result in cell volume increase and subsequent morphological changes. Thus, we hypothesize that binding of TFB-TBOA or UCPH-101 to EAAT1 M128R stabilizes an Arg \u2018outward\u2019 conformation that allows uncoupled Na+ influx, which results in a phenotypic response in the absence of substrate (Supplementary Figures S5, S6).
