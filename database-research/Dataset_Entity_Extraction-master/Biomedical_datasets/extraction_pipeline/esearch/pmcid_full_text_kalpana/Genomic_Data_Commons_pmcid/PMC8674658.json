In general, even if the primary tumor is removed, 25% of the patients will develop distant metastasis. The ability to precisely predict the outcome on the basis of every patient\u2019s clinical information, pathological and molecular features have attracted growing attention especially in the era of precision tumor treatment. A number of reports in literature have predicted the survival status of STS patients. However, nomograms in these studies were all limited to be based on the clinical features that can only be determined after surgery; in consequence, their clinical applications might be restricted. The ideal nomograms should also include biomarkers, molecular signatures, and genomic expression to help predict survival status more accurately. With the rapid development of bioinformatics tools, multiple biomarkers for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction have been identified.

Chen et al. found that AURKA directly promoted the Warburg effect by phosphorylating lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), thereby promoting tumor growth. It has also been confirmed that the expression level of LHX9 was significantly up-regulated in osteosarcoma, and inhibiting LHX9 reduced the ability of cell growth and invasion. Li et al. proved that the levels of IGF-1 and IGF-1R in osteosarcoma were elevated, and their overexpression promoted the invasion and resistance of osteosarcoma cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21956, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, with the development of bioinformatics tools, multiple glycolysis-related gene models have been developed to assess the survival status of cancer patients.
