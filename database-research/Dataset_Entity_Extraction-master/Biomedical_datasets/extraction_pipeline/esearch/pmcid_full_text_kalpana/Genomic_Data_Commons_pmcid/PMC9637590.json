A multi-omics study of HCC by Come Hall Z\u2019s team confirmed that specific lipid metabolic pathways are coherently altered when hepatocytes switch to proliferation. Aerobic glycolysis acts as a hallmark of hepatocellular carcinoma metabolism and regulates the progression of HCC, such as the PI3K/Akt pathway, AMPK and HIF-1\u03b1. By modulating epidermal growth factor (EGFR) activation, SPP1 can influence the immune escape and malignant biological activity of tumor cells, and its overexpression enhances HCC development and metastasis. BIRC5, also known as survivin, is the most effective inhibitor of apoptosis, and its high expression in HCC cells promotes proliferation. The prognosis of HCC patients with high STC2 expression is poor, and STC2 can promote the formation of local blood vessels, tumor proliferation, and metastasis. Although the predictive value of GLP1R and RAET1E in HCC patients has not been reported, they can be used as potential biomarkers. In the verification set, the 5-IRG signature demonstrated strong predictability and repeatability. Our prediction model has a high level of resilience compared to those of other studies, and the AUC exhibits excellent discrimination.

Among the 22 types of immune cells, Tregs, macrophages M0, dendritic cells, memory CD4 + T cells, and follicular helper cells were more abundant in high-risk patients. It has been reported that tumor-associated neutrophils in HCC can recruit macrophages and Treg cells into the TIME to form an immunosuppressive microenvironment.In summary, we postulate that the expression pattern of IRGs influences the degree of immune cell infiltration in HCC, hence reducing the antitumor immune response. However, we acknowledge that further experimental verification is required. Immune checkpoints are inhibitory pathways in the immune system, and some immune checkpoint molecules are targets of immunotherapy. Overexpression of the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in HCC inhibits the proliferation and activation of T cells, and blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can enhance immune normalization and the antitumor response.
