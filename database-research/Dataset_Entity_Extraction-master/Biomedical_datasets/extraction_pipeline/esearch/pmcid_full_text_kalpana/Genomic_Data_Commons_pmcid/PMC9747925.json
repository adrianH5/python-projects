We explored cancer-related mutation patterns in all GPCR classes combined and individually.

This method was chosen primarily to evaluate residue conservation across GPCRs and within GPCR subfamilies. Secondarily, we tried to leverage its ability to define residue functional characterization. Of note, we performed this analysis not only for Class A GPCRs but for all classes defined in GPCRdb; together and independently. Key to the TEA approach is that for each alignment position the Shannon entropy, which measures the level of conservation of amino acid residues at a certain position in a multiple sequence alignment, is calculated both within a GPCR subfamily and within all GPCRs. Therefore, the combination of these can provide a measure for the position function. Multiple interesting groups were identified, such as residues relevant for receptor function/activation (type Q3). Type Q3 are positions with a low Shannon entropy both within GPCR subfamilies and for the entire GPCR superfamily, this high conservation is linked to involvement in GPCR-conserved working mechanisms. Separating the graph into quadrants (Q1\u20134), type Q3 residues are represented in the bottom left quadrant in Fig.\u00a01. A second group are residues relevant for ligand recognition (type Q2), made up by residues that are conserved within subfamilies, but not within the GPCR superfamily. Hence, these are associated with ligand recognition that is specific and conserved within a given subfamily. Type Q2 residues, represented in the top left quadrant were less noticeable in the all-class TEA (Fig.\u00a01a), since inclusion of a larger number of subfamilies led to an increase in the overall entropy. However, it was more obvious in Classes A\u2013C (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013d). Finally, in the top right quadrant of the TEA plot a third group of residues, Q1, is represented that are conserved neither among all GPCRs nor GPCR subfamilies.

Residues with a high mutation frequency were defined as those above the 90th percentile in the distribution of mutation counts by position. Conversely, residues with a low mutation frequency were defined as those under the 10th percentile. Absolute mutation count was (anti)correlated with entropy (Fig.\u00a01). We observed a trend where more conserved type Q3 residues (bottom left quadrant, low entropy) had a higher mutation rate in cancer compared to the less conserved Q1 residues (top right quadrant, high entropy). We illustrated this with the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD entropy overall and across families (Fig.\u00a01 and Supplementary Table S1). In the all-class TEA (Fig.\u00a01a), the low mutation range had mean entropy values of 0.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38 and 0.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27 (Shannon and Average entropy across families, respectively). The high mutation range had lower mean entropy values of 0.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10 and 0.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13, respectively. On the contrary, this trend was not observed on natural variance data from the 1000 Genomes dataset (Supplementary Fig. S2). There, mean entropy values for the low mutation range were 0.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30 and 0.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23, respectively; and 0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 and 0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12, respectively, for the high mutation range. We observed an average downward shift in entropy values for highly mutated positions per subfamily (not in the overall Shannon entropy) and an upward shift for less frequently mutated positions. Combined this showed a pressure in the GDC data for mutations in subfamily-conserved positions at the expense of mutations in non-conserved positions. This trend was maintained across classes, although less marked for for Classes B and C, and supported by the fact that from the type Q3 residues highlighted in Fig.\u00a01a, higher mutation frequencies were associated with the most conserved positions in TM domains 3, 4, and 7 (i.e. 3\u2009\u00d7\u200950, 4\u2009\u00d7\u200950, and 7\u2009\u00d7\u200950).

The high amount of mutations in residues of these and other motifs was investigated further in section \u201cMutation patterns within functionally conserved motifs\u201d.

This included a cluster of six residues in ECL2 found within the GDC dataset, from which four positions were previously shown to influence chemokine binding when mutated to Ala. In the G protein binding site, the Class A highly conserved R126. was found to be mutated. This position is in the \u201cDRY\u201d motif and it is the most frequently mutated position in the GDC set, resulting in altered G protein coupling to the receptor in for instance the adenosine receptor family. Some experimental evidence is available for CCR5 as well, where mutation to Asn abolished G protein signaling. In the orthosteric site, four amino acids were previously investigated by a site-directed mutagenesis study by Garcia-Perez et al., Y1875.31, I1985.42, N2586.58, and E2837.39 with variable effects. Mutating residue E2837.39, to Ala or to the more conservative Gln, had the biggest effect on maraviroc affinity decrease. The structural effect of I1985.42 and E2837.39 mutations in maraviroc binding can be derived from the crystal structure of CCR5 with this negative allosteric modulator (Fig.\u00a06c). Mutations on these two positions had an important effect on the ligand binding of two other HIV-1 drugs\u2014vicriviroc and aplaviroc\u2014and clinical candidates\u2014TAK-779 and TAK-220\u2014in two studies. Whilst E2837.39A abolishes maraviroc binding, chemokine CCL5 binding is mildly (20-fold) affected. On the contrary, Y1875.31A showed almost no effect on the binding affinity of maraviroc, while affecting chemokine recognition. These observations exemplify the relevance of our method to prioritize cancer-related mutations in site-mutagenesis studies, and link them to receptor activation, endogenous ligand recognition, and the recognition of small (drug-like) molecules.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36170, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While completing this manuscript the TCGA dataset was used to identify significantly mutated GPCRs in cancer in a complementary extensive study by Wu et al..

Moreover, we included the availability of chemical tools to study the selected GPCRs, as exemplified by our QSAR models. Another recent study by Huh et al. focused on Class A GPCRs expressed in tumors reaching similar conclusions regarding Class A-specific functional motifs. There a similar method was used to calculate mutation enrichment from natural variance which predicted the impact of mutations in specific sequence positions. Their results were validated in vitro, confirming the parallel effect of Class A GPCR mutations in receptor signaling. Our results extend to all GPCR class-specific functional motifs, opening novel paths to GPCR cancer research. Recently, we have published analyses of two other GPCRs, the Adenosine A1 and A2B receptors, for which cancer-related somatic mutations were identified similar to the analysis as presented here.
