Growing evidence indicates that the key mechanism of interaction between the immune system and LGG is the immune checkpoints in the dynamic effect of immunity.

In our study, PPI network was constructed using SRING tool and Cytoscape software. Finally, 25 TME-related hub genes were selected and the potential pathways such as immune response, inflammatory response, plasma membrane and receptor activity were identified.

After binding to its receptors, namely CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, CCL5 induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and other signaling pathways involved in the regulation of various cellular functions, such as the proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Interestingly, it has been reported that the CCL5/CCR1 axis is critical for maintaining mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) identity and multipotency. Non-neoplastic cell-derived signals (chemokines and cytokines) in the TME may also represent viable treatment targets. It was reported that CCL5 was responsible for maintaining neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mouse optic glioma growth in vivo. Since malignant gliomas may achieve partial independence from growth regulatory factors produced by non-neoplastic cells in the TME by producing the same cytokines secreted by the stromal cells in their low-grade counterparts, the NF1 protein, neurofibromin, negatively regulates CCL5 expression through suppression of AKT/mTOR signaling. Besides, CCL5 operates through an unconventional CCL5 receptor, CD44, to inhibit mouse mesenchymal glioblastoma (M-GBM) cell apoptosis. Collectively, these findings reveal that paracrine factors important for LGG growth can be usurped by high-grade tumors to create autocrine regulatory circuits that maintain malignant glioma survival.

CXCR3 is mainly expressed by various effector T lymphocytes including CD4+ Th1 cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. The principle chemokine ligands of CXCR3 are CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. Maru et al. first reported that CXCR3 and CXCL10 were increased in glioma cells compared with adult human astrocytes. Moreover, they found that the expression level of CXCR3 correlated with malignancy grade of glioma. Liu et al. examined the role of CXCR3 in glioblastoma (GBM) progression using the GL261 murine model of malignant glioma. They found that Murine glioma GL261 cells express CXCL10 in vitro and GL261 tumors express CXCL9 and CXCL10 in vivo. CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice with glioma had significantly shorter median survival time and reduced numbers of tumor-infiltrated natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells in contrast with WT glioma mice. Moreover, both CXCR3 and its ligands are expressed by murine and human glioma cell lines (A172, T98G, U87, U118 and U138). These results suggested that CXCR3 system may be a unique target for human glioma therapy. Recently, Pu et al. investigated the potential prognostic value of CXCR3 in primary GBM and its relationship with clinicopathological features. Using K-M survival curve analysis with a log-rank comparison of the 65 primary glioma patients, they found that the patients with higher expression levels of CXCR3 had shorter progression free survival and overall survival compared with those with lower expression levels of CXCR3. Using univariate Cox regression analysis, they found that high CXCR3 expression was a risk factor for primary GBM [P<0.01, hazard ratio (HR) 2.336; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.341\u20134.071]. Furthermore, their multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that CXCR3 expression level was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of primary glioma patients.
