It is found on the human chromosome number 7 and regulates the diverse cellular mechanisms of the human body. The impact of mutations occurring in the MET gene is demonstrated by their detrimental effects on normal cellular functions. These mutations can change the structure and function of MET leading to different diseases such as lung cancer, neck cancer, colorectal cancer, and many other complex syndromes. Hence, the current study focused on finding deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and their subsequent impact on the protein's structure and functions, which may contribute to the emergence of cancers. These nsSNPs were first identified utilizing computational tools like SIFT, PROVEAN, PANTHER-PSEP, PolyPhen-2, I-Mutant 2.0, and MUpro. A total of 45359 SNPs of MET gene were accumulated from the database of dbSNP, and among them, 1306 SNPs were identified as non-synonymous or missense variants. Out of all 1306 nsSNPs, 18 were found to be the most deleterious. Moreover, these nsSNPs exhibited substantial effects on structure, binding affinity with ligand, phylogenetic conservation, secondary structure, and post-translational modification sites of MET, which were evaluated using MutPred2, RaptorX, ConSurf, PSIPRED, and MusiteDeep, respectively. Also, these deleterious nsSNPs were accompanied by changes in properties of MET like residue charge, size, and hydrophobicity. These findings along with the docking results are indicating the potency of the identified SNPs to alter the structure and function of the protein, which may lead to the development of cancers.

Hence, it is feasible that the HGF or SF binding site is confined within this protein sequence. Within the longest structures, the strongest binding affinity was detected, but the binding affinity of 25\u2013519 residues and 25\u2013567 residues was easily assessable. On the other hand, 567\u2013932 exhibited no binding affinity. As a result, the N-terminal portion of the MET ectodomain (25\u2013519) is adequate for binding with HGF or SF, while the C-terminal part (567\u2013932) has no binding affinity, but stimulates the binding affinity to the N-terminal portion (25\u2013519). Therefore, after the structural analysis, six variants (L238S, A320V, P239R, A364T, D340G, and T222M) among 18 deleterious variants of MET protein were selected for homology modeling through PyMOL software, because MET protein has shown strong binding affinity between 25\u2013519 residues. The modeled mutant variants then went through molecular docking via PatchDock and FireDock servers for analyzing the binding affinity of native and mutant complexes. The mutant complex A364T-NK1 with 6.31 binding energy showed the least binding interaction than native and other mutant complexes. This assessment showed that the mutant complexes can show the least binding interactions than native complexes on the basis of their deleterious effect. On the other hand, similar in silico analysis of the HGF gene revealed that five nsSNPs (D358G, G648R, I550N, N175S, and R220Q) of the HGF are the most deleterious that hinder MET\u2013HGF interaction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48676, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The gene\u2013gene interactions analyzed by GeneMANIA server showed the networking of MET with other related genes, whereas the protein\u2013protein interactions by STRING database revealed connections of MET with other proteins.

However, the result of Kaplan\u2013Meier Plot investigation specified that the MET gene deregulation can be regarded as a substantial diagnostic way in prognostic tool for identifying lung and gastric cancers patients because the plot showed less survival rate for them. This also revealed that the sex or gender-specific cancer's (such as ovarian and breast cancers that are common among females) survival percentage is not influenced by the deregulation of the MET gene. Considering that the deleterious nsSNPs of MET have a major influence on the structure and function of MET protein, they can affect the normal cellular functions in MET dysregulation. Among the identified 18 deleterious nsSNPs, most nsSNPs have no existing literature. Only 5 (H1094R, H1094Y, D1228N, Y1230H, and L1195V) of 18 deleterious nsSNPs have been found associated with resistance mechanisms to MET kinase inhibitors, which ultimately affects cancer treatments.

However, none of these predicted deleterious nsSNPs were found to be well studied in the broad spectrum. All the computational tools have shown us simply the predicted results. Yet, the sophistication of these algorithms solely depends on raw experimental data. The downstream structural and functional analysis may be faulty as a result of unreliable and inaccurate raw data. Hence, it is advised to employ a number of tools and come to a decision by comparing the outcomes of these tools.

Eighteen most deleterious nsSNPs were detected in MET among 45359 SNPs for further practical field application in research intent. The effects on binding affinity also imply that mutation prompts changes in wild type proteins. The altered structure and function of MET protein can lead to dysregulated activities of the MET gene, which was further supported by the docking results that may induce complex diseases.
