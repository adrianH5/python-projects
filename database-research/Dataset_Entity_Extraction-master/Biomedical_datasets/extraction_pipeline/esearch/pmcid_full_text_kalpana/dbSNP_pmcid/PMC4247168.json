A comparison of two of the most prominent cancer genome sequencing databases from different institutes (CCLE and COSMIC) revealed marked discrepancies in the detection of missense mutations in identical cell lines (57.38% conformity). The main reason for this discrepancy is inadequate sequencing of GC-rich areas of the exome. We have therefore mapped over 400 regions of consistent inadequate sequencing (cold-spots) in known cancer-causing genes and kinases, in 368 of which neither institute finds mutations. We demonstrate, using a newly identified PAK4 mutation as proof of principle, that specific targeting and sequencing of these GC-rich cold-spot regions can lead to the identification of novel driver mutations in known tumor suppressors and oncogenes. We highlight that cross-referencing between genomic databases is required to comprehensively assess genomic alterations in commonly used cell lines and that there are still significant opportunities to identify novel drivers of tumorigenesis in poorly sequenced areas of the exome.

Similar to our larger scale comparison we observed low consensus between missense mutation detection in mutually sequenced genes (mean 41.33%; Supp. Figure 1). Analysing the raw read data from CCLE suggested that the most common source of discrepancy was poor sequencing read coverage (41%; Figure 2). We therefore analysed 10 randomly selected CCLE whole exome sequencing files to identify regions of poor coverage (\u2018cold-spots\u2019). We discovered over 400 cold-spots (100bp or larger) in Cancer Census and kinase genes that we have mapped as a resource for the research community (Figure 3 / Supp. Table 2). These cold-spots are rich in GC nucleotides (63.49% compared to 51.74% average GC-content of all exons in target genes) indicating that high GC-content is a major cause of inadequate sequencing coverage. Importantly, we found for CCLE and COSMIC data combined, a 18-fold reduction in mutation density at these loci relative to the remaining exonic regions in the dataset. Extrapolating these data suggests that an additional 1871 mutations would have been detected in Cancer Census and kinase genes across the 568 cell lines (corresponding to a mean of over 3 new mutations in Cancer Census or kinase genes per cell line) had the read coverage in the cold-spots been adequate. The TET2 cold-spot (Figure 3) is one of the largest of such loci identified, and is not associated with high GC-content. Mutations were reported for this locus in COSMIC, suggesting a sequencing issue specific to the CCLE protocol.

Our own sequencing identified 27 novel mutations in these 4 cell lines that were undocumented by COSMIC or CCLE (Supp. Table 3). Two thirds of these were located in areas of poor read coverage as defined by the CCLE hybrid capture sequencing (less than 4 reads) but reasonable coverage in our data (mean read depth = 63). The average GC-content 100 bp either side of these newly identified mutations was significantly higher than those where all three institutes were in agreement (60.85% vs. 47.13%: P = < 10\u22124). These findings suggest that the new mutations were previously missed due to being located in GC-rich cold-spots. Whilst the contribution of factors such as different library preparation and reagents may play a role, our data indicate that NGS efficiency of high GC-rich regions is improving, but earlier datasets are more likely to have missed mutations in GC-rich regions. The majority of The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium data is of a similar age to CCLE and COSMIC, and therefore subject to similar limitations. Our own more recent sequencing faired better in these regions but still had many GC-rich cold-spots in cancer associated genes.

Given the importance of the PAK kinases in cancer proliferation and survival pathways, we further characterised this mutation. Overexpression of the PAK4 E119Q mutant in 293T cells showed enhanced activation of the ERK pathway compared to the wild type kinase, suggesting this is a gain-of-function mutation (Supp. Figure 3).

Conformity increased to 67.85% although 10,091 COSMIC only mutations remained unmatched to CCLE (Supp. Figure 4).

Although a relatively minor factor in our comparisons, the effect of gaining a mutation in a cell line has the potential to greatly affect pharmacogenomic studies. This is highlighted by eight cell lines in the larger comparison that contained activating codon 61 NRAS mutations that were reported in only one of the databases (7 reported by COSMIC alone; 1 by CCLE alone). Analysis of the sequencing data covering the 7 NRAS mutations not detected by CCLE confirmed good read coverage (mean 220 reads) without evidence of mutation in all 7 cases, suggesting loss or gain of the mutation by cell passaging.

Comparing only 64 genes, this study found some acceptable discrepancies in mutational profiles of cells reported by CCLE and COSMIC but concluded that they were due to differences in the sequencing platforms and variant filtering. Our analysis of a larger panel of genes shows that there is marked discrepancy in sequencing results caused by inadequate sequencing and acquisition of new mutations in addition to variances in dbSNP calling. The authors also concluded that mutational profile was not a major cause of discrepancy in pharmacogenomics data based on the finding that mutational status was not significantly associated with drug response. However our data show that mutations of cancer causing genes in sequencing read cold-spots will be frequently undetected, and therefore greatly weaken any analysis attempting to correlate mutation status with drug response.
