Typically, drug resistance occurs due to amino acid substitutions (AAS) in drug target proteins. The study aimed at developing and validating a new approach to the creation of structure-property relationships (SPR) classification models to predict AASs leading to drug resistance to inhibitors of tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1. The approach was based on the representation of AASs as peptides described in terms of structural formulas. The data on drug-resistant and non-resistant variants of AAS for two isoforms of ABL1 were extracted from the COSMIC database. The given training sets (approximately 700 missense variants) were used for the creation of SPR models in MultiPASS software based on substructural atom-centric multiple neighborhoods of atom (MNA) descriptors for the description of the structural formula of protein fragments and a Bayesian-like algorithm for revealing structure-property relationships. It was found that MNA descriptors of the 6th level and peptides from 11 amino acid residues were the best combination for ABL1 isoform 1 with the prediction accuracy (AUC) of resistance to imatinib (0.897) and dasatinib (0.996). For ABL1 isoform 2 (resistance to imatinib), the best combination was MNA descriptors of the 6th level, peptides form 15 amino acids (AUC value was 0.909). The prediction of possible drug-resistant AASs was made for dbSNP and gnomAD data. The six selected most probable imatinib-resistant AASs were additionally validated by molecular modeling and docking, which confirmed the possibility of resistance for the E334V and T392I variants.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1827, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

This phenomenon was first considered when bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics was discovered. However, later, it was found that similar mechanisms occur in other cases, oncological disease being among them. Although many types of cancer are initially responsive to chemotherapy, drug resistance can be developed over time due to various mechanisms, such as DNA mutations and metabolic changes that promote drug inhibition and degradation. There are many different mechanisms of drug resistance, but most of them are often related to genetic variations leading to the single amino acid substitution (AAS) in drug target proteins. The early discovery of such an AAS is needed to improve the treatment of patients by changing the drug.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3074, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are various bioinformatics methods for predicting variants associated with drug resistance. All of them are divided into two large groups: methods based on the 3D structure of proteins and methods based on the analysis of protein sequences using machine learning methods. The first group includes molecular modeling, calculation of the structure-dependent binding energy, and a fitness model based on the volume of the binding site. These methods were widely used in the past but required high-quality specialists in structural bioinformatics and computational resources and were associated with studies of individual amino acid substitutions. In many cases, such studies were made to reveal the molecular mechanisms of known drug-resistant substitutions. Therefore, Lin and co-authors studied mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib and lorlatinib in ROS1 fusion-positive lung cancer by structural modeling and comparison of wild and mutated 3D structures of ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase). This study was limited by seven amino acid substitutions. They showed a severe steric clash against the binding of lorlatinib for the L2086F substitution in ROS1. Wu and co-authors used an ensemble of molecular modeling strategies to theoretically uncover the resistance mechanisms of V550E/L and N535D/K mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR4. They showed that drug resistance to these substitutions was related to weakening the binding affinity of ponatinib. The analysis of the molecular basis of drugs binding to wild-type/mutant ABL1 in 3D complexes is one of the main trends in the computational estimation of possible drug-resistant amino acid substitutions. The 3D structural basis of mutation hotspots (gatekeeper, G-loop, \u03b1C-helix, and A-loop) associated with 3318 drug-resistant mutations in 538 human kinases was discussed in the review of Kim with co-authors. Hauser and co-authors used docking and free-energy calculations to estimate the drug resistance of 144 AASs to eight FDA-approved drugs acting as ABL1 inhibitors. Liu and co-authors used the docking of drugs into the mutant ABL1 structure and the estimation of its binding free energy together with IC50 values to predict and experimentally validate 12 drug-resistant AASs related to imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. The second group includes methods for predicting drug-resistant variants using rules and classifiers obtained on the basis of a statistical analysis of sequences of resistant and nonresistant proteins. Some recent publications used a combination of structural modeling and machine learning methods. For example, Zhou and co-authors created models and the freely available web application SUSPECT-ABL to predict the drug resistance of AASs to eight FDA-approved drugs. They used machine learning based on the generation and evaluation of a set of features capturing structural, geometric, and physicochemical properties of the protein and ligands and changes in Gibbs free energy of protein-ligand binding affinity based on homology modeling of mutant proteins for 144 ABL1 mutations (19 resistant and 125 susceptible) and docking of the drugs. Aldeghi and co-authors evaluated the ability of three distinct computational methods (structure-based, mixed physics- and knowledge-based potentials, and machine learning) to predict the drug resistance of protein mutations in Abl kinase. Despite the fact that approaches to the creation of such methods were proposed more than 20 years ago, there are still no generally accepted methods, and many methods give conflicting results. The identification of new potential drug-resistant AAS remains complicated and is mostly carried out in scientific laboratories. Therefore, there is an urgent need to create new effective methods for predicting resistant variants associated with AAS in the sequence of target proteins.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6984, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here, we introduce a new method for predicting AASs leading to tumor drug resistance based on a combination of bioinformatics and chemoinformatics approaches.

BCR-ABL1 gene fusion leads to the synthesis of chimeric autoactivated proteins, inducing cell proliferation and resistance to programmed cell death. Imatinib, the first ABL1 inhibitor, was launched in 2001 and revolutionized CML treatment, significantly decreasing mortality and increasing survival in patients. CML is considered a chronic disease, and patients apply imatinib for a long time. It was shown that 17% of patients revealed drug resistance, and most patients with advanced-phase disease rapidly became resistant to therapy. The rapid appearance of drug resistance to imatinib in the second to third year of therapy may be related to the presence of clones with drug-resistant AASs at ABL1.

The values of TP (78), FP (102), and sensitivity (0.951) are the highest, and the values of TN (87), FN (4), and specificity (0.460) are the lowest by default threshold (Pa > Pi). It means that almost all imatinib resistant AASs in the set were predicted correctly, but more than half of the susceptible AASs were also predicted to be drug-resistant. At that point, the value of balance accuracy for MultiPASS (0.706) was significantly higher compared with that given by the results of SUSPECT-ABL (0.509). By increasing the Pa value as a threshold, we change the ratio of specificity and sensitivity values. Table 2 shows that Pa > 0.5 is the optimal threshold with the highest value of balance accuracy (0.822). Moreover, the majority of imatinib-resistant AASs were predicted correctly ((71/82) \u00d7 100 = 86.6%), and only ((42/189) \u00d7 100 = 22.2%) susceptible AASs were predicted as drug-resistant. Therefore, this threshold was used for the estimation of drug-resistant AASs from the gnomAD and dbSNP databases (see below).

Therefore, E334V and T392I variants can explain the reduction in the protein binding strength of imatinib and a decline in its pharmacotherapeutic effectiveness. At that point, it should be mentioned that both variants (E334V and T392I) are far from the binding site of imatinib, and they change the conformation of the protein in such a way that they disrupt the interaction with the inhibitor. On the other hand, T392I is in the A-loop (the activation loop including amino acid residues 381\u2013402) of ABL1, which is considered an important region for drug-resistant mutations related to imatinib.

Over the past decade, a significant amount of data related to genomic variants leading to AASs in tumors has been revealed and collected at the COSMIC database. Some of them are known to cause resistance against the appropriate drugs. The availability of such data provides bioinformaticians with the possibility of developing approaches to predict AASs related to drug resistance. Our study displays a successful combination of bioinformatics and chemoinformatics methods (sequence-structure analysis), leading to the creation of high-performance and accurate structure-property relationship classification models for the prediction of AASs related to individual resistance to antineoplastic drugs. As a practical application of these models, they have been applied to AASs in the ABL1 protein from the gnomAD and NCBI dbSNP databases to reveal new possible variants of drug resistance. As a result, using the created SPR model, six potential drug-resistant AASs have been predicted with a high probability. Based on molecular modeling and docking, two of them (E334V and T392I) have also been established as potential disruptors of protein-ligand interactions.

It has some advantages as it does not require high-resolution 3D structures of protein-ligand complexes that are not always available. Moreover, due to technical difficulties, only a part of the proteins in such 3D complexes is quite often obtained, and this does not allow the analysis of drug-resistant mutations along the entire length of the protein sequence. In our study, we wanted to demonstrate how well this approach works without involving additional characteristics or data related to protein features. At the same time, it is known that some drug-resistant AASs are located in the secondary structures of proteins, such as helices, loops, and strands, and may lead to disruption of their structure. For example, Kim and co-authors systematically investigated four types of representative mutation hotspots (gatekeeper, G-loop, \u03b1C-helix, and A-loop) associated with drug resistance in 538 human protein kinases. They described AASs E255K/V and Y257C in ABL1 as the representative G-loop mutations that disrupt an electrostatic triad required for imatinib-binding, causing cell resistance to imatinib. Zhang and co-authors used the analysis of AASs within the \u03b23-\u03b1C loop of EGFR/ERBB2/BRAF/MAP2K1 to predict responses to therapies. Zhou and co-authors also highlighted the importance of the AASs influence on the conformations of the ABL1 phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) and the activation loop (A-loop). Therefore, despite the fact that the peptides used in the creation of models can indirectly reflect the features of the secondary structure of the protein in the corresponding positions of AASs, the use of data on the secondary structure of the protein as well as other features of the protein (for example, a domain or an interdomain region, an active site or a center of allosteric regulation, etc.) in the sites of AASs as additional variables may improve the accuracy of predicting the relationship between AASs and drug resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34885, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the future, we plan to study the influence of additional above-mentioned features of proteins on the accuracy of SPR models.
