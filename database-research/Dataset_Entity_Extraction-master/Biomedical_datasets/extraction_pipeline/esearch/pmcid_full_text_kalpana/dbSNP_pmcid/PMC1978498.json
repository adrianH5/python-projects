Our data does not support the role of CHRM5 as a generalised risk factor for drug dependence. Instead our data suggest specific effects for tobacco and cannabis but not alcohol. One explanation for this phenomenon can be drawn from the proposed action of the nicotine, alcohol and cannabis within the mesolimbic system. In the mesolimbic system, both nicotine (the active-compound in tobacco) and delta9-tetrahyrocannabinol (delta9-THC) (the active-compound in cannabis) act predominantly through receptor-mediated pathways. Specifically, nicotine operates through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) complexes; delta9-THC operates through activation of the neural cannabinoid receptor, CB1R. As with M5R, the nAChR are co-expressed on dopamine neurones of the SNc and VTA. The CB1R are present in the VTA and are co-expressed with dopamine neurones of the nucleus accumbens. Interestingly, CB1R knockout mice show similar reduced reward and withdrawal to M5R knockout mice. Clearly, the role of nicotine and delta9-THC in dopaminergic neurotransmission is complex, with receptors also expressed on neurones that are afferent to the mesolimbic dopamine-containing neurones. However, the co-localisation and direct ligand action on dopaminergic neurones is common to nicotine and delta9-THC. Conversely, although ethanol administration stimulates neurones within the VTA, ethanol is thought to elicit its effect through a non-ligand interaction with receptor proteins on mesolimbic-afferent neurones containing GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. This mode of action, specifically the predominant role of ethanol in neurones afferent to the mesolimbic dopamine/M5R-containing neurones may in part explain the lack of association seen between CHRM5 and alcohol dependence and dose in this study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 16298, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to the role in substance dependence, CHRM5 may also be important in other psychiatric disorders where dysregulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission has been implicated. A recent study examined the role of CHRM5 in schizophrenia. The marker rs623941, located within intron 3, 2.3 kb 5' of exon 4, was not associated with schizophrenia. A second marker in the alpha7-cholinergic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA7) locus was not linked with schizophrenia. When examined together the authors reported linkage with schizophrenia. However, the CHRM5-CHRNA7 two-marker haplotype extends over 3 Mb of genomic DNA and is unlikely to describe an ancestral chromosome block. Consequently, the linkage of the CHRM5-CHRNA7 haplotype with schizophrenia is unlikely to represent evidence due to linkage disequilibrium with functional markers in either gene.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 17162, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 17173, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Animal models clearly show a role of the M5R in modulating dependence to drugs of addiction.

A single intact class was selected at random from each of these schools to constitute the wave one sample. At the second wave of data collection, six months later, a second intact class from each participating school was selected at random. A total of 44 schools were included in the study (24 Government, 11 Catholic and 9 Independent private schools). The first six waves of data collection were undertaken at 6-monthly intervals between 1992 and 1996. The last two survey waves were in 1998 and 2002.
