This has led to the question of how to systematically collect and curate the variation data. In addition, progress in sequencing technology has allowed mutational analysis of more than 10,000 genes in a single individual and has accelerated research on disease-associated allelic variations at the whole genome sequencing level. The human genome is estimated to have up to 200,000 amino acid-substituting variations in the protein-coding sequences (CVs), also called nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). While substituting CVs may contribute to phenotype differences among individuals such as hair color, skin color and disease susceptibility, certain CVs (generally missense mutations) are known to cause highly-penetrant, Mendelian-inherited pathological conditions. Missense mutations account for approximately half of all allelic variants underlying inherited human diseases. As a result, it is vital that we correlate and attribute specific phenotypes to certain CVs. Database searches and bioinformatic analyses are the primary tools for this purpose.

The distribution was similar in the HapMap dataset (52.1%, 46.9%, and 1.02% for nsSNPs, snSNPs, and trSNPs, respectively). Among the 23,045 CVM, missense mutations accounted for the largest proportion (17,970/23,045; 78.0%), followed by nonsense mutations (5006/23,045; 21.7%). In a very small proportion of CVM (69/23,045; 0.299%), a nucleotide substitution was expected to retain the original amino acid, instead of changing it to another amino acid or stop codon. Among the concurrent CVs (group [C]), amino acid-substituting (AA1>AA2) CVs were by far the most common (934/1005; 92.9%). Truncation variations accounted for 4.08% (41/1005), followed by variations expected to retain the original amino acid (30/1005; 2.99%). When CVH were taken into consideration, the proportion of amino acid-substituting CVs was almost unchanged (302/332; 91.0%). The proportion of the AA1>AA1 group (20/332; 6.02%) was higher than that of truncation variations (10/332; 3.01%). We observed that variations in three different categories in the concurrent CVs (group [C]) showed different distributions of SNP validation scores calculated from frequency information, submitter's validation and availability in HapMap (Validation status code is available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/database/organism_shared_data/SnpValidationCode.bcp.gz) (Figure S1). The average of trSNPs validation scores was the lowest at 1.27, followed by the nsSNPs at 2.03. The snSNPs average was the highest at 6.40. Among the 41 trSNPs, validation scores of 33 variations (80.5%) were less than 3, while among the 30 snSNPs, validation scores of 23 variations (76.7%) were greater than or equal to 3. The percent of variations of validation score greater than 9 was 7.32% (3/41) for the trSNPs and 35.5% (11/31) for the snSNPs.

The most striking difference between groups [S-C] and [M-C] was observed in amino acid substitutions from the aromatic R group (G2) to the polar, uncharged R group (G3) (1.9% vs 4.1%; see Figure 2). In addition, substitutions from the polar, uncharged R group (G3) to the aromatic R group (G2) were observed more often in group [M-C] than in group [S-C] (4.7% vs 2.0%). To measure the difference between the two types of variations, we calculated the chi-squared values with degrees of freedom\u200a=\u200a1. A significant difference was found (X 2\u200a=\u200a143.8, P<3.9\u00d710\u221233) between group [S-C] and group [M-C] in the frequency of G2-G3 substitutions. This result suggests the transition of amino acids between G2 and G3 could potentially exert deleterious effects on protein function. Differences in the frequency of G2-G4 and G1-G4 substitutions were notably high (X 2\u200a=\u200a39.7, P<3.0\u00d710\u221210 and X 2\u200a=\u200a102.2, P<5.2\u00d710\u221224, respectively). In contrast, amino acid substitutions between G3 and G5 occurred in group [S-C] slightly more often than in group [M-C] (3.4% vs 2.3%). Remarkably, in all amino acid groups, substitutions within the same amino acid group were more frequently observed in group [S-C] than in group [M-C]. We have summarized these results in Table 3, based on two types of amino acid substitutions\u2014those within the same amino acid group and those between different groups. The proportion of amino acid substitutions within the same group in group [S-C] was larger than in group [M-C] (38.0% vs 26.6%). For example, the frequency of substitutions from valine to isoleucine in the nonpolar, aliphatic R group was 2.4% in group [S-C], but 0.6% in group [M-C]. Similarly, the frequency of substitutions from isoleucine to valine in the nonpolar, aliphatic R group was 1.8% in group [S-C], while it was 0.4% in group [M-C]. This finding indicates that an amino acid substitution in an nsSNP may be less likely to change the function of a protein.

This is confirmed by the results of this analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 23676, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We observed that up to 8.11% of CVS in dbSNP are registered as CVM in HGMD, and 4.36% of the CVM in HGMD are registered as CVS in dbSNP. Among these concurrent CVs, there were 41 truncation variations, 10 of which were also found in the HapMap database. Some of the truncation CVs with low validation scores (Figure S1) were found to be disease-causing mutations. Heterozygosity information was available for 7 variations out of the 41. When we examined these seven concurrent CVs, two of them appeared to be nonsense mutations. The mutant alleles occurred in normal controls at relatively high frequencies due to founder effects, for example, rs17602729 or Gln12Term in the AMPD1 gene causing adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency, rs12948217 or Tyr231Term in the ASPA gene causing Canavan diseases, and rs11571833 or Lys3326Term in the BRCA2 gene causing hereditary breast and ovarian syndrome. The remaining CVs include apparently deleterious mutations at the molecular level, but their phenotypic effects, i.e., disease association, should be interpreted with caution. This is particularly the case for truncation CVs in the pharmacogenetics genes and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) (rs4986893 or Trp212Term in the CYP2C19 gene and rs1131156 or Ser14Term in the HLA-B gene). Thirty snSNPs were concurrent in HGMD, and 20 of them were also found in the HapMap database. When we reviewed the references linked to these 20 variations at HGMD, we found that most of them were snSNPs and were registered in the HGMD database since they were found to be associated with susceptibility mainly to common complex diseases such as diabetes (see reference links in Table S1). These observations indicate that some SNPs in dbSNP are truly phenotypically mutational, and the interpretation of their functional consequences should be based on the context of carriers in the general population (or specific populations in case of founder mutations), or in the context of the phenotypic impact of the mutant molecule (for example, drug metabolism). In addition, some truncation CVs need to be considered in the same context as copy number variations, which have been recently reported to be more common in the human genome than previously recognized. Some mutations in HGMD may be disease susceptibility SNPs with low penetrance or in linkage to other risk alleles. Although we examined the individual variations for these two types of concurrent variations only, that is, truncation mutations and snSNPs, our observations may be valid for at least some of the amino acid-substituting variations in the human genome that accounted for more than 90% of concurrent CVs.

The substitutions between G2 and G3 occurred in 8.8% of total variations in group [M-C] and 3.9% in group [S-C]. The substitution frequency agrees well with the chemical distance (CD) from Grantham's chemical difference matrix (Table S4). Relatively frequent substitutions in group [M-C] tend to have long distances between amino acids, whereas relatively frequent substitutions in group [S-C] tend to have short distances between two amino acids. The substitution from cysteine (G2) to phenylalanine (G3) occurred four times more frequently in group [M-C] than in group [S-C], and the CD between cysteine and phenylalanine was 205.

In particular, the largest proportion of CVs (326/461; 70.7%) in the concurrent group [C] was predicted to be damaging (Table S5). This might include a large fraction of medically detrimental mutations that are not eliminated by purifying selection, possibly due to positive selection or mutation-selection balance. For variations in group [Ch], the proportion of variations predicted to be damaging was high (63/135; 46.7%), and the average allele frequency was relatively low, compared to those predicted to be neutral (Figure S2). The T-test result showed that the differences in allele frequencies between the two variations for each population were significant (P<0.05). We also found that some variations predicted to be damaging, such as rs16941 and rs2020873, showed strong evidence for positive selection (either an integrated haplotype score >2 or <\u22122) (Table S5). Evidence of positive selection may be helpful in identifying genetic variations associated with complex disease.
