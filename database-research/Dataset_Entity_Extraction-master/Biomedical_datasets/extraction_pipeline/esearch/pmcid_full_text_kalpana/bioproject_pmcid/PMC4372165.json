Tetranucleotide frequencies were calculated by a zero-order Markov method, which applies odds ratios of observed counts for the 256 unique 4-mers, normalized to their respective mononucleotide frequencies. In order to assess tetranucleotide signatures for DGR regions (~2\u2009kb each), while avoiding a compositional bias of flanking sequence, we concatenated DGR cassettes from both OTU1 and OTU2 and fragmented this DGR-specific sequence (~21\u2009kb) with a sliding window as above. In addition, sequences from RT genes and TP genes were separately concatenated and fragmented with a sliding window as above to compare tetranucleotide compositions for the two DGR components.
