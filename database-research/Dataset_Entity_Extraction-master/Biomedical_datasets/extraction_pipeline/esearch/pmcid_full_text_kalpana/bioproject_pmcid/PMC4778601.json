Here, we used Next-Generation Sequencing for the characterization of the transcriptional signature of the bovine endometrial tissue. Periovulatory endocrine environments were manipulated to generate two distinctly different fertility phenotypes. Cycling, non-lactating, multiparous Nelore cows were manipulated to ovulate larger (>\u00a013\u00a0mm; LF group; high fertility phenotype) or smaller (<\u00a012\u00a0mm; SF group) follicles. As a result, greater proestrus estrogen concentrations, corpora lutea and early diestrus progesterone concentrations were also observed in LF group in comparison to SF group. Endometrial cell proliferation was estimated by the protein marker MKI67 on tissues collected 4 (D4) and 7 (D7) days after induction of ovulation. Total RNA extracts from D7 were sequenced and compared according to the transcriptional profile of each experimental group (LF versus SF). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that LF and SF endometria were asynchronous in regards to their phenotype manifestation. Major findings indicated an LF endometrium that was switching phenotypes earlier than the SF one. More specifically, a proliferating SF endometrium was observed on D7, whereas the LF tissue, which expressed a proliferative phenotype earlier at D4, seemed to have already shifted towards a biosynthetically and metabolically active endometrium on D7. Data on MKI67 support the transcriptomic results. RNA-Seq-derived transcriptional profile of the endometrial tissue indicated a temporal effect of the periovulatory endocrine environment, suggesting that the moment of the endometrial exposure to the ovarian steroids, E2 and P4, regulates the timing of phenotype manifestation. Gene expression profiling revealed molecules that may be targeted to elucidate ovarian steroid-dependent mechanisms that regulate endometrial tissue receptivity. Data was deposited in the SRA database from NCBI (SRA Experiment SRP051330) and are associated with the Bio-Project (PRJNA270391). An overview of the gene expression data has been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and is accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE65450. Further assessment of the data in combination with other data sets exploring the transcriptional profile of the endometrial tissue during early diestrus may potentially identify novel molecular mechanisms and/or markers of the uterine receptivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2662, "infons": {"file": "t0005.xml", "id": "t0005", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table", "xml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<table xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">Specifications</td><td/></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Organism/cell line/tissue</td><td align=\"left\"><italic>Bos Taurus indicus</italic>; endometrial tissue fragments</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Sex</td><td align=\"left\">Female</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Sequencer or array type</td><td align=\"left\">Illumina HiScanSQ sequencer</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Data format</td><td align=\"left\">Raw Bio-Project PRJNA270391; SRA Experiment <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/SRP/SRP051/SRP051330/\" id=\"ir0010\">SRP051330</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Experimental factors</td><td align=\"left\">Large versus small ovulatory follicle</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Experimental features</td><td align=\"left\">Estrous cycle of Nelore non-lactating multiparous cows was manipulated aiming to obtain cows ovulating follicles either &lt;\u00a012\u00a0mm (small follicles) or &gt;\u00a013\u00a0mm (large follicles) in diameter.

Experiments were performed at the research farm of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Pirassununga, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Non-lactating, multiparous, cyclic (presenting a corpus luteum) Nelore (Bos indicus) cows, presenting no gross reproductive abnormalities by gynecological examination, ranging from 4 to 10\u00a0years old, weighing 461.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050.1\u00a0kg and presenting body condition score of 3.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33, participated in the study. Animals were maintained on Brachiaria pasture, and received supplementation based on sugar cane and/or corn silage, concentrate and minerals, according to their maintenance requirements, as well as water ad libitum. The pre-synchronization step consisted of two intramuscular injections of sodium cloprostenol (PGF; 0.5\u00a0mg; Sincrocio, Ouro Fino, Cravinhos, Brazil), 14\u00a0days apart. At the second PGF administration (D-20) an ESTROTECT Heat detector patch was placed between the hip and the tail head of eighty-three cows (Rockway, Inc. Spring Valley, WI, USA). Animals were observed for signs of estrus behavior twice daily from D-19 to D-16 and once daily from D-15 to D-10. Only animals that had a recent (current cycle) and PGF-responsive CL (at least 5\u00a0days old) on D-10 stayed in the experiment. After the pre-synchronization, cows that had P4 <\u00a01.0\u00a0ng/mL or were not detected in estrus were removed from the experiment (N\u00a0=\u00a09). The remaining cows (N\u00a0=\u00a074) were implanted with an intravaginal P4-releasing device (1\u00a0g; Sincrogest, Ourofino) on D-10 and received an intramuscular injection of 2\u00a0mg estradiol benzoate (Sincrodiol, Ourofino). Simultaneously, approximately half of the cows received an intramuscular injection of PGF. Progesterone-releasing devices were removed, prior to GnRH injection, from cows that received (large follicle group; LF; N\u00a0=\u00a035) and cows that did not receive PGF at device insertion (small follicle group; SF; N\u00a0=\u00a039). At device removal, all animals received two PGF injections, 6\u00a0h apart. Ovulation was induced by an injection of 10\u00a0\u03bcg Buserelin on D0 (Sincroforte, Ourofino). According to Mesquita et al. 2014, by design, animals were excluded from data analyses if: progesterone concentration on D-10 was less than 1\u00a0ng/mL, progesterone concentration on D-2 was greater than 3\u00a0ng/mL in the LF group, progesterone concentration on D-2 was less than 2\u00a0ng/mL in the SF group, dominant follicle diameter on D-0 was less than 8\u00a0mm, ovulation was detected at the D-0 ultrasound examination or before (i.e., early ovulation), ovulation was detected at the D-3 ultrasound examination (i.e., late ovulation), ovulation was not detected, or follicular, luteal cysts or lesions impairing animal well-being were detected at any moment during the experiment. Animals that responded to treatments as defined by design were slaughtered on D7 post-induction of ovulation (N\u00a0=\u00a060). Transrectal ultrasound examinations were performed on day 10, daily from day \u2212\u00a02 to day 0 and from day 3 to day 7, and every 12\u00a0h from day 1 to day 2. Examinations were performed with the aid of a duplex B-mode and pulsed-wave color Doppler ultrasound instrument (MyLab30 Vet Gold; Esaote Healthcare, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) equipped with a multi-frequency linear transducer. Ovulation was defined as the disappearance of the preovulatory follicle previously identified followed by the identification of the development of a corpus luteum on the same approximate topographical location on the ovary. The diameter of follicles and CLs was calculated as the average between measurements of two perpendicular axes of each structure. Progesterone concentrations for days \u2212\u00a010, \u2212\u00a06 and \u2212\u00a02, and from day 1 until day 7 were determined by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay (Coat-a-count, DPC, Los Angeles, USA), whereas plasma E2 concentrations for days \u2212\u00a02, \u2212\u00a01 and 0 were determined using a commercial RIA kit (Double Antibody Estradiol, DPC, Los Angeles, USA) as validated previously.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 8014, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Animal ranking and selection for transcriptional profiling", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 8073, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Of all slaughtered animals, endometrial fragments of six (three/group) were selected to be submitted to RNA-Seq.
