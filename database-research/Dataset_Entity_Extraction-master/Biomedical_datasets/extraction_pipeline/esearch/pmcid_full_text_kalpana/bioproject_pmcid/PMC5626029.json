After matching, we included 1,256 cases and 4,619 controls. The primary exposure was concomitant gabapentin use in the 120 days preceding the index date. A secondary analysis characterized gabapentin dose as low (<900 mg daily), moderate (900 to 1,799 mg daily), or high (\u22651,800 mg daily). A sensitivity analysis examined the effect of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in the preceding 120 days. Overall, 12.3% of cases (155 of 1,256) and 6.8% of controls (313 of 4,619) were prescribed gabapentin in the prior 120 days.

More specifically, it likely reflects additive respiratory depression as well as increased gabapentin concentrations with concomitant opioid use. A pharmacokinetic interaction most likely reflects increased gabapentin absorption, which occurs primarily in the upper small intestine. Thus, opioid-induced slowing of gastrointestinal transit could prolong the time spent within this narrow absorption window and increase gabapentin bioavailability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25919, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has important implications for public health, particularly given the high degree of co-prescription. Almost 10% of patients treated with an opioid in our study also used gabapentin, while nearly half of patients treated with gabapentin were co-prescribed opioids. Similarly, studies from the United States and United Kingdom have estimated that between 15% and 22% of people with opioid use disorder are also misusing gabapentin. Gabapentin is frequently used as an adjunct to opioids for neuropathic pain syndromes, but physicians may not be aware of the potential for respiratory depression with this drug; thus, increased awareness among patients and clinicians about the potential for a life-threatening interaction between these drugs is essential. When co-prescription is necessary, strategies for minimizing the sequelae of this interaction should be considered, including cautious dose titration, dose adjustment in the setting of co-morbid lung and kidney disease, and avoidance of other CNS depressants. In addition, patients treated with this combination should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if symptoms of opioid overdose occur. Finally, because of pregabalin\u2019s pharmacologic similarities to gabapentin, it is possible that pregabalin imparts a similar risk of overdose and death among opioid users, a hypothesis supported in part by cases of respiratory depression associated with this drug. We were unable to test this hypothesis in our study due to the low prevalence of pregabalin prescribing over our study period (pregabalin only became available on the public drug program in 2013), but suggest that this is an important area of future research.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27618, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study has several strengths, including its large size, the use of population-based coroner\u2019s records to ascertain opioid-related deaths, and the specificity of the association of gabapentin co-prescription and opioid-related death (as evidenced by there being no such association between co-prescription of NSAIDs and opioid-related death). However, some limitations merit discussion. First, our study was limited to a population of individuals eligible for public drug coverage in Ontario, which includes the elderly (aged 65 and older) and younger individuals receiving social assistance. Approximately 95% of the cases and matched controls were younger than 65 years, which led the overall cohort to be generally of lower socioeconomic status (over 40% were in the lowest income quintile). Therefore, these findings may not be generalizable to the broader population of opioid users. Second, we were only able to identify prescriptions reimbursed by the government and dispensed from retail pharmacies. We could not determine drug adherence, whether individuals obtained additional drugs through cash payments or illicit purchases, or whether they were using their prescription opioids as prescribed. While it is possible that this could bias our analysis towards a significant finding if people concomitantly taking gabapentin and opioids were more likely to source opioids illicitly, our finding that heroin involvement in opioid-related deaths was highly concentrated among people not exposed to gabapentin suggests that this had no major influence on our findings. Third, the CIs in our dose\u2013response analysis showed considerable overlap, and therefore the suggestion of a dose\u2013response gradient should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, we were unable to determine the indication for gabapentin use, and so could not confirm whether these medications were being used to treat pain or for indications such as anxiety or depression. However, it is likely that the majority of gabapentin prescribing in this study was for a pain indication due to its concurrent use with opioids. Finally, despite matching on several demographic and clinical variables (including a disease risk index), our cases and controls differed on a number of measured covariates. Confounding by indication is also possible, particularly among patients receiving the highest doses of gabapentin or opioids, for whom severe pain could be a manifestation of serious underlying illness. However, we believe that confounding by indication did not have considerable influence on our findings for several reasons. First, we used a disease risk index to match cases to controls on a number of factors, including diagnoses commonly associated with pain. Second, because we adjusted for opioid dose in all of our analyses, our findings for gabapentin exposure are representative of the additional risk of opioid-related death beyond that which is explained by escalating opioid doses. Third, we adjusted our analyses for markers of severity of underlying disease, including comorbidity, medications, and health service use, and excluded individuals receiving palliative care and those with a prior cancer diagnosis. Finally, our tracer analysis found no association of NSAID co-prescription with opioid-related death, suggesting that underlying pain is not obfuscating our findings, and further mitigating concerns about confounding by indication.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31048, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31059, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study we found that, among patients prescribed opioids, co-prescription of gabapentin was associated with a considerable increase in the risk of opioid-related death, particularly at higher doses.
