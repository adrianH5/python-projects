Previous studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are selectively enriched after chemotherapy through enhanced survival. Here we reveal a new mechanism by which bladder CSCs actively contribute to therapeutic resistance via an unexpected proliferative response to re-populate residual tumours between chemotherapy cycles, using human bladder cancer xenografts. Further analyses demonstrate the recruitment of a quiescent label-retaining pool of CSCs into cell division in response to chemotherapy-induced damages, similar to mobilization of normal stem cells during wound repair. While chemotherapy effectively induces apoptosis, associated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release paradoxically promotes neighbouring CSC repopulation. This repopulation can be abrogated by a PGE2-neutralizing antibody and celecoxib drug-mediated blockade of PGE2 signalling. In vivo administration of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitor celecoxib effectively abolishes a PGE2- and COX2-mediated wound response gene signature, and attenuates progressive manifestation of chemoresistance in xenograft tumours, including primary xenografts derived from a patient who was resistant to chemotherapy. Collectively, these findings uncover a new underlying mechanism that models the progressive development of clinical chemoresistance, and implicate an adjunctive therapy to enhance chemotherapeutic response of bladder urothelial carcinomas by abrogating early tumour repopulation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1726, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care for many advanced carcinomas. Although chemotherapy is effective in debulking tumour mass, certain patients show initial response but progressively become unresponsive after multiple treatments. Chemotherapy is administered in cycles to induce fractionated killing of unsynchronized proliferating cancer cells, and treatments are spaced out to allow recovery of normal tissues between cycles. However, repopulation of residual surviving cancer cells also occurs, which is an undesirable phenomenon that limits chemotherapeutic response in subsequent cycles. Recent studies demonstrated that CSCs have a survival advantage in response to chemotherapy. Here we investigate the unexplored concept that CSCs may actively proliferate in response to chemotherapy-induced damages, similar to how tissue resident stem cells mobilize to wound sites during tissue repair.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2640, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Bladder urothelial carcinomas contain cells that span various cellular differentiation stages, cytokeratin 14 (CK14) marks the most primitive (or least differentiated) cells and patients with abundant CK14 staining correlate with poor survival. Here, comparative analysis of matching pre- and post-chemotherapy patient tissues revealed one group with CK14 staining enrichment/persistence (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c) and another group with no CK14 staining after chemotherapy (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a, b, d). Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis revealed patients with CK14+ cancer cell enrichment/persistence showed worse survival (Fig. 1a), justifying further need to investigate their chemotherapeutic response. Using the standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced bladder urothelial carcinomas (that is, gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC)), one chemotherapy cycle effectively reduced the growth rate of all xenograft tumours in comparison to controls (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a), while leading to a generalized enrichment of CK14+ cancer cells (1.7\u20134.3-fold) (Fig. 1c, d and Extended Data Fig. 2b, c). This enrichment is unexpectedly contributed by proliferation marked by mitosis phaseprotein phosphohistone H3 (Extended Data Fig. 2d, e; white arrows). In addition to the conventional thinking that chemotherapy selects for chemoresistant cancer cells, this active proliferative response may represent a new mechanism contributing to repopulation of residual tumours. To investigate this phenomenon further, we constructed a lentiviral reporter to enable prospective isolation of CK14+ cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), as CK14 is an intracellular protein that would not allow for cell surface antibody labelling. We sub-cloned a previously validated gene promoter region of human KRT14 (ref.) into a promoterless lentiviral vector carrying a tdTomato (hK14. tdTomato) red fluorescent protein (Extended Data Fig. 3a). With this reporter stably transduced into urothelial carcinoma cells (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3b\u2013d), we could readily detect a tdTomato+ (Tm+) subpopulation that exclusively expressed CK14 at the protein (Fig. 1f; white arrows) and messenger RNA (Fig. 1g; KRT14) levels, while minimally expressing the differentiation marker uroplakin1B (Fig. 1g; UPK1B). These Tm+ CK14+ urothelial carcinoma cells represented a subpopulation of our previously reported CD44+CD49f+ CSCs (Extended Data Fig. 3b\u2013d). Additional functional evaluation validated their unique biological properties being enriched for sphere-forming stem cells in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and tumorigenic cells when engrafted in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 3f), thus demonstrating accepted functional criteria for CSCs. To evaluate their chemotherapeutic response, we purified Tm+ CK14+ and Tm\u2212 CK14\u2212 cancer cells and evaluated their relative cell viability after GC chemotherapy (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 4). Tm+ CK14+cancer cells survived chemotherapy-induced apoptosis significantly better than Tm\u2212 CK14\u2212 cells starting at day 3 (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 4). Concurrent cell cycle analyses revealed an unexpected proliferative response of both subpopulations by entering into S phase at days 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 1i, j and Extended Data Fig. 5). Interestingly, Tm\u2212 CK14\u2212 cancer cells remained proliferative throughout the 11-day time course, whereas Tm+ CK14+ cancer cells gradually returned to a less proliferative state (Fig. 1i, j and Extended Data Fig. 5). Because gemcitabine (a cytidine analogue) and cisplatin preferentially incorporate into proliferating cells to initiate apoptosis via inducing DNA crosslinks, strand breaks and adduct formation, we propose that the slower cycling properties of CK14+ cells may provide one mechanism by which they evade GC chemotherapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6482, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To explore this hypothesis in vivo, we used the classical pulse-chase labelling approach to mark quiescent cells, followed by chemotherapy treatment to analyse their proliferative response (Fig. 2a). We repetitively pulsed xenograft tumours with the thymidine analogue 5-iodo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (IdU), followed by a 4\u20138-week chase period, during which dividing cells diluted out IdU whereas quiescent cells retained IdU (Fig. 2a). Effective IdU pulsing was validated (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and a quiescent cancer subpopulation (1.08\u20135.48%) was consistently found (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013d), which we term label-retaining cancer cells (LRCCs) (green cells in Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). These IdU+ LRCCs predominately localized within CK14+ cells (Fig. 2b, c; red) and were mutually exclusive to proliferating cells labelled by 5-chloro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (CldU) (Fig. 2b; white) or other proliferation markers (Extended Data Fig. 6e\u2013g). Notably, chemotherapy significantly reduced the fraction of CldU+ proliferating cells while not altering IdU+ LRCCs initially (Fig. 2d, e; 6 h). These results confirmed our in vitro findings that gemcitabine and cisplatin preferentially induce apoptosis of dividing cells (Fig. 1h, i). This is paradoxically followed by a significant increase in IdU+ LRCCs that were simultaneously incorporated with CldU (Fig. 2d, e; 12 h). These IdU+ CldU+ cells constantly appeared as a two-cell state immediate adjacent to each other (Fig. 2d; yellow cells), suggestive of LRCC recruitment to divide after chemotherapy-induced apoptotic damage. This trend coincided with an increase in CldU+ proliferating and CK14+ cancer cells (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 6h;12 h), which gradually decreased from 24 h and onwards, corresponding with a plateau of single CldU+ proliferating cancer cells (Fig. 2e). Collectively, these results illustrate that quiescent LRCCs are unexpectedly recruited into cell division after chemotherapy treatment, contributing to repopulation of residual tumours.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8509, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Next, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying tumour repopulation. After chemotherapy, it is known that soluble factors are released from apoptotic cells to attract immune cells for clearance. Paradoxically, some of these factors are also known to stimulate epithelial cell proliferation during wound repair. One example is PGE2, which was demonstrated to promote stem-cell expansion and mobilization. Here, we investigate PGE2 and CSCs in the context of chemotherapy, which was not studied previously. Urothelial carcinoma cells were exposed to chemotherapy in vitro (Fig. 3a) and their viability was quantified by flow cytometry analyses of mitochondrial and plasma membrane permeability (Fig. 3b) and by cleaved caspase-3 (CASP3) (Fig. 3c). The time kinetics of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3b, c) is closely associated with an increase in the expression of COX2 (the enzyme mediating PGE2 production) and PGE2 release (Fig. 3d). We further validated these findings in vivo, by analysing the co-localization of PGE2, CASP3 and CK14+ cancer cells, and their associated changes after chemotherapy (Fig. 3e, f). Similar to in vitro, chemotherapy induced apoptosis as measured by a CASP3-positive stain, which peaked at 6 h and gradually reduced thereafter (Fig. 3e, f), which was closely followed by PGE2 release from 6 to 24 h after chemotherapy (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, PGE2 localization (Fig. 3e; red) was often found adjacent to CK14+ cancer cells (Fig. 3e; green). Altogether, these findings demonstrated that chemotherapy-induced apoptosis is closely followed by the release of PGE2, which preceded that of tumour repopulation (Fig. 3g).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10168, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To establish a biological role for PGE2 in promoting tumour repopulation, we investigated how exogenous dmPGE2 (a stabilized PGE2 analogue) could modulate sphere-forming stem cells in vitro. Exogenous dmPGE2 treatment significantly increased the frequency of sphere-forming cells (Fig. 3h). To evaluate PGE2 in the context of chemotherapy, we applied PGE2-containing supernatant obtained from chemotherapy-treated cells to urothelial carcinoma cells (Fig. 3a), and compared their sphere-forming ability to those receiving exogenous dmPGE2 (Fig. 3i). Although both conditions significantly induced sphere-forming cells, supernatant from chemotherapy-treated cells induced a higher frequency (Fig. 3i). Notably, functional blockade of PGE2 by a neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the ability of factor-containing supernatant to generate sphere-forming cells (Fig. 3i). Furthermore, the addition of the pharmacological COX2 inhibitor celecoxib, alone or in combination with a PGE2 neutralizing antibody, further reduced their frequencies (Fig. 3i).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11223, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Because more than 70% of patients with advanced bladder cancer do not benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and celecoxib is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug, we evaluated whether the attenuation of PGE2 signalling in vivo could enhance chemotherapeutic response (Fig. 4a). Although chemotherapy is clinically administered in multiple cycles, few preclinical studies administered chemotherapy beyond one cycle or a single dose. To bridge this gap, we recapitulated the clinical regimen (Fig. 4a\u2013e) in advanced bladder cancer xenografts, including one derived from a patient who was resistant to chemotherapy (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 1a). During the first chemotherapy cycle, both PDX-3 and T24 xenograft lines were responsive to chemotherapy (GC) and combination therapy (celecoxib plus GC) by reducing tumour size (Fig. 4b, e; days 3\u201312). Nevertheless, celecoxib combination treatment did abrogate notable expansion of CK14+ cancer cells induced by chemotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013c). Remarkably, manifestation of chemoresistance occurred progressively after successive chemotherapy cycles (Fig. 4b, e; black circle), and celecoxib combination treatment (celecoxib plus GC) enhanced chemotherapeutic response more evidently in later treatment cycles (Fig. 4b, e; asterisk). T24 bladder cancer xenografts were limited to two chemotherapy cycles owing to distal lung metastases, and celecoxib combination treatment significantly diminished metastatic lung foci (Fig. 4c, d). Because celecoxib is known to suppress prostacyclin and predisposes patients to thrombosis, patients with cancer prescribed celecoxib as adjuvant therapy will probably be co-administered with low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection.

Global gene expression profiling further revealed a parallel to tissue wound response, that chemoresistant tumours elicited enrichment of a \u2018wound-response gene signature\u2019 (Fig. 4f, g and Extended Data Fig. 9a, b), which could be abrogated by combination celecoxib treatment (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9c). The PTGS2 gene, which encodes COX2 and is a core pathway component for PGE2 signalling, is among these wound-response genes (Fig. 4g, h). Similar findings were found in human bladder carcinomas that are resistant to chemotherapy (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 9a, d, e), thus confirming the importance and generalization of PGE2/COX2 signalling during development of chemoresistance, while other metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway may also be involved. By validating the efficacy of celecoxib in abrogating chemoresistance in xenografts derived from a patient who was resistant to chemotherapy, this preclinical finding provides considerable implications for immediate clinical translation, as the standard of care for advanced bladder cancers is limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery with no other therapeutics.
