The de Bruijn graph stage (pre-unitig) of the assembly was used to optimize the overlap parameter, k-mer length, and the effect of inclusion of longer reads was assessed. The contiguity metrics N50 (solid curves, left y-axis) and N20 (dotted curves, right y-axis) are shown for assemblies that use the short reads only (blue) and short and long reads (black). The contiguity of the two datasets peaked for different k-mer lengths, with dataset of short and long reads having a maximum N50 and a maximum N20 for the same k = 109 bp. For short reads only, optimization with respect to N20 resulted in a slightly lower k-mer length (98 bp) compared with optimization with respect to N50 (101 bp), both of which are lower than the optimum k-mer length for the full dataset. Longer k-mers were desirable, as they help disambiguate longer repeat motifs", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 18211, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The first assembly stage can further be conceptualized in two parts, with roughly equal run times. The first part provides preliminary unitigs and a graph representing their adjacency, which is defined as (k-1) bp overlaps, where k is the primary assembly parameter denoting the minimum read-to-read overlap length that is considered specific enough for assembly. The second part eliminates short redundant unitigs, when their neighbors on both sides share more than a certain length of sequence (default: 10 bp), and enables further graph simplification. We based the preliminary assessment of assembly quality on the first part of the first stage, and optimized our assembly parameters, using the pre-unitig contiguity statistics (Fig. 1).

Controlled for the misassemblies, contig or scaffold N50 lengths are widely used quality metrics for genome assemblies. We demonstrate that the optimum pre-unitig N50 occurred at k = 109 bp when using both short and long reads, and at k = 101 bp when using just the short reads. Thus, we observe that incorporating the modest low coverage long read data from the MiSeq allowed us to use a more stringent overlap parameter for the assembly process, and resulted in improved assembly statistics. Optimum k using short and long read data yielded N50 = 1335 bp, whereas the optimum k using short read data only yielded N50 = 1236 bp. The difference between assembly contiguity numbers (7.4%) became more pronounced when the assembly process proceeded to use 158 million and 186 million pre-unitigs in these two cases, respectively, to construct unitigs (9.7%), contigs (9.8%) and scaffolds (17.8%).
