Here we report four patients suffering from cholera attributed to serogroup O139 V. cholerae.

Since natural infection with V. cholerae O1 or vaccination with currently available licensed cholera vaccines (e.g., Dukoral) provides little protection against O139, we conclude that V. cholerae O139 remains in circulation and is still causing a low incidence of cholera.

The isolation of O139 from clinical cases declined quickly after the initial outbreak, with the exception of one epidemic in August 2002 in Dhaka city. Following on from this, isolates of the O139 serogroup were also isolated sporadically from clinical and environmental samples from various regions of Bangladesh during 2005, although no large-scale outbreaks of cholera attributed to O139 serogroup V. cholerae were reported during this time.

It is clear from these data that the isolates causing the current (seventh) pandemic of cholera form a highly related monophyletic lineage dominated by isolates of the El Tor biotype and of the O1 serogroup. This phylogeny, based on whole genome sequence of clinical isolates, shows three overlapping global expansions of V. cholerae since the pandemic began, denoted wave I, II, and III. From sequencing of a limited number of O139 isolates, it has been shown that they form a single distinct phylogenetic branch that falls within wave II of the seventh pandemic El Tor lineage. At one time, O139 isolates were thought to represent a new lineage of V. cholerae that would spread globally and perhaps even replace the O1 serogroup. Since the O139 serogroup of V. cholerae was first recognized, it has been included in cholera surveillance initiatives and in vaccine design efforts. However, pandemic wave II O139 and O1 serogroup isolates are increasingly rare, being replaced almost exclusively by O1 serogroup wave III strains, causing disease globally. Here we report the isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of recent isolates of V. cholerae O139 recovered from stools of patients hospitalized at the icddr,b diarrheal hospital, as well as from asymptomatic members of the patients\u2019 households.

Based on the mapped genome data, this isolate was highly divergent from all other sequenced O1 and O139 isolates in this study and described previously. Although this isolate was confirmed as belonging to the O139 serogroup using traditional techniques, sequence analysis showed that the genes for the O-antigen biosynthesis genes of this isolate were different from both the O1 and other O139 isolates. To investigate this in greater detail, the 84 contigs of the previously sequenced O139 cholera isolate MO10 were ordered against the O1 N16961 reference using ABACAS. The Artemis Comparison Tool was used to compare the ordered MO10 genome against the case 1 genome; the contiguated sequence of one area of the LPS operon in the case 1 isolate was used to correct the ordering of one of the MO10 contigs. A search in the NCBI database using blastn of the LPS operon sequence of the MO10 isolate found a hit against a 46.7kb sequence of Vibrio cholerae genes for O-antigen synthesis, O139 strain MO45 (accession AB012956.1).

Of note, oral killed cholera vaccine Shanchol is bivalent, and contains components of both O1 and O139 organisms, while other currently commercially available cholera vaccines are monovalent, providing protection against O1 alone. We are continuing with the surveillance of patients with acute watery diarrhea for detection of V. cholerae O139 to monitor emergence of new variants and also to detect any new and reemerging outbreaks or epidemics using microbiological and genomic analysis.
