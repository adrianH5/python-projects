Robust vertebrate animal models of primary RC dysfunction are needed to explore the effects of variation in RC disease subtypes, tissue-specific manifestations, and major pathogenic factors contributing to each disorder, as well as their pre-clinical response to therapeutic candidates. We have developed a series of zebrafish (Danio rerio) models that inhibit, to variable degrees, distinct aspects of RC function, and enable quantification of animal development, survival, behaviors, and organ-level treatment effects on function as well as mitochondrial biochemistry and physiology. Here, we characterize four pharmacologic inhibitor models of mitochondrial RC dysfunction in early larval zebrafish, including rotenone (complex I inhibitor), azide (complex IV inhibitor), oligomycin (complex V inhibitor), and chloramphenicol (mitochondrial translation inhibitor that leads to multiple RC dysfunction). A range of concentrations and exposure times of each RC inhibitor were systematically evaluated on early larval development, animal survival, integrated behaviors (touch and startle responses), organ physiology (brain death, neurologic tone, heart rate), and fluorescence-based mitochondrial physiology in zebrafish skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic RC inhibitor effects were validated by spectrophotometric analysis of Complex I, II and IV activities, or relative quantitation of ATP levels in larvae. Outcomes were prioritized that utilize in vivo animal imaging and quantitative behavioral assessments, as may optimally inform the translational potential of pre36 clinical drug screens for future clinical study in human mitochondrial disease subjects. The RC complex inhibitors each delayed early embryo development, with short-term exposures of these three agents or chloramphenicol from 5\u20137 days post fertilization also causing reduced larval survival and organ-specific defects ranging from brain death, behavioral and neurologic alterations, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in skeletal muscle (rotenone), and/or cardiac edema with visible blood pooling (oligomycin). Remarkably, we demonstrate that treating animals with probucol, a nutrient-sensing signaling network modulating drug that has been shown to yield therapeutic effects in a range of other RC disease cellular and animal models, both prevented acute rotenone-induced brain death in zebrafish larvae, and significantly rescued early embryo developmental delay from either rotenone or oligomycin exposure.

Indeed, nearly 300 unique genes in both the nucleus and mitochondria itself already implicated in primary mitochondrial diseases.

In addition, RC dysfunction is broadly implicated in the pathogenesis of a host of modern-day complex diseases ranging from metabolic syndrome to ischemia-reperfusion injury after stroke to neurodegenerative diseases. Regardless of cause, once RC dysfunction occurs, the effective result is the alteration of cellular NADH/NAD+ redox balance that influences a wide range of cellular reactions, as well as the induction of both oxidative and proteotoxic stress.

We also evaluated whether rotenone could induce organ-specific effects in fully developed animals at 7 dpf. Indeed, we found that treatment with 100 nM rotenone induced a reproducible brain death phenotype within 4 hours of rotenone exposure on 7 dpf (Fig 1D\u2013E), where 86% of rotenone-treated fish had developed grey brain together with an absent response to both touch and sound stimuli, indicating substantial cellular death occurs in their brain (Fig 1F).

Therefore, we co-injected newly fertilized eggs with TMRE and MTG FM to fluorescently label mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial content, respectively, throughout the cells of each animal. Based on the strong fluorescence intensity of these dyes and easy to identify landmarks in skeletal muscle tissue, we quantified the relative trunk muscle fluorescence brightness (Fig 1G\u2013H).

Given these results, we sought to develop a short-term model that would enable simultaneous quantitative profiling of azide effects on zebrafish survival, brain death, heart rate, and neurologic-based behaviors including startle response, touch response, and upright swimming (Fig 3). Specifically, all six of these outcome parameters were assessed in 3 biological replicates of 7 dpf larvae treated for 12 hours with 100 uM and 150 uM sodium azide relative to untreated control. All 6 outcomes showed a clear dose-dependence. Survival was preserved at 12 hours in the 100 uM azide treated larvae (Fig 3A) with few animals developing a gray brain, suggestive of brain death (Fig 3B), although their physiology was already substantially impaired with significant reductions in heart rate (Fig 3C), startle response (Fig 3D), touch response (Fig 3E), and upright swimming ability (Fig 3F). In comparison, larvae exposed to 150 uM azide on 6 dpf for 12 hours had significantly reduced survival (Fig 3A), greater than 80% incidence of gray brain suggestive of brain cell death (Fig 3B), and severely impaired physiology with very few animals having any heart rate (Fig 3C), startle response (Fig 3D) or touch response (Fig 3E) and complete absence of their upright swimming ability (Fig 3F). Thus, short-term azide exposure in fully-formed zebrafish larvae on 6 dpf results in dose- and time-dependent survival as well as physiologic and behavioral effects, including decreased heart rate, loss of motor function, inability to respond to tactile stimulation, as well as evidence of severe neurological brain damage.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26533, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "1.3.3 Zebrafish oligomycin model of complex V inhibition had reduced survivorship and abnormal cardiac function", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26645, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Mitochondrial complex V directly produces cellular energy in the chemical form of ATP by dissipating the proton gradient to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate within the mitochondrial matrix.

Oligomycin is a complex V inhibitor, which we evaluated as a means to produce an animal model of this disease with variable severity depending on concentration used. Wild-type larvae exposed to oligomycin from 2 dpf through 5 dpf were observed closely for survivorship and morphologically characterized compared to fish treated with ethanol as a vehicle control. Our results showed that exposing embryos to oligomycin substantially delayed their development by 36 hpf (Fig 4A).

Curiously, some variability was observed between different experimental days as the LD50 fluctuated between 2.5 mM and 5 mM. The lowest concentration of CAP did not appear to have any adverse effects on survival and all larvae remained healthy through 7 dpf, consistent with previously reported data. No early embryo developmental delay was seen with CAP between 2.5 and 6 mM concentrations. However, severe effects were observed over time at higher concentrations, particularly 6 mM CAP with which larvae did not survive beyond 6 dpf. Although we observed an LD50 at 2.5 mM CAP, the surviving larvae exhibited severe morphological defects when compared to healthy aged-matched controls (Fig 5B).

Therefore, we quantified their inhibitory effects on complex I, II, and IV electron transport chain enzyme specific activities or total larval ATP content. Mitochondrial-enriched larval fractions were prepared from flash-frozen zebrafish larvae populations that had been treated in vivo with each drug, where RC inhibitor time points and/or concentrations evaluated for biochemical assays were less than the lethal (LD50) dose used in the in vivo phenotype assays since dead larvae quickly disintegrate and do not provide suitable tissue for biochemical analysis. Surprisingly, rotenone 100 nM treatment for 4 hours on 7 pdf led to only a 20% decrease in complex I activity (data not shown), whereas the same treatment led to the development of grey brain death in 86% of treated fish (Fig 1F); we suspect this discrepancy was a technical artefact since the larvae possible to collect for further study were the few still alive after 4 hours of rotenone exposure. In contrast, we were able to clearly see the azide effect on complex IV activities (Fig 5C). Even at the lower concentration (50 uM), earlier time point (5 dpf) and shorter duration (8 hours) of azide studied, conditions that did not yield behavioral abnormalities, larval complex IV activity was drastically decreased by more than 60%. The inhibitory effect of azide was dose-dependent and selective for inhibition of complex IV, not complex I or complex II (Fig 5C). Similarly, in vivo treatment with the mitochondrial translation inhibitor, chloramphenicol, also led to a significant decrease in both complex I and complex IV activities, with no change in complex II activity (Fig 5D). The absence of chloramphenicol effect on complex II activity supports its known specificity for inhibition of the mitochondrial translation system, as mtDNA-encoded subunits are part of complexes I and IV but not complex II. Finally, the mitochondrial complex V (ATP synthase) inhibitor, oligomycin, treatment of zebrafish larvae at 10 nM, 100 nM, and 200 nM did not show any significant change in ETC enzyme activities (data not shown), as expected. However, ATP levels in fish homogenate were significantly decreased by 32% (Fig. 5E), consistent with in vivo complex V inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin.

Specifically, we tested whether probucol, an agent showing therapeutic benefit in diverse RC disease models as discussed above, can rescue developmental delay in the early treatment embryo models of rotenone, azide, and oligomycin that inhibit complex I, IV, and V, respectively. We created a grading scale to describe developmental stages when treatment was started at 4\u20136 hpf for the embryo developmental stage assessed at approximately 30 hpf: (stage 1) 28\u201330 hpf stage with normal head and tail bud, (stage 2) 22 hpf stage with smaller head and bent tail, (stage 3) 18 hpf stage with small head and minimal tail extension, (stage 4) 10 hpf stage with no distinguishable head or tail extension (Fig 6A). Using this scoring system, we calculated the average developmental stage of embryos exposed to each RC inhibitor alone or with concurrent 50 uM probucol treatment from 6 hpf through 30 hpf (Fig 6B). Interestingly, probucol significantly rescued embryo develop on exposure to rotenone (p < 0.002) or oligomycin (p < 0.004), but not azide.

Thus, the early embryo rotenone exposure assay provides an easily scorable early developmental phenotype, quantifiable within a 36 hour timeframe. These results are consistent with previous studies in which rotenone induced developmental delay, although a similar concentration to what was used in our studies appeared to have a less severe effect. In addition, once larval development was complete, brief rotenone exposure for only 4 hours on 7 dpf reproducibly caused brain cell death and loss of behavioral responses, as well as a significant reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential quantifiable in skeletal muscle. Rotenone has previously been attempted to establish a zebrafish model for Parkinson\u2019s disease in 7 dpf larvae, although a four-fold lower dose of rotenone used in that study (25 nM) reportedly failed to cause detectable problems in larval behavior, brain physiology or dopaminergic neurons. Interestingly, another group showed that 4 week chronic exposure of adult zebrafish to rotenone does induce symptoms comparable to those seen in Parkinson Disease. Remarkably, when we used the 7 dpf acute rotenone exposure model to test probucol, a candidate mitochondrial disease therapy, we found that probucol pre-treatment substantially prevented zebrafish larval brain death upon subsequent rotenone exposure. This therapeutic effect in a mitochondrial RC disorder is consistent with our prior reported study of probucol in other animal and cell models, where probucol both prevented and reversed an otherwise lethal renal focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-like disease in a Pdss2 genetic mouse model of coenzyme Q10 deficiency, rescued lifespan in a C. elegans gas-1(fc21) model of genetic-based complex I (NDUFS2 homologue), and rescued cellular viability in RC deficient patient cells. Thus, finding physiologic benefit of probucol in an acute rotenone exposure model of brain death demonstrates the potential utility of cross-species investigations to evaluate a candidate compound\u2019s therapeutic efficacy, and clearly demonstrates the feasibility and utility of the acute rotenone pharmacologic zebrafish larvae model for effectively screening organ-specific outcomes of potential candidate therapies for RC disease.

The azide moiety binds to the heme iron of cytochrome a3 when it is in its oxidized (ferric, Fe3+) state, and thus inhibits the redox cycling of cytochrome c through the activity of cytochrome c oxidase. The basic toxicology of sodium azide in the larval zebrafish model has only been investigated in the last several years, and the effects of azide are dependent on the age and developmental stage of the zebrafish larvae. D. rerio embryos can be developmentally arrested within the first 24 hrs post-fertilization by subjecting the embryos to anoxia. Further, the arrest can be maintained for up to 25 hours without damage to the embryos, which will continue to develop normally if normoxia is reestablished. Anoxia inhibits the normal activity of the mitochondrial RC, as oxygen is not available to act as the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport system of the RC. We postulated that chronic exposure of young zebrafish embryos to compounds which inhibit the mitochondrial RC may show a similar effect, and that sodium azide inhibition of complex IV will result in developmental arrest of the embryos in a dose-specific manner. The degree of developmental arrest (complete arrest versus developmental delay) was indeed found to be proportional to the degree that RC function is disrupted by toxicant treatment in our \u201cchronic azide exposure\u201d model, in which embryos from 3\u20135 hpf were exposed to varying concentrations of sodium azide for 7 days to evaluate the effects on embryonic and larval development. In addition, fully-developed larval zebrafish exposed to toxicants that inhibit electron transport, impede oxidative phosphorylation capacity, and limit ATP production may display deleterious effects in a dose-responsive manner. Indeed, we describe a highly informative \u201cacute, short-term exposure\u201d model of fully formed zebrafish larvae exposed to varying concentrations of sodium azide model starting on 6 dpf for 12\u201324 hrs. Zebrafish at this age are no longer able to be reversibly arrested in their development, as are the early embryos and instead display effects such as decreased heartrate, loss of motor function, inability to respond to tactile stimulation, severe neurological damage, and, at high doses, increased mortality.

Future biochemical characterization of oligomycin-treated zebrafish tissues will likely advance the understanding of the precise relationship between complex V inhibition magnitude and specific pathophysiology with the observed organ-level and behavioral phenotypes. The close resemblance of this chemical inhibition-based model of complex V deficiency with genetic models in zebrafish and humans is encouraging, and suggests that the oligomycin model may enable deeper understanding of the currently poorly understood biochemical processes that become altered in primary complex V deficiency.
