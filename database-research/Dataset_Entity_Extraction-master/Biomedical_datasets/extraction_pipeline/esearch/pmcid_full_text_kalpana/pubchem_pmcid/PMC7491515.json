Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications. Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265 biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession, PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA,TNF-\u221d, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2). These trends align with proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology.

COVID-19 has created major challenges for worldwide health systems, caused global disruption, and far-reaching consequences to the global economy.

High recombination rates and genetic diversity of coronaviruses in the wild suggest that further outbreaks and unpredictable virulence will likely arise in future recombinants, which could lead to different outcomes in patients. Serious clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (in some individuals) include: severe acute respiratory syndrome, inflammatory pneumonitis, hypoxia, blood clots, embolisms, gastrointestinal illness, cardiac and vascular damage, and organ damage (lung, heart, kidney, liver, brain). Severity and mortality of COVID-19 appear to be more prevalent in men (3.1/million) than women (2.7/million) and, overall more so in the elderly with underlying health conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immunosenescence, immunocompromised systems, and diabetes. Clinical observations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients report lymphopenia and monocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, as well as elevated pro inflammatory cytokines (\u201ccytokine storm\u201d). In severe cases, pneumonia with a \u201cground glass\u201d opacity in chest CT scans, lung injury, and pneumonitis are typically observed. Lymphopenia and the cytokine storm may initiate severe COVID-19 pathogenesis, viral sepsis, inflammatory-induced lung injury and pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and death.

In this effort, we have found a number of issues. For example, we note that the same biomarker is often known by multiple different names in the domain of biomarkers, which might differ from the name used in standardized databases - thus potentially making the connection between biomarker and underlying biology less amenable to discovery. One such case is Carbohydrate Antigen 15\u20133, also commonly known as Krebs von den Lungen-6, which is called Mucin-1 in UniProtKB. Our knowledgebase has solved these discrepancies by including all such entries identified by respective studies, and then unifying them under common identifier links to standardized databases. Another issue involves discerning exactly what is being measured. For example, what substance is being assayed when using alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as a biomarker? Is it alanine aminotransferase 1, alanine aminotransferase 2, or both? It is both. Finally, there is a chance that a biomarker obtained from one source could be diagnostic for a particular disease, but that same biomarker obtained from a different source might not be. For example, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) isolated from ovarian cysts appears to distinguish between malignant vs benign cysts, but that same substance is only prognostic (for a number of diseases) when obtained from blood.

Additionally, we also identified multiple biomarkers rarely mentioned in connection with COVID-19. Antithrombin, von Willebrand factor (VWF), Citrullinated H3 (Cit-H3), macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF), and Ewing Sarcoma RNA binding protein (EWS) were leading rare biomarkers that showed potential for further investigation.

A high level of CRP indicates disease progression and has been positively correlated with lung lesions. It has been used as a monitoring biomarker in early stages of the disease to determine progression from mild to severe. IL-6 expression is high in lung and arteries for healthy individual. IL-6 is a known cancer biomarker. It was also used as a disease progression monitoring biomarker in multiple studies and its elevated levels were shown to be strongly associated with respiratory failure in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Diagnosticians have used this biomarker to determine the need for mechanical ventilation. Other interleukins, such as IL-4 and IL-2, were also proposed in some studies. Of note, interleukins can be both pro and anti-inflammatory, and as such, use of these biomarkers should be coupled with other indicators of disease progression. Interestingly, Herold et al. found no correlation between IL-6 levels and age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate, or qSofa score of patients; on the other hand, IL-4 was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication partially through down regulation of ACE2 expression in vitro. While this study investigated SARS-CoV and not SARS-CoV-2, research advises screening of all patients for hyper inflammation and the use of inflammation biomarkers to assess severity of disease. NLR was also suggested as a prognostic biomarker in over 10 independent studies. It has been commonly used as a marker for subclinical or systemic inflammation and a high NLR has been linked to poor clinical outcome in many solid tumors. For COVID-19 patients of advanced age, this ratio, if elevated, should serve as a prognostic biomarker to determine access to valuable limited clinical resources like intensive care units (ICUs) or ventilators. Another biomarker reported by multiple research groups, in agreement with aggravated inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients, is SAA. SAA was used as both a monitoring and a prognostic biomarker by multiple independent research groups to evaluate severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Dynamic changes in SAA have been proposed as prognostic markers in COVID-19 progression. This is because it belongs to the family of apolipoproteins that are constitutively expressed in plasma. SAA is a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation. MCSF, another biomarker that plays an important role in macrophage homeostasis, and has been proposed as a therapeutic target that warrants further analysis. A common theme from our resource points to the immune system of the patients and the inflammatory response to the disease. Other concurrent biomarkers in our resource are tumor necrosis factor-\u221d (TNF-\u221d), interferon-\u03d2 inducible protein-10 (IP-10), CD4+ counts and CD8+ counts, all of which are suggestive of the immune system of the patient as a central target to determine disease progression, therapy, and possibly, prevention.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19454, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another biomarker that has been extensively studied is D-dimer which is a degradation product of crosslinked fibrin resulting from plasmin cleavage. Several independent studies from Wuhan, China, have shown that elevated levels of D-dimer in COVID-19 patients are associated with higher mortality. Indeed, it has been used as a prognostic biomarker to predict mortality rates in patients with COVID-19. However, since it is a product of cross-linked fibrin there are many other common conditions in which it can be elevated and, consequently, use of this biomarker warrants caution. The most common substances resulting in analytical interference with D-dimer levels are paraproteins, bilirubin, lipids, and hemolysis. As such, establishing a fold-change cutoff specific for the patient for this prognostic biomarker before drawing conclusions is essential. Interestingly, our resource suggests the use of other biomarkers from similar biological processes, though these have been studied less extensively. These include VWF and antithrombin, among others. VWF, made within endothelial cells, helps platelets stick together, assists clot formation, and transports coagulation factor VIII to areas of clot formation. High levels of VWF have been linked to potential efficacy of COVID-19 treatment and have also been used as a prognostic biomarker for endothelial damage. Escher et al. observed an approximate 500% increase in VWF and coagulation factor VIII expression in COVID-19 patients during later stages of stay in an intensive care unit (ICU). This increase was observed in patients that registered an increase in D-dimer expression in the earlier stages of their stay in the ICU. These patients underwent extensive endothelial stimulation and damage, which can be explained by the presence of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, on the surface of endothelial cells. Similarly, antithrombin, a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in controlling coagulation, was also proposed as a biomarker by at least 2 independent studies.

Cit-H3 plays an important role in neutrophil release of nuclear chromatin, also called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which have been associated with tumor progression in colon cancer. Notably, NETs have also been proposed as a biomarker for SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients and is known to play a role in thrombosis, thereby strengthening our observation that specific biological processes are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE2 that serves as a receptor for the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, shows stabilized protein levels in colorectal and renal cancers, and has also been proposed to be used as a biomarker.
