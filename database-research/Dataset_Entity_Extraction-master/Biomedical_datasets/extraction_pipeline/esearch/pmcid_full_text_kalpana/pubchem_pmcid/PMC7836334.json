They belong to the genus Coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. All the species of CoVs are bifurcated in to 3 major groups based on their genome sequences and serological reactions. Different CoVs have potency to infect humans while other are specific to infect animals and cause variety of highly prevalent and severe diseases. For instance, strains of human coronavirus (HCoV) responsible for respiratory tract infections with different severity include 229E (HCoV-229E), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), OC43 (HCoVOC43), and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1). They create respiratory complications such as common colds, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Well identified animal CoVs are Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Turkey Coronavirus (TCV), Porcine Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV), Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus (HEV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) And Bovine Coronavirus (BCV). Cross infectivity of these viruses to other animals is rare. However, the outbreak of SARS-CoV in the year 2002 was unique in sense the virus's true host was Bat and instead cross infected humans leading to higher mortality than that of HCoVs. Another similar case there MERS-CoV infected humans in the year 2005 was known to have Camel as its native host. Such cross infectivity caused by CoV has prompted a new health alert. Recently COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 is the most severe outbreaks caused by Corona viruses and again, its origin is thought to be from Bats and the virus causing this pandemic condition has very high similarity with previous 2002 SARS-CoV and hence is named SARS-CoV2 Strategies to control CoVs, there are two main ventures (i) discover inhibitors to block virus entry into the host cells, and (ii) discover bioactive compounds that prevent viral replication and transcription. In total of twelve proteins that are identified as a target to control CoVs, Mpro is identified as one of the most vital targets due to its pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription. The Mpro is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (~33\u00a0kDa) and is termed the Main protease because of its dominant role in processing replicase polyproteins and genes. The first Mpro structure to be solved was that of TGEV at 1.96\u00a0\u00c5 in the year 2002.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30190, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Due to the high degree of similarity with amongst the Mpro's of different CoVs, the inhibitor designed previously for MERS or SARS can also work effectively against SARS-CoV-2. An inhibitor named N2 previously designed to inhibit Mpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 and showed promising results. The Mpro of SARS-CoV2 is in fact co-crystalized with N3 and is deposited in PDB (ID: 6LU7). For this reason, under present study, N3 was taken as a positive control to access potency of other inhibitors using computational approach. Moreover, the structure of N3 was artistically developed by CADD approach. Other compounds that are previously designed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include, Hesperetin, Calmidazolium, Cinanserin, Aza-peptide epoxides, FL-166, 8c, 2a and 4o. For short discovery of inhibitors for Mpro of SARS-CoV-2, these previously identified compounds can also be tested. Recently the efforts are been made to construct efficient inhibitors using CADD. For rapid commercialization of drug to inhibit SARS-CoV2 targets, the possible approach is to identify bioactive compounds already approved by FDA using computational approach of docking and molecular dynamics. Such approach was recently perused by Arya et al. where that proposed Procainamide, Tetrahydrozoline, Levamisole to interfere the action of papain-like protease of SARS-CoV2. Thus, molecular docking and molecular dynamics can successfully provide insights to the potency of drugs towards the targets of SARS-CoV2 with relative accuracy and in short duration of time. Here we have therefore used the same approach to identify bioactive compounds from fungal origin that involved the use of docking followed by molecular dynamics. The group of scientists who co-crystalized this protein with N3 also suggests strong covalent bond formed between Cys145 of Mpro with N3 of 1.8\u00a0\u00c5 length making the interaction with of this inhibitor bind irreversibly with the protein. However, when we performed the docking, we cannot make the deduction as docking doesn't provide such information on covalent bond formation. In past Chloropyridine was known to show moderate interaction with Mpro of previously identified SARS-CoV. There are several efforts made to find inhibitors of other corona viruses that have known to causef threat to humans in past, but there limited experiments performed to identify one for SARS-CoV2. ADMET analysis suggested that, LD50 levels of Pyranonigrin A to be much lower than N3, the possible reason could be the larger size of N3 and its peptide like properties. However, the toxicity of 1.979\u00a0mol/kg of Pyranonigrin A is accepted in the medical community and is found to be like several drugs. The classic example would be penicillin, exhibiting LD50 toxicity of 1.8\u00a0mol/kg. (https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00417).
