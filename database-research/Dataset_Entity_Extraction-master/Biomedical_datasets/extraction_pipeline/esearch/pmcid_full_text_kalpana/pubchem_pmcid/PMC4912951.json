In this study, we used a chemical-genetic strategy to determine whether a potent and highly selective inhibitor of PKC\u03b5 catalytic activity reduces ethanol consumption. We generated ATP analog-specific PKC\u03b5 (AS-PKC\u03b5) knock-in mice harboring a point mutation in the ATP binding site of PKC\u03b5 that renders the mutant kinase highly sensitive to inhibition by 1-tert-butyl-3-naphthalen-1-ylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (1-NA-PP1). Systemically administered 1-NA-PP1 readily crossed the blood brain barrier and inhibited PKC\u03b5-mediated phosphorylation. 1-NA-PP1 reversibly reduced ethanol consumption by AS-PKC\u03b5 mice but not by wild type mice lacking the AS-PKC\u03b5 mutation.

Previous studies found that Prkce\u2212/\u2212 mice drink substantially less ethanol than wild type mice and show heightened aversion to ethanol, possibly because of impaired acute functional tolerance to its ataxic and hypnotic effects. These behaviors do not result from developmental changes since inducible transgenic expression of PKC\u03b5 in the amygdala and striatum restores normal sensitivity to intoxication and increases drinking in Prkce\u2212/\u2212 mice to levels observed in wild type mice. Moreover, knockdown of PKC\u03b5 in the amygdala by RNA interference or inhibition by a peptide designed to block translocation of activated PKC\u03b5 reduces ethanol consumption in adult wild type mice. PKC\u03b5 may modulate ethanol intoxication and consumption through phosphorylation of at least 2 substrates: GABAA \u03b32 subunits at Ser-327 and the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor at Ser-460 and Thr-461. However, all of the evidence implicating PKC\u03b5 in behavioral responses to ethanol is derived entirely from genetic or shRNA-mediated reductions in PKC\u03b5 expression or use of a peptide translocation inhibitor. The effect of selective, pharmacological inhibition of PKC\u03b5 kinase activity with a small molecule inhibitor has not been tested.

To circumvent this problem, we have used a chemical-genetic approach to study kinase inhibition by selective, cell-permeable, small molecule inhibitors. The strategy targets the ATP-binding pocket conserved in all kinases, replacing a bulky gatekeeper residue with an alanine or glycine to generate mutant alleles that can utilize ATP analogs in addition to ATP, and that are uniquely sensitive to novel kinase inhibitors, such as analogs of PP1. We have generated such an ATP analog-sensitive PKC\u03b5 (AS-PKC\u03b5) carrying the mutation M486A and have used it successfully to probe PKC\u03b5 function in cell lines. Here, we report the generation of an AS-PKC\u03b5 knock-in mouse to examine the effects of PKC\u03b5 on behavior. Using the AS-kinase inhibitor 1-Naphthyl-PP1 (1-NA-PP1) and AS-PKC\u03b5 mice, we found that selective inhibition of AS-PKC\u03b5 prolongs the ataxic and hypnotic effects of ethanol and reduces ethanol consumption.

The M486A mutation was introduced into the 5' arm by site-directed mutagenesis. The final vector was confirmed by restriction digestion and end sequencing analysis, and then linearized and electroporated into C57BL/6 ES cells. Approximately 192 ES clones that survived selection were screened using a 5' external probe and 4 clones were expanded. Southern analysis of the ES cell DNA using 5' external, 3' external and neo cassette probes identified three correctly aligned clones with a single neo insertion. Two were transfected with Cre recombinase and one was confirmed to be neo deleted by PCR. Presence of the mutation in that clone was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. These ES cells were injected into tyrosinase deficient blastocysts and transplanted into pseudo-pregnant mice. Germ line transmission of the mutation from chimeras was confirmed by PCR using the following primers; CAGCACGGAGTGATCTACAGGTATTCTC (forward primer) and CGGACACAAACAGCAGGTCAAATCT (reverse primer).

Therefore, to determine if inhibiting PKC\u03b5 alters ethanol intoxication, and to test whether oral administration of 1-NA-PP1 was effective in producing a phenotype, we fed AS-PKC\u03b5 mice 1-NA-PP1 or control food and water for 11 days. On average, mice in the 1-NA-PP1 group consumed 3.00 \u00b1 0.14g of 1-NA-PP1 food pellets/day, which was less than the amount consumed by the control group (3.65 \u00b1 0.16g/day; P = 0.02). Mice in the 1-NA-PP1 group also consumed less water (2.00 \u00b1 0.01ml) than mice in the control group (3.5 \u00b1 0.25ml of control liquid /day; P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, despite these differences in food and water intake, body weights were similar in 1-NA-PP1-fed (25.5 \u00b1 0.18g) and control-fed (25.8 \u00b1 0.23g) animals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20507, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Three days after the start of the feeding protocol, mice were tested for ethanol-induced ataxia (Fig. 6A). 1-NA-PP1 impaired recovery from ataxia induced by 1.5g/kg ethanol [FTime(6, 132) = 84.60, P < 0.0001; FDrug(1, 22) = 5.572, P = 0.0275; FTime\u00d7Drug(6, 132) = 1.618, P = 0.147].

We generated a novel AS-PKC\u03b5 mouse line harboring a point mutation in the ATP binding site rendering it highly sensitive to inhibition by nanomolar concentrations of the PP1 analog 1-NA-PP1. Systemically administered 1-NA-PP1 crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached high enough concentrations in the brain to inhibit AS-PKC\u03b5. 1-NA-PP1 prolonged the ataxic and hypnotic effects of ethanol and reduced ethanol consumption by AS-PKC\u03b5 mice.

We had previously found that GABAA \u03b32-S(P)327 immunoreactivity is reduced by 60 \u00b16% in the frontal cortex of Prkce\u2212/\u2212 mice, and phosphatase treatment did not further reduce this residual immunoreactivity, indicating that the antibody also detects dephosphorylated protein. Therefore, a 60% reduction in GABAA \u03b32-S(P)327 immunoreactivity represents 100% reduction in phosphorylation at this site. Based on these results, we conclude that intraperitoneal administration of 25mg/kg 1-NA-PP1 reduced PKC\u03b5-mediated phosphorylation of GABAA \u03b32 in AS-PKC\u03b5 mice by approximately 50%.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24071, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "1-NA-PP1 reduced ethanol consumption in a reversible manner, without significantly reducing alcohol preference at either of the doses tested.

Saccharin, but not quinine consumption, was significantly reduced at the 30mg/kg dose of 1-NA-PP1. This result is different from what was observed in Prkce\u2212/\u2212 mice, which showed no deficit in saccharin consumption.

We have identified two substrates of PKC\u03b5 that could contribute to decreased GABAA receptor function: the GABAA \u03b32 subunit, which when phosphorylated at S327 shows a reduced response to the positive allosteric effects of benzodiazepines and ethanol, and the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor, which when phosphorylated at S460 and T461 reduces the number of cell surface GABAA receptors. It is likely that additional PKC\u03b5 substrates play a role in regulating GABAA receptor function and behavioral responses to ethanol. The M486A mutation allows AS-PKC\u03b5 to use bulky ATP analogs such as N6-benzyl-ATP as phosphate donors, while native kinases cannot use such ATP analogs. ATP analogs with a thiophosphate at the \u03b3-phosphate position can generate a kinase-transferable tag, allowing use of a covalent capture-and-release method to purify tagged peptides from digests of protein mixtures. Mass spectrometric analysis of these peptides reveals the identity of the corresponding proteins and the location of the phosphorylation sites.
