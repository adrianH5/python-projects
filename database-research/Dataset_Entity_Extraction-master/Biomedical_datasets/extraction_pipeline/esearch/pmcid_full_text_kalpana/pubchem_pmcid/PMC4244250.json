CHARMMing also has robust and interactive visualization capabilities, provided by the GLmol and JSmol software packages. One of the features that differentiate CHARMMing from other tools is its support for multiscale calculations using both classical and quantum methods; a graphical setup utility for multiscale calculations is available.

A major part of computational design and discovery efforts, is focused on developing Structure Activity Relationships (SAR) and Quantitative SAR (QSAR) models. SAR and QSAR models are used to predict biological activity of a molecule based on its chemical structure. This area of computational chemistry has been traditionally used as a lead optimization approach in drug discovery research to improve certain features such as probability of activity, drug-likeness, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. Specifically, SAR and QSAR allow compounds that lack desirable or possess undesirable characteristics to be excluded from larger sets before investing time in preparing, analyzing, and testing them. Thus, (Q)SAR procedures reduce costs of the early drug discovery pipeline and have a long history of use both for the industrial design and regulatory assessment of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other chemicals. Further, (Q)SAR models can also be used to reduce the number of animal tests, and thus are applied in industry, where \u2018non-animal alternatives\u2019 are being actively sought. In recent years, (Q)SAR modeling has found broader application in virtual screening as well as in the area of chemical risk assessment. However, the quality of (Q)SAR predictions currently lags behind those of the other areas of machine learning applications, and thus there is a certain room for improvement within this field of cheminformatics.
