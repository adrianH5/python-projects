Toxins are already used, e.g. in medicine, but there is still an increasing number of toxic compounds, representing a tremendous potential to extract new substances. Since predictive toxicology gains in importance, the careful and extensive investigation of known toxins is the basis to assess the properties of unknown substances. In order to achieve this aim, we have collected toxic compounds from literature and web sources in the database SuperToxic. The current version of this database compiles about 60 000 compounds and their structures. These molecules are classified according to their toxicity, based on more than 2 million measurements. The SuperToxic database provides a variety of search options like name, CASRN, molecular weight and measured values of toxicity. With the aid of implemented similarity searches, information about possible biological interactions can be gained. Furthermore, connections to the Protein Data Bank, UniProt and the KEGG database are available, to allow the identification of targets and those pathways, the searched compounds are involved in.

While certain toxins affect many types of cell lines, some toxic compounds only interfere with defined cell types leading to a specific toxicity. Cytostatic drugs, which are often used in chemotherapy, affect the cell cycle or the DNA replication mechanisms and are therefore toxic to all living cells, although tumorigenic cells are more influenced due to their high rate of cell proliferation. In contrast, omeprazole, a drug for the treatment of gastric or duodenal ulcer, only affects cells in the stomach, as it needs an acidic environment to become active. Since it is of great interest to figure out, whether a compound interacts specifically with particular cells, SuperToxic is a distinguished tool for the search of such information. Additionally, the toxicity of an unknown substance can be estimated by comparison with structurally similar compounds with known toxicity. Another application of this database is the estimation of health hazards for a variety of chemicals, especially with respect to the new European chemical management system REACH (registration, evaluation, authorization of chemicals), a regulation for the registration, evaluation and confinement of chemicals. This regulation is necessary, as in many chemical production processes, for example, fabrication of colors, varnishes or leather, the usage of toxic compounds is almost inevitable. Therefore, it is essential to assess potential hazardous effects, to safeguard such substances during transportation, usage and storage. The vast usage of chemicals and new chemical registration programs, like REACH, demands alternatives to experimental validation. All producers or importers, who introduce more than one ton per annum of a substance to the European Union, must evaluate the chemical regarding its toxicity, according to REACH. In order to reduce cost-intensive animal testing of toxic compounds, the promotion of data exchange and predictive toxicology gains importance and acceptance. There are several theoretical approaches, besides QSAR (quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship), which describe the relationship between toxicity and physicochemical properties of compounds.
