Many manually curated databases have been developed to index point mutations but they are not sustainable with the ever-increasing volume of scientific literature. There have been considerable efforts in the automatic extraction of mutation specific information from raw text involving use of various text-mining approaches. However, one of the key problems is to link these mutations with its associated protein and to present this data in such a way that researchers can immediately contextualize it within a structurally related family of proteins. To aid this process, we have developed an application called MutationMapper. Point mutations are extracted from abstracts and are validated against protein sequences in Uniprot as far as possible. Our methodology differs in a fundamental way from the usual text-mining approach. Rather than start with abstracts, we start with protein sequences, which facilitates greatly the process of validating a potential point mutation identified in an abstract. The results are displayed as mutations mapped on to the protein sequence or a multiple sequence alignment. The latter enables one to readily pick up mutations performed at equivalent positions in related proteins. We demonstrate the use of MutationMapper against several examples including a single sequence and multiple sequence alignments.

As such it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for researchers to keep up to date with the literature that may be relevant, either directly or indirectly, to their particular area of research. In order to address these issues, much effort has gone into the development of text-mining methodologies to facilitate the extraction of data directly from the literature. Such methods have the potential not only to aid researchers keep pace with the literature but also to discover novel relationships between aspects of proteins that may be important.

In addition to mutations found/made for a particular protein, there is much greater potential for scientific discovery if one can utilize information about mutations found at similar positions from related proteins (however that may be defined).

The alternatives to automatic retrieval are manually curated systems such as PMD, but this requires huge effort that is probably not sustainable in the longer term. Several algorithms have been developed to extract point mutations from the literature but the challenge is to relate the mutation to the associated protein. To that end we have developed an application called MutationMapper that uses an integrated pipeline to extract point mutations from published text and map them on to the associated protein. The process of identifying a particular protein in the literature is a non-trivial task because there is no standard way of naming them. The most common approach utilized in workflows in text-mining applications is to search through a large amount of text-based data.

Out of the 435 mutations, we were able to map 125 mutations. Thus, 310 were not mapped. There were 121 true positives (i.e. mutations mapped back to the correct protein) and it mapped all the true positives with 100% recall. All the non-mapped mutations were true negatives, as they were not reported on PTEN_HUMAN, but for other proteins or other factors (see below). The false positives (four in total) were mutations mapped on the wrong protein. We had no false negatives. There was an accuracy of 99% and an F-measure of 98.3%. The number of true negatives was high and this reflects a number of issues surrounding the identification of mutations from abstracts: 1) A large proportion were gene mutations rather than protein mutations (e.g. PubMed ID (PMID) 19665071 where a gene has a \u201cpoint mutation in exon 5 (A536G)\u201d, PMID 16009891 which has a \u201cmajor pathogenic effect at mRNA level for the mutant C1366T\u201d and PMID 11597326 which has \u201can intronic variant of p53\u2013G13964C\u201d); 2) some were on another protein that was not the subject of the query. For example, PMID 16160475, where \u201csix different beta-catenin mutations were found in 7 of 13 cases (54%) (G34E, G34V, S33C, D32Y, S33F, D32A) however, no mutations of the PTEN or K-ras genes were identified\u201d. In this example the mutation was performed on beta-catenin and not PTEN even though the sequence being queried against was the human PTEN sequence; 3) some were the names of cell lines. For example, \u201cT47D cells\u201d or \u201chuman glioblastoma cell line T98G\u201d and 4) in some cases there was no specific protein mentioned. Similar performance was observed for other test cases (data not shown). In the context of our methodology presented here, these true-negatives are not a particular problem as we are able to trap them, but it does highlight the difficulty in being able to reliably identify genuine mutations with text-mining alone. In fact this exemplifies the key challenge because mutations are often not described in accordance with any standard nomenclature. For example, Wei et al. recently reported that less than 25% of mutations in their corpus of abstracts used to evaluate tmVar were reported using standard nomenclature. These authors also reported similar problems to those identified above and others including the identification of missense mutations such as V125X. Another example we identified is where standard mutation nomenclature is appended by some other text such as \u201cY1472F-KI\u201d, where the KI means \u201cknock in\u201d mice.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15065, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The use of a short-hand nomenclature based on motifs is quite common in the literature and creates difficulties for a solution that attempts to be generic. Typically, authors then refer to a position in a specific motif. For example, in NMDA receptors there is an invariant SYTANLAAF motif that has been investigated by mutational analysis. For convenience, these positions are sometimes referred to by their position with respect to the first S of this motif, so a mutation of the second tyrosine to phenylalanine might be described as Y2F (e.g. PMID 22891278) rather than the full-length or mature protein numbering. In fact this problem is possibly more widespread than first thought; a similar \u201cshorthand\u201d numbering scheme has been used previously in the cys-loop family of receptors to describe positions along the pore-lining M2 helices (see for example PMID 15213309). As well as those cited above, a further example would be the G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) where the so-called Ballesteros and Weinstein numbering scheme is commonly used rather than the position in the full length of mature sequences.

The retrieval of full-text presents additional problems, not least of which is the availability of that text online. Nevertheless, we were interested to see to what extent the inclusion of full text articles would have on the performance of MutationMapper. Thus, we retrieved as many full-text articles pertaining to ionotropic glutamate receptors as our institutional access allowed. Out of 3170 articles retrieved, 1511 mutations were reported in 376 articles, 579 were single-mapped whereas 405 were multi-mapped. However we found that the performance in terms of accuracy was substantially reduced (as assessed by manual inspection). The reduction in accuracy was rather unexpected. However, on manual reading of the extracted texts there appears to be more scope for ambiguity. Another potential problem is when mutations are referred to in figure legends, which tend to be written as briefly as possible, making association with the correct protein difficult. An even worse scenario is when mutations are referred to within figures (e.g. Mejias et al.), which is almost impossible to accurately extract and map back to effectively.

The novel aspect of this pipeline is that it allows mutations to be analyzed in the context of a sequence alignment.

The searches against full-text were less informative than against abstracts only. Searches are likely to improve as textual data becomes more annotated. Although there is progress in this area, this is a separate and complex issue in its own right. Nevertheless, such annotation should improve the prospects for greater accuracy.
