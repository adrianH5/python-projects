While advanced transcriptomics, including single cell transcriptomics, is commonly applied to investigate T-cell subsets to infer T-cell function, post-translational modifications (PTMs), splice variants and other downstream modifications regularly occur and must not be overlooked. Accordingly, quantitative T-cell proteomics is an essential tool in understanding the workings of T-cells in health and disease. Nanoscale liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become a standard technique for quantitative proteomic studies in human biology and disease, by which traditional data dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics has added significant understanding to the immunological process. The stochastic selection of precursor ions has led to large proportion of missing data, which impacts downstream statistical analyses in proteomics annotation, functional interpretation and therapeutic development. To overcome these limitations, data-independent acquisition (DIA-MS) was performed to acquire all ions by dividing ion space. The introduction of the sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH-MS) which is a combination of tandem mass spectrometry performed by quadrupole time-of-flight (QTof) instruments, DIA-MS and a peptide-centric data query method, facilitated the reproducible quantification of proteomes to perform high-throughput analysis of immunological samples.

Detergent removal was performed by the filter aided sample preparation method using 10\u2009mL, 10 KDa Amicon molecular weight cutoff filter tubes (Merk Millipore, USA).
