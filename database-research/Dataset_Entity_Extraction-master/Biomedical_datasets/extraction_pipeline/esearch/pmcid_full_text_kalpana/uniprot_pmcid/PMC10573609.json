The aim of the study was to profile canine EF proteome and investigate correlations between EF protein content and epididymal spermatozoa (ES) motion parameters. Twenty-three male dogs were divided into two groups: good sperm motility (GSM) and poor sperm motility (PSM). The total motility and progressive motility differed significantly (p = 0.031; p < 0.001, respectively) between the GSM group and the PSM group. The semen samples were centrifuged to separate the EF apart from the ES. The canine EF proteins were analyzed using nano-liquid chromatography, which was coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (NanoUPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and bioinformatic tools for the first time. A total of 915 proteins were identified (GSM\u2014506; PSM\u2014409, respectively). UniProt identification resulted in six unique proteins (UPs) in the GSM group of dogs and four UPs in the PSM group. A semi-quantitative analysis showed a higher abundance (p < 0.05) of four differentially expressed proteins in the GSM group (ALB, CRISP2, LCNL1, PTGDS).

As sperm passes through the epididymis, it undergoes a maturation process that is characterized by morphological and physiological modifications necessary to obtain full capacity for fertilization. These modifications comprise changes in the biochemical composition of plasmalemma, including the addition, removal, or transformation of proteins and lipids, as well as final chromatin condensation and the acquisition of functional features, such as progressive motility. This functional epididymal sperm (ES) maturation occurs in response to modifications in the epididymal fluid (EF) microenvironment. The ES surface during transit along the epididymis is directly exposed to an epididymal milieu rich in numerous proteins, which may interact with the sperm in a specific manner. This may have an impact on the functional features of the male reproductive cells.

Moreover, albumins have been shown to regulate the number of bivalent cations and possess antioxidant properties. It could be suggested that the binding of albumins to the ES plasma membrane might play a protective role in sperm motility. It is likely that the albumins, analyzed in the current study, could have a potential effect on the ES motility by another mechanism in which zinc ions might play a significant role. It has been demonstrated that albumins have a strong affinity for zinc ions, thus reducing their concentrations in spermatozoa.
