Yet how the angiogenic capacity to form sprouts is allocated among endothelial cells (ECs) to guarantee the reproducible anatomy of stereotypical vascular beds remains unclear. Here we show that Sema-PlxnD1 signaling, previously implicated in sprout guidance, represses angiogenic potential to ensure the proper abundance and stereotypical distribution of the trunk\u2019s Segmental Arteries (SeAs). We find that Sema-PlxnD1 signaling exerts this effect by antagonizing the pro-angiogenic activity of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Specifically, Sema-PlxnD1 signaling ensures the proper endothelial abundance of soluble flt1 (sflt1), an alternatively spliced form of the VEGF receptor Flt1 encoding a potent secreted decoy.

The first blood vessels assemble de novo via EC coalescence or vasculogenesis. Later, they expand via angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from preexisting ones. In some locales this process is stereotypic and vascular sprouts form with evolutionarily conserved and organ-specific distribution, abundance and shapes. For example, zebrafish SeAs sprout bilaterally from the trunk\u2019s aorta just anterior to each somite boundary (SB; Figure 1A). SeA sprouts contain migratory, proliferative and filopodia-rich arterial angiogenic ECs molecularly distinct from the sedentary \u201cphalanx\u201d ECs remaining in the aorta. Normally, only aortic ECs near SBs acquire angiogenic capacity. It is thought that non-endothelial paracrine VEGF signals promote angiogenic capacity, while Notch-mediated lateral inhibition between ECs antagonizes it. However, the mRNA expression of vegf-a and Notch pathway genes is inconsistent with the distribution of SeA sprouts. vegf-a is not transcribed along SBs, but rather expressed dorsal to the aorta at both the flanking somites\u2019 centers and the hypochord, a midline endodermal cell row. Notch pathway genes are expressed continuously along the aorta or broadly through the body (C.M.G., J.B. and J. T-V., unpublished observations). Hence, other cascades likely modulate VEGF and/or Notch signaling at pre-sprouting stages to enable the stereotypical allocation of angiogenic capacity within the aorta.

Hence, sema3 or plxnD1 inactivation yields similar SeA sprout pathfinding defects in zebrafish and mice. Two observations made in zebrafish make Sema-PlxnD1 signaling a candidate modulator of angiogenic capacity.
