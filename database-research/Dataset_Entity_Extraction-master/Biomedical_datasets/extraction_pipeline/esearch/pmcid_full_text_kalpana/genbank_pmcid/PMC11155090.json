VP1 and VP2 are identical except that VP2 has a shorter N terminus. Parvoviruses infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates and many members are associated with clinical disease such as reproductive failure, respiratory disease, enteritis, panleukopenia, hepatitis, erythrocyte aplasia, immune complex-mediated vasculitis, and cerebellar ataxia. To date, three subfamilies, Parvovirinae, Densovirinae and Hamaparvovirinae, have been proposed in Parvoviridae. Eleven genera have recently been defined in subfamily Parvovirinae by ICTV (https://ictv.global/taxonomy), including Tetraparvovirus. The first Tetraparvovirus ungulate 1 were identified in 2007\u20132008 from domestic cattle from local food markets in Hong Kong, which was named as bovine hokovirus and showed a close relationship to human parvovirus 4 (now named as Tetraparvovirus primate 1), with 62.9\u201363% genomic identities to the human parvovirus 4. Later in 2016 this virus has been reported in apparently healthy domestic yaks (Bos grunniens) from Guansu and Qinghai provinces of China. In addition to the cattle in HongKong and domestic yaks from northwestern China, Tetraparvovirus ungulate 1 was lately detected in 2016 for the first time from asymptomatic and sick steers from Mexico and USA and from cattle in the South of Brazil. Another Tetraparvovirus ungulate 1 strain (OP113956) was identified from Ireland upon BLAST search in GenBank.
