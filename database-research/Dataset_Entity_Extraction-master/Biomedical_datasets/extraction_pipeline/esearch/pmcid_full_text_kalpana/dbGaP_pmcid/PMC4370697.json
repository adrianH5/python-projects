We provide insight into the genetic etiology of this birth defect by performing genome-wide association studies in two species: dogs and humans. In the dog, a genome-wide association study of 7 CL/P cases and 112 controls from the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (NSDTR) breed identified a significantly associated region on canine chromosome 27 (unadjusted p=1.1 x 10-13; adjusted p= 2.2 x 10-3). Further analysis in NSDTR families and additional full sibling cases identified a 1.44 Mb homozygous haplotype (chromosome 27: 9.29 \u2013 10.73 Mb) segregating with a more complex phenotype of cleft lip, cleft palate, and syndactyly (CLPS) in 13 cases. Whole-genome sequencing of 3 CLPS cases and 4 controls at 15X coverage led to the discovery of a frameshift mutation within ADAMTS20 (c.1360_1361delAA (p.Lys453Ilefs*3)), which segregated concordant with the phenotype. In a parallel study in humans, a family-based association analysis (DFAM) of 125 CL/P cases, 420 unaffected relatives, and 392 controls from a Guatemalan cohort, identified a suggestive association (rs10785430; p =2.67 x 10-6) with the same gene, ADAMTS20.

Rates vary dramatically depending on population, with higher rates of CL/P found in Asians, South Americans, and American Indians compared with Caucasians, while populations of African descent are the least often affected. Interestingly, the CL/P birth prevalence differs between genders (males more often affected), but the CP prevalence does not.

To identify additional craniofacial defects, micro computed tomography (microCT) analysis was performed on two severely affected NSDTR cases with bilateral complete CL and CP and three NSDTR controls. MicroCT findings were consistent with the presence of bone and soft tissue clefts of the primary and the secondary palate (Fig. 2D-G). In both affected individuals, bilateral dentoalveolar clefting was evident between the incisors and canine teeth. This clefting was associated with a complete absence of ossification of the dorsal and lateral aspects of the premaxilla, which would normally form a suture with the maxillae and rostral aspect of the nasal bones. The ventromedial component of the premaxilla, from which the incisors arise, appeared largely normal. However, in contrast, to the controls in which the six incisors are evident in the premaxilla, the affected individuals presented with only four incisors in the remnant premaxillary bone. The lateral-most incisors were not integrated in bone and were relatively poorly formed and abnormally oriented in the cleft individuals. Interestingly, the nasal bones were normal in appearance and length. Compared to controls, the rostral portion of each maxillae was hypoplastic (S1 Fig and S2 Fig.). In one of the two individuals, a cleft of the secondary palate extending the full length of maxillary and palatine bones was observed, resulting in free communication between the nasal cavity and oral cavity. In the second individual, one palatal shelf had extended to the midline and had approximated with the anterior nasal septum while the other showed little lateral outgrowth, although the palatal rugae were still evident on both shelves. This asymmetry in shelf growth was mirrored by the asymmetric palatal bone growth. In contrast to the palate, the basisphenoid and basioccipital bones of the cranial base were similar in appearance to that of controls. Of note, however, both affected individuals had smaller (average ~20% smaller relative to skull length) and more laterally positioned tympanic rings compared to the unaffected individuals (Fig. 2FG). In one individual, the tympanic rings were also slightly dimorphic. In one individual there was notable asymmetry in length of one of the component hyoid bones.

ADAMTS proteins share identical N-terminal domains (e.g. metalloprotease), but the type and number of C-terminal ancillary domains vary. These ancillary domains are critical for activity, inhibition, tissue localization, and substrate specificity. Work on ADAMTS13 demonstrated that point mutations do not consistently function as null alleles and deletion of different ancillary domains in ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS13 resulted in mutant constructs that retained partial function depending on the specific domains that were deleted. Point mutations have been described in four bt alleles (bt\u2014c.1598C>T p.Pro533Leu; bt 9J\u2014c.2451C>T p.Leu761Phe; bt Bei1\u2014c.2860C>T p.Arg954Ter; bt Mri1\u2014c.4073A>C p.His1357Pro), which are located downstream of the catalytic metalloprotease domain. In comparison, the deletion identified in CLPS NSDTRs (c.1360_1361delAA (p.Lys453Ilefs*3)) is closer to the N terminus and within the catalytic metalloprotease domain (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the allele commonly used to study the bt phenotype (bt Bei1) is a nonsense mutation that truncates 471 amino acids or 33% of the full-length protein (Fig. 3B). In ADAMTS13, truncation after the spacer domain (a mutation similar to the nonsense bt Bei1 allele) results in a metalloprotease that is still active. The mutation identified in CLPS NSDTRs truncates 1461 amino acids or 76% of full-length protein and may explain the higher penetrance of craniofacial defects and syndactyly observed in CLPS NSDTRs. In summary, this mutation could be the result of a more severe hypomorph than bt, a null, or a species difference. It is also interesting to note that the CLPS NSDTRs do not appear to have the white spotting pattern that is characteristic of the bt mice.
