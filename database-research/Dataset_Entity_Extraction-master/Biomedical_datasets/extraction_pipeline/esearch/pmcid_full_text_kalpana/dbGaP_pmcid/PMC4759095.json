The objective of this paper is to evaluate associations between CNVs in differentially brain expressed (DBE) genes or genes previously implicated in ASD/intellectual disability (ASD/ID) and specific sub-phenotypes of ASD. The sample consisted of 1590 cases of European ancestry from the Autism Genome Project (AGP) with a diagnosis of an ASD and at least one rare CNV impacting any gene and a core set of phenotypic measures, including symptom severity, language impairments, seizures, gait disturbances, intelligence quotient (IQ) and adaptive function, as well as paternal and maternal age. Classification analyses using a non-parametric recursive partitioning method (random forests) were employed to define sets of phenotypic characteristics that best classify the CNV-defined groups. There was substantial variation in the classification accuracy of the two sets of genes. The best variables for classification were verbal IQ for the ASD/ID genes, paternal age at birth for the DBE genes and adaptive function for de novo CNVs. CNVs in the ASD/ID list were primarily associated with communication and language domains, whereas CNVs in DBE genes were related to broader manifestations of adaptive function. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between sub-phenotypes and CNVs genome-wide in ASD.

Identification of specific components of the ASD phenotype or its correlates that are associated with CNVs could provide etiologic clues to the development of the ASD phenotype. There is growing evidence that certain recurrent CNVs, while predisposing toward ASD, also influence broader phenotypic manifestations, such as intellectual disability (ID), physical characteristics and seizures. This suggests that the impact of CNVs might extend beyond the current clinical diagnostic entities in neuropsychiatry, as demonstrated by the wide range of manifestations of well-characterized genetic disorders, such as the 22q deletion syndrome. Some CNVs might also act as modifiers or vulnerability factors for these phenotypes rather than influencing specific disease outcomes. Since multiple genes can be disrupted by a single CNV, one might expect greater evidence of syndromal presentations that transcend standard clinical features of the specific disorder with multi-systemic effects. To date, most of the CNV research in ASD has focused on disorder-specific CNV identification, and few studies have systematically examined the impact of CNVs genome-wide on specific features, comorbid conditions or clinical correlates of ASD.

They also serve as a data reduction strategy, where the \u2018important' variables can be selected for additional analyses. Random forests can be used when there are missing data, with both continuous and categorical data, with non-Normal data, in the presence of interactions, and do not require reduction of the predictor space before classification. Briefly, a classification tree is constructed by choosing an initial splitting variable (here, CNV carrier status) to determine the optimal splits of the data based on the randomly selected predictor variables (here, clinical phenotype variables). A collection of each of these trees is termed a forest. Here, a random forest analysis using the DOS command line version of the Willows software package was used to investigate the phenotypic differences between cases with and without CNVs impacting ASD/ID or DBE genes. Forests were created from 10\u2009000 trees with a minimum terminal node size (smallest group of cases when the tree construction terminates) of 10 (0 terminal node size in the de novo analyses due to the rarity of de novo events). The number of variables chosen to split a node was selected by the program automatically (here it was four). Results presented here are the variable importance measure, an assessment of which variable is the best classifier of the data, and an out-of-bag (OOB) error measure. When constructing a tree, one-third of the cases are held out to test the tree; these are the OOB samples. Once the tree is constructed, the OOB sample is dropped through the tree, and each case is classified. The proportion of cases correctly classified is the accuracy, and 1 minus the accuracy is the error. The variable importance score is calculated by comparing classification accuracy when the case status in the original and OOB samples is randomly shuffled and then run through the tree. If the error rates do not increase when the cases status is permuted, then the variable under examination is not a useful predictor of case status. This accuracy is averaged over all of the trees in the forest, and the overall classification accuracy of the forest is reflected by the reported OOB error. For reference, no variable importance score has a particular meaning; instead it is a relative ranking of the examined predictors. Therefore, the variable importance scores must be interpreted in reference to one another, and should not be compared across studies.

This finding suggests that family type may be an important source of heterogeneity in ASD. Systematic incorporation of family history is necessary to provide a comprehensive depiction of the role of both genetic risk factors and CNVs associated with ASD.

Although chromosomal aberrations are associated with advanced paternal age, a well-documented risk factor for ASD, as well as neurodevelopmental disorders in general, we did not demonstrate an association between paternal age and de novo mutations. Somewhat surprisingly, advanced maternal age was negatively associated with DBE CNVs. However, there is a complex relationship between joint influence of maternal and paternal age on neurodevelopmental disorders. Further support for the univariable associations was illustrated by the classification analyses where paternal age attained the highest classification accuracy for DBE deletions. Whereas maternal age did not have as high classification accuracy as paternal age and some other variables, it still retained relatively high levels of accuracy in a number of the models.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 26488, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study has several limitations including: (1) Lack of consistent collection of sub-phenotypic measures across sites that resulted in a large amount of missing phenotypic data (see Supplementary Materials for details of data completeness on core measures, Supplementary Table S1); (2) Potential bias in the candidate gene lists, due to publication bias or biased candidate gene selection in the samples contributed to the Gene Expression Omnibus, or omissions of important associated variants discovered after 2009; and (3) Potential bias toward continuous variable types, and highly correlated variables in the random forest analyses. In addition, we did not apply correction for multiple comparisons, so the association analysis results should be interpreted with caution. Traditional methods such as Bonferroni or False Discovery Rate are not valid in the context of non-independent CNV types, and a complex correlation structure within the phenotypic variables, which is why we attempted to complete data reduction via LPA and the random forest analyses. To date, no appropriate methods of correction for multiple comparisons for such a complex data structure have been established, and the best method would be replication of the findings in an independent sample. Such efforts are underway. Furthermore, the benefit of the random forest method is its use as a data reduction strategy, thereby reducing the need for multiple comparisons correction.
