These boundaries consist of highly-conserved splice site sequences including intronic and exonic nucleotides.

If this process is not properly defined, transcripts encoding altered amino acid sequences or premature stop codons can be produced. Depending on the location of the premature stop codon, this results in destruction of the mRNA by nonsense- mediated mRNA decay or production of a truncated protein. mRNA degradation, truncated protein expression, abnormal protein sequences and altered isoform ratios can all disrupt cellular functions and cause disease. Alterations in splicing contribute to diseases ranging from autoimmune diseases to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

Left: a mutation in the ESE of an alternative exon disrupts the ESE, leading to lower levels of inclusion.

We downloaded a list of 1182 putative ESE hexamer sequences from\u00a0 and confirmed that constitutive exons in our dataset have a higher ESE density than alternative exons (Figure 7B). Limiting our analysis to highly-included alternative exons, we find that they are still enriched among exons with the fewest ESEs (by comparing constitutive exons against alternative exons with a PSI\u00a0>\u00a090% in at least one tissue, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4; or by comparing constitutive exons in a given tissue against alternative exons with a PSI\u00a0>\u00a090% in that same tissue, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5). These results hold true even if we fine-tune our analysis to include only those exons with very strong or very weak splice sites (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 6). Therefore, one reason why mutations have smaller effects in constitutive exons may be due to enhancer redundancy (Figure 7C). Similarly, exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are enriched among alternative exons although ESSs are not found in alternative exons that are included with a PSI of 90% in at least one tissue (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 7). One possibility that explains this observation is that, while alternative exons included at intermediate levels make frequent use of ESSs to modulate their levels, those with high inclusion levels in some tissues establish their \u2018extreme\u2019 phenotypes (very high inclusion/high skipping) through other mechanisms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45217, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We next compared, across both types of exon, the density of sequences that differ from any one ESE by only one nucleotide substitution (hereafter, \u2018suboptimal ESEs\u2019 \u2013 note that suboptimal ESEs also include ESE sequences that are one substitution away from each other). Alternative exons were enriched among exons with the smallest numbers of suboptimal ESEs, and this is also true after restricting our analysis to highly-included alternative exons (Figure 7D, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 8, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 9). Because suboptimal ESEs are one substitution away from an ESE, a mutation is more likely to create a new ESE sequence in a constitutive exon than in an alternative exon. This suggests two additional hypotheses that could explain why, at the same initial inclusion level, mutations have stronger effects in alternative exons (Figure 7E).

In these studies, enhancers were often identified by deleting or substituting entire exonic domains or by using antisense oligonucleotides to block binding to an entire domain. Moreover, studies reporting strong effects of single-nucleotide changes generally involved in vitro experiments in which the splicing reaction occurs less efficiently compared to in vivo experiments, so the mutated exons were never highly included. Additionally, exons were often sensitized to the effects of perturbations by surrounding these exons with the genomic sequences of less included exons. In agreement with our conclusions, a previous study showed that single and double nucleotide substitutions had little effect on enhancer activity compared with more complex mutations. Highly-included exons have been shown to have a higher density of enhancers when compared with alternative exons, which presumably contributes to their high inclusion levels. However, this does not mean that individual point mutations in these elements will produce large changes in inclusion. Indeed, our results revealed that, at the same inclusion level, mutations have a stronger effect in alternative exons than in constitutive exons (Figure 7).

This is often the case with Alu elements (retrotransposons that make up over 10% of the human genome). When inserted in an antisense orientation, an Alu element contains a number of sequences resembling splice sites (and are therefore cryptic splice sites). Such an Alu element could therefore be thought of as an exon included at 0%. Mutations in these cryptic splice sites have been shown to activate them, resulting in the insertion of a new exon in the mature transcript and causing disease. Other distal intronic mutations have been shown to cause disease using a similar mechanism. For example, a mutation that strengthens a cryptic splice site was shown to activate a silent exon in the CAPN3 gene, resulting in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.
