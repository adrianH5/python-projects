Colectomy is often considered a definitive treatment for UC, however, de novo inflammation of the ileal reservoir (pouchitis) is a common post-surgical complication with prevalence rates ranging from 12% to greater than 50%. Additionally, 10-17% of patients go on to develop a CD-like phenotype which is described as the development of abdominal or perianal fistulas or abscesses, or inflammation of the small bowel proximal to the pouch (afferent limb). IPAA is also the treatment of choice among individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), however, inflammatory complications of the pouch among this group are very rare. Recent genetic studies have shown that among individuals with IPAA, those with polymorphisms in innate immune and bacterial sensing and recognition genes are at an increased risk for inflammatory complications. However, inflammation rarely develops in the absence of fecal flow, suggesting that this genetic predisposition alone does not itself cause inflammation, and that microbial factors may have a critical role.

Previous histological evidence suggesting that subclinical inflammation may be present in individuals with pre-colectomy UC, although not in those with FAP may offer an explanation for this finding. Thus, the observation that individuals classified into the no pouchitis group had microbial characteristics intermediate between those seen in individuals with pouchitis and FAP, may be related to subclinical inflammation present in this group which was not captured by our reporting, but which was reflected in increased CRP levels detected in this group. Also of note is the observation that the CDL group did not demonstrate decreased diversity compared to individuals without pouch inflammation. This may be related to the fact that several individuals with CDL were not experiencing active pouch inflammation at sampling, and that the inflammatory activity detected in this group at the time of pouch endoscopy was more heterogeneous than was that observed in the pouchitis group.

Interestingly, a recent study of healthy subjects showed that  Blautia  was one of the only genera detected in samples from all individuals, suggesting that it is a common component of a healthy gut microbiota. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested that individuals with CD, including those in remission, have decreased levels of Clostridia-related organisms detected. Both  Bacteroides  and  Parabacteroides  were also strongly associated with outcome. These closely related genera have both been previously implicated in pouch inflammation. Decreased levels of  Bacteroides  have also been previously observed in some studies in inflamed UC and CD tissue compared to healthy controls, while other studies have shown increases in this organism to be associated with disease. This further suggests the importance of this organism in bowel inflammation, regardless of host or specific anatomic site. Furthermore,   Bacteroides  species, specifically B. fragilis, have been shown to modulate immune function, stimulating immune tolerance through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2.  Sutterella  was the only genus from the Proteobacteria phylum associated with outcome, and in contrast with previous studies suggesting a potential pathogenic role for this organism in IBD or no association at all, was detected less frequently among inflammatory groups.

This subclinical inflammation has important clinical and experimental implications, and is reflected in our observations illustrating substantial changes between the microbiome of individuals with inflammatory pouch complications compared to those with FAP. More moderate, yet similar alterations occur in the microbiome of individuals with UC when comparing those with and without inflammation. This likely reflects underlying differences in host genetic predisposition in UC patients resulting in specific alterations in the pouch microbiome that characterize the inflammatory phenotypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32317, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While there were no statistical differences in medication use between outcome groups at the time of or immediately prior to pouchoscopy, it is conceivable that medications, particularly antibiotics, may have impacted the tissue associated microbiota. Yet the described genera were detected significantly less frequently among individuals in the inflammatory outcome groups even when individuals who had taken antibiotics in the preceding month or six months were excluded from the analysis. This would suggest that the effect of inflammation on the microbiome supersedes the impact of antibiotic use. Alternatively, if shifts in the microbiome of the pouch precede and possibly induce pouch inflammation, then the use of antibiotics may not result in long term beneficial effects on bacterial composition or lead to a reversion to a \u201chealthy\u201d pouch microbiome as would be suspected by the typically antibiotic responsive nature of pouchitis. This may in turn be responsible for the often recurrent nature of pouchitis following treatment. It is also possible that past antibiotic use (beyond one month prior to procedure) leads to permanent changes to the microbiome which are detectable long after cessation of medications. Studies evaluating the long-term effect of antibiotics on intestinal microbial composition have shown mixed results with some studies showing a relatively quick reversion to a profile similar to the pre-medication state, while others suggest long-term changes, especially with antibiotic use in childhood. Interestingly, antibiotic use in childhood has been associated with an increased risk of CD, suggesting that changes to the microbiota which occur early in life, whether they persist long-term or not, may have a drastic impact on subsequent disease susceptibility. However, as the levels of these genera had recovered to detectable levels in FAP and individuals without pouchitis, despite historic antibiotic use (data not shown), yet remained undetectable in most pouchitis and CDL individuals, we conclude that this decrease was associated with the phenotype rather than medication use.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34441, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, we did not observe differences in the microbial composition of the pouch compared to the afferent limb among patients regardless of the inflammatory status of either site. The anatomical alterations resulting from the IPAA procedure, namely the surgically induced continuity between the pouch and afferent limb, likely promotes similar bacterial community structure between these two locations. Previous studies have documented the occurrence of variability in the microbiome between inflamed and non-inflamed neighbouring sites, although none were consistent across many individuals. This suggests that individual-specific differences in the microbiome may be important in pathology. Further, the absence of evidence for differences between inflamed and uninflamed locations in the same individual suggests that variable host genetics or location-specific gene expression patterns may be of importance in establishing disease location and phenotype. It is also possible that microbial variation results from the inflammatory process itself. In this case, loss of specific organisms may contribute towards propagating disease but not initiate disease processes. Prospective studies are required to evaluate this hypothesis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35680, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Of particular interest, is the observation that the seven individuals who were taking medication for chronically inflamed pouch phenotypes, and who had successfully achieved resolution of their symptoms, did not demonstrate a change in their microbial composition to resemble that of individuals with healthy pouches. While it appears that the samples from individuals with quiescent disease were most similar to those from individuals with pouchitis, it is conceivable that with a larger sample size differences between these groups may have been observed. Additionally, changes at lower taxonomic levels (ie. species), which were undetectable in this experiment could also have been associated with different phenotypes. It is interesting to speculate, however, that perhaps the reason for patients\u2019 continual requirement for medical therapy is their inability to be colonized by the \u2018beneficial organisms\u2019 described by our group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36619, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The majority of associations described in this report suggest that a loss of organism diversity is associated with inflammation. It is possible that individuals with pouch inflammation may undergo a loss of specific anti-inflammatory organisms that have important roles in modulating the immune response. Many of the organisms detected less frequently in the inflammatory groups have been previously shown to have anti-inflammatory potential: members of the Clostridia XIVa group ( Blautia ,  Dorea  and  Moryella ) produce butyrate, a known anti-inflammatory molecule, and  Bacteroides  produce vitamin K, which is associated with decreased levels of serum inflammatory markers (ie TNFa, CD40 etc). Alternatively, the absence of these typically ubiquitous organisms may allow increased colonization of tissue by atypical species. While we did not observe increased prevalence of specific genera in our cohort, it is conceivable that small changes among several groups of organisms may not have been detected. In any event, endogenous gut organisms have the capacity to exert profound effects on the function of the immune system, and play a pivotal role in maintaining gut immune homeostasis. Such changes in immune function may also be reflected by the presence of anti-microbial antibodies in the serum which are also known to be associated with pouch outcomes.

Our previous findings showing that IBD-associated genetic polymorphisms are also important in pouch pathology, in conjunction with this work suggests that like non-surgical IBD, pouch inflammation arises in individuals with inherited genetic predisposition and changes in the tissue associated microbiome. However, the event triggering disease onset remains elusive, and will require large, prospective studies to evaluate.
