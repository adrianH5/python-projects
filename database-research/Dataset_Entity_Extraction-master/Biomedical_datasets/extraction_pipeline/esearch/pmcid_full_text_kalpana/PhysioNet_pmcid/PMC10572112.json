Early diagnosis and reliable clinical assessments are essential for appropriate therapy and improving patients\u2019 quality of life. Keystroke biometrics, which capture unique typing behavior, have shown potential for early PD diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate keystroke biometric parameters from two datasets to identify indicators that can effectively distinguish de novo PD patients from healthy controls. (2) Methods: Data from natural typing tasks in Physionet were analyzed to estimate keystroke biometric parameters. The parameters investigated included alternating-finger tapping (afTap) and standard deviations of interkey latencies (ILSD) and release latencies (RLSD). Sensitivity rates were calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of these parameters. (3) Results: Significant differences were observed in three parameters, namely afTap, ILSD, and RLSD, between de novo PD patients and healthy controls. The sensitivity rates were high, with values of 83%, 88%, and 96% for afTap, ILSD, and RLSD, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed a significantly negative correlation between typing speed and number of words typed with the standard motor assessment for PD, UPDRS-III, in patients with early PD. (4) Conclusions: Simple algorithms utilizing keystroke biometric parameters can serve as effective screening tests in distinguishing de novo PD patients from healthy controls. Moreover, typing speed and number of words typed were identified as reliable tools for assessing clinical statuses in PD patients.

The disease is characterized by a range of manifestations, including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and loss of postural balance, typically resulting from the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. Current pharmacological therapies mainly aim to restore dopaminergic imbalance by using dopamine precursors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, dopaminergic agonists, anticholinergic agents, and other drugs. Levodopa effectively improves motor problems in patients with PD. However, the long-term administration of levodopa can lead to multiple unpredictable problems including dyskinesia, fluctuations in motor responses to levodopa for example, on\u2013off or freezing, and impaired cognition. Furthermore, the use of current antiparkinsonian agents may aggravate the progression of PD. According to these clinical observations, various preclinical and clinical trials are underway for the development of neuroprotective therapy, cell therapy, and anti-inflammatory treatments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2979, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Studies have revealed that non-specific non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, sleep disorders, and depression, may manifest several years or decades before the diagnosis of PD.

Patients with tremor-dominant PD typically exhibit more apparent clinical features and tend to have better outcomes compared to those with the non-tremor subtype. The diagnosis of non-tremor dominant PD can be challenging as the symptoms may not be as obvious as those in the tremor-dominant subtype. Additionally, motor dysfunctions such as rigidity and bradykinesia may not become apparent until the disease has already progressed. These symptoms can also be similar to those seen in other neurological disorders, leading to potential misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and treatment. The misdiagnosis of early PD has been reported to range from 40% to 70%. Early diagnosis and the implementation of appropriate therapeutic strategies can significantly improve patients\u2019 quality of life.

The third part of the UPDRS (UPDRS-III), designed to assess motor functions in PD patients, has been used to determine the severity of PD and track the progression of the disease over time. Given that tremor and locomotor dysfunctions, such as bradykinesia, festinating gait, and trunk imbalance, are the predominant motor manifestations of PD, kinesiological biomarkers such as gait and postural analyses, as well as tremography, are more relevant in a clinical setting than biological markers. With the advancement of wearable and detection devices, both motor and non-motor signs of PD can be accurately assessed using several available devices. Nevertheless, several non-invasive techniques have been studied. However, weaknesses and drawbacks exist, challenging the future applications of these methods. Keystroke biometrics refers to the distinctive typing pattern and rhythm of an individual\u2019s typing behavior. This type of biometric analysis examines keystroke dynamics, such as the timing between keystrokes, the duration of each keystroke, and the pressure applied to each key, to create a unique typing profile. Keystroke biometrics has been utilized for authentication purposes. While keystroke biometrics have primarily found application in the domains of security and user authentication, their utilization in clinical settings is an emerging and relatively novel area of research. As a result, only a limited number of clinical studies have explored this biometric modality for various applications. Some researchers have employed neural networks and sophisticated methods to analyze keystroke biometrics for the early diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease. In 2016, Giancardo and colleagues proposed that keystroke biometrics could provide an early diagnostic indicator for PD. The raw data from their study, including on UPDRS-III scores, typing speeds, the numbers of typed words, and letters typed in a natural typing task are freely available from PhysioNet. In this study, we extracted and assessed these keystroke biometric datasets with the aim of identifying easy-to-use and sensitive indicators for the early diagnosis of PD and relevant parameters for assessing the severity and progression of PD. Our study innovatively applies keystroke biometrics to address critical clinical questions related to the diagnosis, severity assessment, and disease progression tracking of PD. As a result, we aim to introduce a novel, non-invasive, and user-friendly tool for clinicians and researchers in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.

In this study, our objective was to develop an assisting diagnostic tool for the early detection of de novo PD, distinct from previous studies that encompassed patients with either de novo or early PD. Our results, shown in Figure 2a, reveal that the nQi, afTap, SD, ILSD, and RLSD parameters had similar AUC values in differentiating de novo PD patients from the healthy controls. We used maximal Youden\u2019s indices to define cut-off points for each parameter and compared their sensitivity and specificity. nQi and SD had lower sensitivity rates (58% and 42%, respectively) than previously reported, possibly due to our strict grouping method. However, the afTap, ILSD, and RLSD parameters showed higher sensitivity rates (83%, 88%, and 96%, respectively), making them more suitable for screening tests (Table 3). These parameters had lower specificity, but high sensitivity is crucial for a screening test as it helps to identify individuals who may require further diagnostic procedures. Conversely, the AUC values of RLSD and ILSD decreased while the AUC values of nQi and afTap increased when differentiating early PD patients from the healthy controls (Figure 2b). Additionally, the sensitivity of nQi, afTap, and SD increased, but RLSD and ILSD decreased significantly when distinguishing early PD patients from the healthy controls. Conversely, the specificity of these two parameters increased. This change could be attributed to the fact that subjects in the early PD group had been undergoing treatment for several years. Based on these findings, we propose that nQi and afTap are valuable indicators for detecting diagnosed PD.

However, our current study found that the analyzed ILSD and RLSD were more effective than HL in detecting early PD. As per the definitions of keystroke biometric parameters, IL is the time interval between the release of one key and the subsequent press of another key, while RL is the interval between the release time points of two consecutive keystrokes. HL, on the other hand, measures the muscle activity involved in contracting and relaxing during typing. According to Lan\u2019 s speculation, the SD represents the fluctuation of the time intervals. While rigidity and bradykinesia are the primary symptoms of PD, they result in consistently increased muscle tone, such as in cogwheel or lead pipe rigidity, which would not impact the variation within HL. However, HLSD may increase in other neurological conditions that cause inconsistent muscle tone such as spasticity resulting from stroke, dystonia, and dyssynergia in cerebellar disorders. In contrast, IL refers to the time duration between releasing one key and pressing the next key. This motion involves a more intricate motor process including initiation, programming, and executing the movement of the motor machinery. Based on this hypothesis, IL can serve as a more accurate indicator for diagnosing PD compared to HL. Furthermore, in the current typing test, IL can also be influenced by a person\u2019s reading ability and vision, suggesting that IL may be a more sensitive measure than HL in the early diagnosis of PD with cognitive impairment. Additionally, ILSD could potentially serve as a screening tool for cognitive and visual disorders as deviations from normal ILSD values could indicate underlying neurological impairment. The afTap parameter measures consecutive random typing and is simpler than the natural typing task.
