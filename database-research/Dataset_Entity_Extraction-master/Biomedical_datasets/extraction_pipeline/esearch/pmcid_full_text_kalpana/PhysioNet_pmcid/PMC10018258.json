Sharing of health data requires caution due to the sensitivity of the underlying content, and the use of synthetic data has been proposed as an alternative to sharing real-world clinical data. Synthea is one approach for generating synthetic data which adopts a data-free model wherein numerous rules were developed by domain experts in order to generate data similar to that encountered during routine clinical practice. Synthea was used to create SyntheticMass, a FHIR collection of synthetic patients admitted to hospitals in Massachusetts, which has seen broad use in the development and evaluation of FHIR tools. However, synthetic data generated using a data-free model has limited utility in the research context as analyses can only recapitulate known clinical knowledge encoded by domain experts in the generative algorithm. Alternatively, the deidentification of patient data would result in a defacto realistic dataset usable for the generation of new knowledge and algorithms.

An additional common challenge in transforming data into fixed common data models is the need to balance comprehensiveness of the database with ease of use for analysis. Relational database views emerged to support separation of these concerns without harming data integrity. It may be a similar approach is warranted within healthcare wherein the comprehensive FHIR resources, which are unideal for analysis, are used for archival of clinical data.

For example, the MimicProcedure and MimicProcedureICU profiles could be merged which would simplify the representation in FHIR at a cost of obscuring the underlying distinct terminology sets and provenance of the data. The modeling process was particularly challenging for medication, microbiology, and encounter resources. We adopted a request-dispensation-administration framework applicable to a number of healthcare contexts. Challenges involved missing data for one or more of these components due to varying levels of digital sophistication for the department providing care and for the time period during which the patient was admitted. Microbiology data was naturally modeled by multiple resources linking the hierarchical relationships between test, sample, isolate, organism, antibiotic, and susceptibility. Nevertheless, the multiple parent-child relationships resulted in a complex set of resources describing what is ostensibly a single observation.

The FHIR team recommends use of validation in development and not in production for efficiency.

An order of magnitude increase in storage space required is prohibitive for many use cases. Nevertheless, a number of caveats exist for our analysis.

Second, we did not curate any data during our transform, and the database contains a number of biases which occur in data collected during routine clinical practice.
