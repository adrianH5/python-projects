It is important to note that the original electrocardiography model was originally conceived using current measurements (string galvanometer). The original cardiac conduction model was rendered into a voltage model invoking the simplified homogeneous volume conductor hypothesis and the Ohm\u2019s law, when the solid-state electronic amplifier made its debut in this field. For this reason, when considering the unipolar electrodes potentials in Equations (3) and (4) as they are supposedly measured to a common voltage reference this seems to cancel out. Unfortunately, in the case of the human body, where this reference point is directly or indirectly referred to the right leg, and the conductive pathways between exploring electrodes and this connection are not homogenous the cancellation of the reference point may not be perfect. This is particularly true for the WCT where potentials of chest electrodes, already referenced to right leg, are furtherly referenced to an average of electrodes (themselves referenced to the right leg) placed at a different distance from reference. As it is beyond the purpose of this paper to digress into the details of the model and the hardware utilized, we refer the reader to our previously published papers and in particular to of which we adopted the conduction model depicted in Figure 1.
