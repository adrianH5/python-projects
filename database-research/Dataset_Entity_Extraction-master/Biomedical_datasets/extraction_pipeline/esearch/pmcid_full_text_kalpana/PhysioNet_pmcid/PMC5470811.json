Significant differences were obtained in particular in the conditions when uterine contractions and maternal and fetal ectopic beats occurred.

Doppler ultrasound is the traditionally applied technique for monitoring the fetus during pregnancy. It can usually identify and measure embryonic heartbeat by six weeks, while exams performed between 18 and 22 week of gestation allow screening for most fetal cardiac anomalies. In particular, congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital anomaly worldwide, with an incidence estimated at 6\u201312 cases per 1000 live births. Early diagnosis of CHD during pregnancy can increase survival rates of the fetus and decrease long-term morbidity in both ductus-dependent and foramen ovale-dependent CHD. However, the probability of ultrasound to accurately detect CHD ranges from 65% to 81%, with a significant part of events missed. Inaccuracies in ultrasound detection can be due to the complex anatomy of the fetal heart, its movement, small size and mixing maternal and fetal heart rate. Higher detection rates can be achieved using three- and four-dimensional ultrasonography. The disadvantages of these techniques are that they require expert personal and that they are extremely expensive. FMCG can be recorded reliably from the 20th week onward. Compared to ultrasound it has a higher resolution and higher signal quality, allowing an assessment of PQRST complex alterations, and detecting fetal arrhythmia. Early diagnosis of fetal arrhythmia permits an appropriate therapeutic intervention and the reduction of unexplained fetal death in late gestation.

Despite providing a high quality fECG, this technique has consistent drawbacks due to its invasive nature and its limited applicability during labor. Recently, non-invasive fECG recording has received considerable interest in monitoring fetal health. With this modality, signals are recorded by multiple electrodes placed on the abdomen of the mother. Non-invasive fECG has numerous advantages including the safeness, the possibility of long-term continuous monitoring, the wide time-range of applicability (from 18 weeks of gestation) and the relative low cost. On the other hand, several technical challenges prevent a direct usability of the acquired signals. In particular, the fetal signal has low amplitude and is mixed with several sources of noise and interference such as maternal ECG (mECG), baseline drifts, power line, muscle electrical activity (EMG), maternal respiration, motion artefacts and electrode contact noise. These sources of noise often have higher amplitude than the fECG so the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is low. Fetal ECG amplitude can vary depending on several factors of the recording setup. For example, skeletal muscle artifacts introduce high frequency components between 10 Hz and 500 Hz during skeletal muscle activity, in particular during a contraction, masking fECG. In addition, fetal movements can result in a different orientation of the fetal heart vector with respect to the electrode grid, changing the amplitude and morphology of the measured signals. In addition, fECG often overlaps in time and in frequency with mECG and the other noise components so the extraction of fECG from abdominal leads results in a very challenging task. Importantly, it should be noted that between the 28th and 32th weeks of gestation the recording of surface fECG is unfeasible due to the formation of the vernix caseosa, a thin fatty layer which almost electrically shields the fetus. However, for normal pregnancies (non-premature deliveries), the layer slowly dissolves in the 37th to 38th weeks of pregnancy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5679, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For these reasons, different signal-processing methods have been implemented to extract fECG from abdominal mixtures (for a review see). Methods for fECG extraction can be broadly divided into two groups: mECG canceling and blind source separation (BSS). The first group includes the regression-based methods which use the mECG as reference input to estimate and cancel its contribution on abdominal signals. This task can be performed in a continuous way by adaptive filtering (AF) or in a beat-by-beat mode by template subtraction (TS). AF uses maternal reference channels to estimate their projection onto each abdominal signal. TS can be considered as a special case of AF that uses as reference input signal an impulse sequence synchronized with maternal beats. However, TS is usually implemented by first estimating the mean contribution of the maternal cycle (template) and then subtracting it from the mixture of abdominal signals. A powerful method to estimate the contribution of each single maternal heart beat to the abdominal signal is to use a reduced space approximation by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which can be implemented by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6867, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "BSS aims at separating the different components of the abdominal mixture without a priori knowledge of the signal, but according to the statistical properties of the data.

Our first algorithm was developed for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013 (CinC 2013), which promoted the development of accurate and robust algorithms for estimating fHR, fetal interbeat intervals, and fetal QT intervals from multichannel maternal ECG recordings. Further details about the CinC 2013 can be found in, which discussed the background issues, the design of the Challenge, the key achievements, and the follow-up research. This first algorithm that we developed, called the ICA-based method, belongs to the hybrid group of methods, being based on the sequence of ICA, mECG canceling (in particular TS) and a second ICA and obtained the top official scores during event 1 and event 2 concerning fetal heart rate and fetal interbeat intervals estimation section.

This drawback could be ascribed to the model order selection problem. In theory, the number of independent sources is undetermined and always higher than the number of acquired signals, thus ICA method works in a sub-optimal contest and it will be able to separate the independent sources of interest only if their components in the acquired mixed signals have higher power greater than the others. To face this problem, we implemented a second algorithm, the quality index optimization (QIO)-based method, which a priori takes into account specific characteristics of the fECG rather than only the unspecific independence of sources. In this second method, two quality indexes (fQI and mQI) were devised, which discriminate the two components of interest (fECG and mECG, respectively) from noise sources. These indexes were built exploiting the morphological and temporal characteristics of the fECG/mECG signals. An optimization procedure based on the Nelder-Mead algorithm was then applied in order to find a linear combination of abdominal signals, which maximizes these indexes. This method can be considered a novel approach for fECG extraction, which attempt to find the fetal QRS (fQRS) in the abdominal mixture by exploiting its characteristics.

The first one is a method based on ICA, which is a simplification of the method that we presented at the Physionet CinC 2013. Indeed, in the implementation on the FECGSYNDB, with respect to the previous algorithm, we eliminated the second step of ICA as we observed that, on this database, it did not improve the performance (data not shown). The second method is an algorithm based on devising a quality index that is built exploiting the morphological and temporal characteristics of the signal of interest (in this case the fECG) and then finding a linear combination of signals which maximizes this index. It should be noted that all the methods integrate a classical step performing mECG canceling, aimed at removing from the abdominal mixture this undesired component before obtaining the final fECG.

This can be due to the fact that the two methods use different criteria to enhance the fQRS so that one can succeed when the other fails. Indeed, in our previous paper, we have compared the performance of ICA-based and QIO-based methods record-by-record and we observed that, although generally the QIO-based method outperformed ICA-based one, for some records, the opposite was found. Thus, as we have hypothesized, a combination of the two approaches improves the overall performance in fQRS detection.
