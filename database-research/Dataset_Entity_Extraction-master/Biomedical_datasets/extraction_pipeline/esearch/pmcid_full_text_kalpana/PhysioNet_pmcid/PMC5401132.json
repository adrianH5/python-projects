Thus, a pre-processing step is required to reduce both the noise and the data size. At this stage, the abdominal signal is filtered by a band-pass filter to remove low and high frequency noises. In order not to distort the signal and preserve its morphology, a zero phase and flat frequency filter have to be utilized. Given the fact that Butterworth filters provide a maximally flat frequency response with no ripples in the passband, we opt for this class of filters at the pre-processing stage. To select the cutoff frequencies of the filter, one should pay particular attention to challenge a tradeoff between the amount of noise removal and preservation of the frequency contents of fECG. While in pathological cases such as bradycardia and tachycardia FHR lies on the frequency range of 1.3 to 3.3 Hz, movements are primarily reflected as frequencies in the range of 2 to 10 Hz. In this paper, the cutoff frequencies of the band-pass filter are designed at 3 and 80 Hz which turns out to remove the wandering baseline and low frequency noise efficiently preserving the time domain information sufficiently. Next, a notch filter at 50/60 Hz is applied to remove the power line interference and finally, the signals are normalized.

For instance, when fECG is extremely weak so that it is buried in the background noise, applying ICA may be useful. In our scenario, each of four obtained residual fECGs represents a combination of pure fECG and multiple remaining noise and artifacts. After applying ICA to these signals, it is expected that one of the components carry the fECG information. However, sometimes noise or artifacts are not independent of fetal signal. For example, in actual measurements, the motion artifacts and ECG are not exactly independent and cardiac dynamics such as heart rate and ECG morphology are affected by body movements. Hence, the appearing fetal IC may not be the best one. One of the limitations of ICA is that one has to rely on visual inspection of ICA components for further processing. In this paper, a new approach is introduced to solve this problem. Among four signals recovered after ICA, the best signal representing fECG is picked through a selection procedure (explained in 2.2.4).

Since these two\t \tsignals are similar morphologically and the other feature values for mother and fetus may be close to each other, a negative penalty weight (-3) is imposed for heart rates less than 120 and more than 175 bpm.\t \tSince during active pushing of delivery time,\t \tthe mother\u2019s HR may reach 170 bpm, this feature alone may not be reliable enough.\t \tSkewness\tThe fECG signal (like mECG)\t \thas a non-Gaussian distribution. Skewness shows the level of asymmetry of a signal statistically. The absolute value of the skewness for mECG is larger than fECG and\t \tthe fetal skewness value lies in a specific range distinguished from other signals and noises. However, among the fECGs, the one with higher skewness shows better\t \tSNR. As this feature plays a major role in the best fECG selection, a higher weight is attributed to this feature (3). \t \tKurtosis\tECG has typically a\t \tsuper-Gaussian distribution.

For each feature (except FHR), two of the signals with the highest (or lowest in the case of RMS and sample entropy) feature values are assigned a predetermined weight as the flag for that feature, and the rest of the signals receive 0 as flags (Table 1).
