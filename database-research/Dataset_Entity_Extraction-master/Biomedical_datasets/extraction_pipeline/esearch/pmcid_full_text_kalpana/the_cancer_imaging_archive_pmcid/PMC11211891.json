Annually, approximately 230,000 women are diagnosed with EOC, with more than 75\u00a0% of patients being diagnosed at an advanced stage. Furthermore, this disease claims the lives of around 150,000 patients per year worldwide. The standard treatment for EOC involves surgical intervention followed by platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. However, in recent years, advances in immunotherapy and targeted therapy have emerged as promising treatment options. Despite these advances, the average 5-year survival rate for EOC patients remains below 50\u00a0%, especially for those diagnosed at an advanced stage, where the 5-year survival rate is a mere 29\u00a0%. Moreover, the prognosis and survival outcomes vary significantly among individuals, attributed to the considerable heterogeneity observed both among patients and within tumours. The current diagnostic and prognostic indicators of EOC, including clinical and pathological characteristics, serum markers, such as carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), and traditional techniques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are inadequate to meet the clinical demands of precision medicine. Consequently, there is a pressing need to explore novel prognostic indicators that can facilitate the early and effective assessment of patients and support clinical decision-making.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3507, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) protein encoded by the CD38 gene is a non-lineage-restricted type II transmembrane glycoprotein that synthesises and hydrolyses cyclic adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate ribose, serving as an intracellular calcium mobilisation regulator. CD38 is expressed on the surface of various immune cells, promoting immune cell activation, proliferation, and adhesion, as well as exerting certain regulatory effects on tumour development. Studies have found that CD38 is also highly expressed in lymphoid neoplasm cells, especially multiple myeloma (MM), and solid tumour cells, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and prostate cancer. Furthermore, it has been confirmed to be associated with immune cell infiltration and tumour metabolism regulation. Furthermore, Zhu et al. found that CD38 expression in EOC tissues was higher than in normal tissues, and high CD38 expression has been reported to be associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) in EOC patients. The biological associations of CD38 with EOC were also investigated by several studies, revealing that increased CD38 expression is associated with the enrichment of antitumor immune gene signatures in various categories, including immune response, lymphocyte activation, regulation of T cell-mediated immunity, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, among EOC patients. Furthermore, heightened CD38 expression showed a positive correlation with the infiltration of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, such as CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells, in the EOC microenvironment, indicative of a potential contribution to the modulation of antitumor immunity. Therefore, CD38 shows potential as both a biomarker for EOC prognosis and as a therapeutic target. However, the currently available methods for detecting the CD38 protein or messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which include peripheral blood cytokine detection, flow cytometry, ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq), and pathological immunohistochemistry, although mature and accurate, have drawbacks that make them unsuitable for frequent clinical application. These include invasiveness, operational complexity, relatively high costs, and an inability to comprehensively reflect the expression profile of tumour tissues. Therefore, there is a need to develop non-invasive and efficient methods that are able to reflect molecular expression levels in the whole tumour.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5949, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Currently, CT is one of the most commonly used imaging methods for the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of ovarian cancer (OC). CT images are easily accessible and provide valuable information on the morphology of lesions, their surrounding infiltration, and the extent of metastasis. However, traditional imaging methods, such as CT and MRI, rely on visual identification and have limitations in providing comprehensive information. Radiomics, on the other hand, has the potential to overcome these limitations by converting conventional medical image information into high-dimensional data that can be analysed quantitatively. Radiomics provides a wide range of quantitative features based on intensity, shape, volume, and texture, which are closely related to molecular-level characteristics and the tumour microenvironment.

Thirdly, the cases included in our analysis were all of the OSC subtype; therefore, the utility of the constructed model in other EOC subtypes remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the manual delineation of VOIs is subjective, introducing potential biases that can affect subsequent analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct multicentre studies with larger sample sizes. Additionally, incorporating more objective radiomics practice methods, such as automated or semi-automated VOI delineation, could enhance the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30480, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30491, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "High levels of CD38 expression can improve OS in EOC patients.
