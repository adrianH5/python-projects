In the acute COVID-19 group, 17,993 (4.5%) of 395,680 patients were hospitalized. The number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the LC group was much higher (1009/7471, 13.5%). Furthermore, patients with LC were more likely to have had an ICU admission: 261/7471 (3.5%) versus 2523/395,680 (0.6%). Similar findings were reported by O\u2019Connor et al in an observational study of 187 patients with 15% hospitalized and 5.4% admitted to the ICU. The Zoe Symptom Study app reports even higher rates of patients attending the hospital (up to 44% of those experiencing symptoms for more than 56 days) but does not clarify whether these patients were admitted to the hospital. Survey studies such as these may also suffer from selection bias and are not necessarily representative of the wider population. Nevertheless, hospital attendance during the acute infection appears to be a risk factor for LC, and further work is required to address this.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35605, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Strengths and Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35631, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study used the PCSC of the RSC, 1 of Europe\u2019s oldest sentinel systems and one widely involved in pandemic research.

It is also possible that key data were not coded at all but were included in the free-text narrative within EHRs. Our study aimed to compare LC in the hospitalized and nonhospitalized groups. It is possible that these represent 2 separate populations with different symptom clusters. Those hospitalized with acute COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from respiratory and other organ damage, whereas those managed in the community may suffer from a potentially different range of LC symptoms with a lower risk of end-organ damage and mortality.
