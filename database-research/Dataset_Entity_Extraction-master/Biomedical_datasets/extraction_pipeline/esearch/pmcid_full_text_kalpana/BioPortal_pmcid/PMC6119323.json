Children must be different from their parents. It is common to find properties or relationships specific to the parent class not being inherited by the children, as for example in the case of the parent class Subjective visual disturbance, which is described as having possible clinical courses of sudden onset or gradual onset; but the child sudden visual loss has sudden as its only valid onset.

But Campbell et al. asserted that SCT databases have limitations, including reduction of data richness, limitations on the query capability, and increased systems overhead. A database converts the SCT main text-based data files (i.e. concepts, descriptions, and relationships) into three interrelated database tables based on CONCEPT_IDs. As a result, the SCT knowledge base is \u2211\u2009=\u2009(T, A), where T is the schema, and A represents the instances. Structured Query Language (SQL) queries on \u2211 can be used to fetch specific concepts, descriptions, or relationships that are used for medical data encoding, natural language processing, and building a user interface in EHR ecosystems. Regarding intelligence and inference capabilities, databases are weak in making inferences, because databases support queries only based on explicitly stated data instances, and they are based on a closed-world assumption (CWA). CWA assumes that \u2211 contains complete data. Based on \u2211, if a SQL query asking for fact C did not find it explicitly stated, then a clear result will be returned (0 or NULL). This concept is known as negation as failure (NaF) or (NOT TRUE\u2009=\u2009FALSE), or \u2211\u22adC. The resulting database models for SCT cannot be utilized to answer semantic queries, and no reasoner has been used to make inferences from databases. Some studies, such as the one by Schadow et al., implemented the logical model of SCT in relational database format by transitive closure Table (TC), which represents only subsumptive relationships in the form < Ancestor, Descendant>. However, this limited table requires extensive recursive calculations. For example, the TC table for the 2014 SCT exceeds five million rows.

OWA assumes that the \u2211 contains incomplete knowledge, so no existing knowledge means \u201cNOT KNOWN.\u201d For example, if \u2211 does not include knowledge about a patient\u2019s allergy, it is not correct to say that the patient does not suffer from an allergy (i.e. NOT TRUE\u2009=\u2009UNKNOWN). Additional information is required to confirm or refute this hypothesis. A negative answer (i.e. NaF) is returned if the query contradicts other axioms in \u2211. There are many reasoners and tools in the literature to support ontology engineering and semantic reasoning.

For each new release, IHTSDO provides textual release notes and delta files to determine the atomic additions and removals of concepts and relationships.

OGMS extends BFO. Most of the OBO Foundry ontologies are aligned with BFO, which makes BFO the best choice for building the SCT upper-level ontology. One of the main advantages of BFO is its realism-based approach, namely, the view that our thoughts, representations, beliefs, and knowledge are about reality. Thus, an ontology is a representational artifact about the world itself and not concepts. The problem arising from concept-based ontologies is that the term concept is often ambiguous. Taking, for example, SCT itself, we know that concept can refer to 1) the clinical idea (for instance, the concept of kidney disease), 2) the ConceptId (a string, for example, \u201c90,708,001\u201d), and 3) the entity itself in the real world (the instances of kidney disease we actually find in patients\u2019 bodies). Thus, the ambiguity often neglects the use-mention distinction. Resorting to the ontologically realistic perspective of BFO, the ambiguity is resolved: the terms in ontologies refer to universals, which are not concepts or strings, but mind-independent and repeatable features of reality where existence depends on the particulars (the concrete entities) by which they are instantiated. So, when we talk about kidney disease, we are sure we are talking about something in reality (namely, all the instances in the world of the kinds of kidney disease). Thus, we avoid use-mention mistakes, and we avoid incorrect conclusions (for example, that kidney diseases are concepts instead of real things in people\u2019s bodies).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13949, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In order to build the SCT ontology, the SCT international release comes with a Perl transform script that converts the RF2 files into OWL format.

Many authors proposed rules to eliminate redundancy. The redundancy prevention axioms include (1) repeating ungrouped exists-restrictions (\u2203R.C\u2009\u2293\u2009{\u2203R.C\u2009\u2293\u2009\u2009\u2203\u2009S.

D}\u2009\u2293\u2009{\u2203R.C2\u2009\u2293\u2009\u2009\u2203\u2009S. D}\u2009=\u2009{\u2203R.C2\u2009\u2293\u2009\u2009\u2203\u2009S. D} when\u00a0C1\u2009\u2292\u2009C2), and (3) repeating an exists-restriction with more general classes in the same group ({\u2203R.C1\u2009\u2293\u2009\u2009\u2203\u2009R.C2\u2009\u2293\u2009\u2009\u2203\u2009S.

Generally, there are some studies, which tried to enhance the semantics of SCT. However, very few studies have unified its high-level concepts under suitable universals of top-level ontologies, and no studies have implemented the SCT concept model in OWL axioms using these top-level ontologies. Table\u00a06 provides a comparison between these studies according to a set of metrics.

The paper\u2019s main aim is to preserve all information released in SCT files, including concepts, descriptions, and relationships. All possible SCT expressions, including pre-coordinated and post-coordinated expressions, can be implemented using SCTO terminology (classes, object properties, and data properties). The SCTO contains 304 universals (classes and subclasses), 28 properties, 1555 annotations, and 2400 axioms. It is publicly available through BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/SCTO/.

After population, ontology consistency checking will be performed, and the SCTO will be used for semantic queries taken from real healthcare environments.
