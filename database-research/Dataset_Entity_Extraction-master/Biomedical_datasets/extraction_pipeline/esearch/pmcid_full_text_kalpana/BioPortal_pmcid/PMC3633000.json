To help manage these vast and disparate data sources, researchers have turned to the Semantic Web. Specifically, ontologies are used in data annotation, natural language processing, information retrieval, clinical decision support, and data integration tasks. The development of software applications to perform these tasks requires the integration of Web services to incorporate the wide variety of ontologies used in the health care and life sciences. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology, a National Center for Biomedical Computing created under the NIH Roadmap, developed BioPortal, which provides access to one of the largest repositories of biomedical ontologies. The NCBO Web services provide programmtic access to these ontologies and can be grouped into four categories; Ontology, Mapping, Annotation, and Data Access. The Ontology Web services provide access to ontologies, their metadata, ontology versions, downloads, navigation of the class hierarchy (parents, children, siblings) and details of each term. The Mapping Web services provide access to the millions of ontology mappings published in BioPortal. The NCBO Annotator Web service \u201ctags\u201d text automatically with terms from ontologies in BioPortal, and the NCBO Resource Index Web services provides access to an ontology-based index of public, online data resources. The NCBO Widgets package the Ontology Web services for use directly in Web sites.

The BioPortal Web interface allows users to browse the list of ontologies, search and comment on terms in ontologies, annotate text with ontology terms, and search an ontology-based index of biomedical resources. The BioPortal architecture currently includes both LexEVS (http://informatics.mayo.edu/LexGrid) and the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 database (http://protege.stanford.edu), however work is underway to replace the dual database backend with a RDF database.

The Ontology Web services provide access to ontologies, their metadata, ontology versions, navigation of the class hierarchy (parents, children, siblings) and details of each term. These services also allow download of the ontology (in the original format and in RDF), provide the ability to search for terms in an ontology, to extract subsets of an ontology and to provide comments and propose new terms as metadata to the ontology. The Widgets package the functionality of the Ontology Web services in order to provide embeddable code for Web sites. These widgets include a term autocomplete widget and ontology visualization widgets. The Mapping Web services provides access to a variety of mappings published in BioPortal. The mapping data includes mappings from UMLS based on shared Concept Unique Identifiers, mappings specified within ontologies, user submitted mappings, and automatically generated mappings using the Lexical OWL Ontology Matcher (LOOM), which generates mappings based on lexical similarity of the preferred name and synonyms between pairs of ontologies. The Mapping Web services are parameterized to allow a high degree of flexibility to access the data. For example, mappings can be accessed for one ontology mapped to all other ontologies, between pairs of ontologies, for one term mapped to all other terms, and between pairs of terms. This Web service can also be used to submit mappings directly to BioPortal. The NCBO Annotator Web service processes text to recognize terms from ontologies in BioPortal that exist within the text. The Annotator Web service uses the entity recognizer Mgrep, which outperforms MetaMap in almost all cases evaluated for precision. The Web service parameters can be set to limit results to a particular ontology or to certain UMLS semantic types and characterisitcs of the term matches can also be parameterized, e.g. to recognize both preferred name and synonyms, match terms greater than X characters in length, and the ability to include a custom list of stopwords. The NCBO Annotator Web service was used to generate an ontology-based index of several online biomedical data repositories (e.g., GEO, ClinicalTrials.gov, dbGaP, DrugBank, PharmGKB, and Reactome) resulting in the NCBO Resource Index . The textual metadata of data records from these resources was annotated with terms from ontologies in BioPortal and then stored locally for query efficiency. Therefore, data records across databases are linked together via their shared ontology annotations. These linkages take advantage of the semantic relationships within the ontology, including subsumption relationships among ontology entities and mappings between entities in different ontologies. The Resource Index is designed to provide updates in both new resource data records and new ontology versions. The NCBO Resource Index Web services provide a mechanism for programmatic search of the index using ontology terms. For example, one can search for all experiments and clinical trials related to \u2018malignant melanoma\u2019 from GEO and ClinicalTrials.gov.
