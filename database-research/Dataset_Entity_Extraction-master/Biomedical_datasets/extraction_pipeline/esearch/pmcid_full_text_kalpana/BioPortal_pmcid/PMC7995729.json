In recent years, the incidence and mortality of HCC have been increasing in North America and several European regions, while in traditional high-risk areas, including Japan and parts of China, the incidence and mortality of HCC have been declining.

Therefore, patients with advanced HCC have a lower overall survival rate.

PRDXs have constitutive expression in almost all tissues and cell types, although they differ in expression levels, and also exist in the extracellular environments,. PRDXs can reduce peroxide through catalyzing the oxidation of cysteine to sulfenic acid. According to the position of cysteine residues in the catalytic reactions, they can be divided into three subgroups: typical 2-Cys: PRDX1-4; atypical 2-Cys: PRDX5 and 1-Cys: PRDX6. Among them, PRDX1, expressed in the cytoplasm of cells, is identified as the stress-induced macrophage protein produced by mouse peritoneal macrophages exposed to oxidative stress. Extracellular PRDX1 plays a critical role in inflammatory regulation. It can be used as a molecular chaperone to regulate the actions of multitudinous molecules, or act as a regulator of transcription. PRDX2, the peroxidase activity of which is activated by CDK2, inhibits the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells.

To explore the role of PRDXs in the prognosis of HCC patients, the data from several public databases were analyzed and evaluated in this study through a variety of online tools. Firstly, according to the data from CCLE, PRDXs were expressed in multiple cancer cell lines, and the levels of PRDXs in HCC cell lines were mainly between 6 and 9. Knoops et al. also found that PRDXs were expressed in almost all tissues and cell lines. In addition, the analysis of UALCAN database indicated that the mRNA expression of PRDX1/2/5/6 in HCC was significantly upregulated, while the mRNA expression of PRDX4 was downregulated. Similar results were obtained from the analysis of different HCC datasets in HCCDB. Immumohistochemical staining results in Human Protein Atlas database showed that PRDX1/2/5 were highly expressed in HCC tissues, while the expression of PRDX3/4 was low. This was similar to the results of Aguilar-Melero et al. research, that is, PRDX1 was highly expressed in various tumors including HCC. Zhou et al. demonstrated that PRDX2 was often downregulated in HCC tissues, and played a tumorigenic role. Xu et al. found that the expression level of PRDX6 in HCC tissues was lower than that in matched para-carcinoma tissues.

The downregulation of PRDX3 and PRDX6 was correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Although the relationship between PRDX2 and prognosis of HCC patients has not been reported, the low expression of PRDX2 was confirmed to be associated with liver metastasis and poor overall survival rate of colorectal cancer.

There were 24 cases with mRNA upregulation mutations of PRDX1, 19 cases with mRNA upregulation mutations of PRDX3, and 33 cases with mRNA upregulation mutations of PRDX6. More genetic alterations may be one reason why the expression levels of PRDX3 or PRDX6 are not consistent in different datasets. The tab network in cBioPortal was used to detect the adjacent genes of PRDXs, frequency of which were changed, with MYC (18.6%), MAPK1 (13.1%) and PBK (11.4%) having the most frequent changes in frequency. MYC is the main regulator of cell metabolism and proliferation, high constitutive expression of which drives many types of tumors, and often correlated with cancer invasion and poor prognosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), belonging to the MAP kinase family, is served as a binding site for many biochemical signals and involved in various cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, transcriptional development and regulation. PBK is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKK) family. PBK has a high trans-activity, plays a crucial role in various cancers, and also promotes migration and invasion of lung cancer cell.
