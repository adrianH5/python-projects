The former requires significant time commitment from SR-MA researchers while the latter makes it difficult to combine results from primary research studies. Although the introduction of reporting guidelines and standards have partially resolved the issue, the quality of scientific reporting continues to be below expectations. In the context of diagnostic studies, the prevailing lack of transparency in reporting was addressed by the introduction of the STARD guidelines in 2003. Recent reports suggest that widespread conformance is yet to be achieved among journal articles and quality of reporting is similar between the pre STARD and post STARD implementation phase.
