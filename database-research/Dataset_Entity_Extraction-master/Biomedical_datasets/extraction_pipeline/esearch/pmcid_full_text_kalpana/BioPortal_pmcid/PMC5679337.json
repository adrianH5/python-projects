The primary reason for attrition in clinical trials is the lack of efficacy, which has been associated with poor or biased target selection. Although the drug target mechanism of action is not required for FDA approval, a target-based mechanistic understanding of diseases and drug action is highly desirable and a preferred approach of drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. Following the advent of the Human Genome, several research groups in academia as well as industry have focused on \u201cthe druggable genome\u201d i.e. the subsets of genes in the human genome that express proteins that have the ability to bind drug-like small molecules. The researchers have estimated the number of druggable targets ranging from few hundreds to several thousands. Furthermore, it has been suggested by several analyses that only a small fraction of likely relevant druggable targets are extensively studied, leaving a potentially huge treasure trove of promising, yet understudied (\u201cdark\u201d) drug targets to be explored by pharmaceutical companies and academic drug discovery researchers. Not only is there ambiguity about the number of the druggable targets, but there is also a need of systematic characterization and annotation of the druggable genome. A few research groups have made efforts to address these issues and have indeed developed several useful resources, e.g. IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb/IUPHAR), PANTHER, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), Potential Drug Target Database (PDTD) , covering important aspects of the drug targets.

DTO content was curated from several resources and the literature, and includes detailed hierarchical classifications of proteins and genes, tissue localization, disease association, drug target development level, protein domain information, ligands, substrates, and other types of relevant information.

Once ontologists proposed a conceptual ontology model, the selection of the most robust ontology model was guided by simple criteria: correct representation of domain content, minimize the number of relations to link all metadata, avoid contradiction with existing domain knowledge representation ontologies, such as the OBO ontologies. For example, in our conceptual model, the relations among organ, tissue, cell lines and anatomical entity were adopted and refined from the UBERON and CLO ontologies.

Secondly, while developers load curated data into a local staging database, another QC step is taking place to assure data integrity during the loading process. Thirdly, as soon as the auto-ontology building using OntoJOG finishes, reasoning over the whole ontology checks for consistency of the logical definitions and the ontology itself.

DTO covers proteins as prospective druggable targets. Druggability can be considered from a structural point of view, i.e. proteins to which small molecules can bind. This structural druggability is implicit in the selection of the IDG target families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors for which there exist a large number of small molecule binders. Another aspect of druggability is the ability to induce a therapeutic benefit by modulating the biological function of the protein that the drug binds to. Establishing and prioritizing this functional druggability is one of the main goals of the IDG project. DTO includes knowledge of protein disease association and the target development level for all proteins as a foundation to formally describe drug mechanisms of actions. DTO provides a framework and formal classification based on function and phylogenetics, rich annotations of (protein) drug targets along with other chemical, biological, and clinical classifications and relations to diseases and tissue expression. This may facilitate the rational and systematic development of novel small molecule drugs by integrating mechanism of action (drug targets) with disease models, mechanisms, and phenotypes. DTO is already used in the Target Central Resource Database (TCRD - http://juniper.health.unm.edu/tcrd), the IDG main portal Pharos (http://pharos.nih.gov/) and the Target Importance and Novelty eXplorer (TIN-X - http://newdrugtargets.org/) to prioritize drug targets by novelty and importance.

As we develop DTO and other resources, we will facilitate the otherwise challenging integration and formal linking of biochemical and cell-based assays, phenotypes, disease models, omics data, drug targets and drug poly-pharmacology, binding sites, kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery.

This is facilitated by our modularization approach. The modular architecture allows the developers create terms in a more systematic way by creating manageable and contained components. For example, DTO vocabularies are created as separate files by the OntoJOG java tool. Vocabulary files contain only classes and subsumption relations; the files are subsequently combined (imported) into the DTO core module. A similar, separate module is created of classes from external ontologies; thus, cleanly separating responsibilities of ontology maintenance while providing a seamless integrated product for the users. OntoJOG auto-generated axioms import these vocabulary modules. The manual (expert-created) more complex axioms are layered on top. This way, when an existing data resources is updated, one only needs to update the corresponding auto-created file, e.g. the kinase vocabulary, or target-disease associations from the DISEASES database. Updating of the auto-generated modules (including axioms) does not overwrite expert-created, more complex axioms, which formalize knowledge that cannot easily be maintained in a relational database. Separating domain-specific vocabularies also improves maintenance by multiple specialized curators and may improve future crowd-based development and maintenance. The modular design also makes it simpler to use DTO content in related projects such as LINCS or BAO. Last but not least, the modular architecture facilitates different \u201cflavors\u201d of DTO by incorporating upper-level ontologies, such as BFO or SUMO, via specific mapping (axiom) files; different DTO flavors can be useful for different user groups, e.g. a native version for typical end users of software products (such as Pharos or TinX) or a BFO version for ontologists who develop more expansive, integrated and consistent knowledge models.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 51202, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several drug target-related resources have been developed, such as the ChEMBL Drug Target Slim, where GO annotations are available for drug targets in ChEMBL.

The Open Targets Partnership between pharmaceutical companies and the EBI (http://www.opentargets.org/) is a complementary project with similarities to IDG.

Although there is significant overlap in the content integrated by both projects, there is currently little coordination with respect to data standards including ontologies and data representation. For example, Open Target uses the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) to annotate diseases whereas IDG and the DTO uses DOID, primarily because of its use in DISEASES.
