We then selected 2 genera that are well represented in the data set, and built \u201csequence similarity networks\u201d for each of them. In selecting these genera, we looked for ones that are prolific enough within the ontology to generate informative (non-trivial) networks, yet not so prolific as to be unwieldy in terms of visualization or computation. In practice, we looked for two genera with approximately 20 species in the ontology. For each genus selected, we used BLASTp to align all pairs of peptides within the genus. We constructed the networks using peptide sequences as nodes, and the alignments between them as edges. We transformed the BLAST scores (which represent the percent coverage of the alignments; denoted S)for alignments using the following equation: which allows us to define a \u201cdistance\u201d between two peptide sequences (i.e., smaller values of S\u2019 indicate higher similarity), used as edge weights in the final networks. S\u2019 is a value in the interval [0,1), and is generally very small (e.g., <1*10\u221215). Finally, we filtered edges by setting a maximum expect value (\u201ce-value\u201d - a normalized p-value defining confidence that the alignment is non-random) threshold of 1*10\u221250. Alignments that fell below this maximum cutoff almost certainly signify evolutionarily related sequences, and are therefore informative for the purposes of constructing these networks.

The plot, shown with number of peptides per venom on a logarithmic scale, highlights that there are many outliers in the dataset - species with extremely complex venoms compared to the mean of 9.922 peptides per venom. Furthermore, each of the taxonomic groups has its own unique distribution. Although the sizes of some groups in the ontology are too small to result in viable statistical inferences (e.g., mammals and amphibians), variable distributions of venom complexity suggest that complexity is regulated in some manner that is conserved by evolution - otherwise, all of the distributions would converge. In particular, insects seem to have venoms that are relatively simple compared to arachnids, molluscs, and reptiles. Interestingly, arachnids have the largest number of outlier species that have extremely complex venoms. Reptiles, by far the most well-represented group in the dataset, have notably fewer highly complex outliers than either molluscs or arachnids.
