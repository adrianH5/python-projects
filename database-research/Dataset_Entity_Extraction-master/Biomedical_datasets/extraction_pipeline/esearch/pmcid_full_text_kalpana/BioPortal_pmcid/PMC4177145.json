Experimentally, Crampe et al. mated an albino female to a wild gray male in 1880. In the F1 offspring, three mutant genes were phenotypically observed: c (albino), a (non-agouti), and h (hooded) . An early effort to track new strains and substrains, focused on when rats were transferred from one lab to another, resulting in new substrains that could affect animals both phenotypically and genotypically by the resultant changes in environment, dietary conditions or breeding strategy, as well as spontaneous genetic variations. The list of codes used to designate laboratories developing and maintaining rat colonies was first published in 1973 . Efforts have also been made to capture differences in phenotype by integrating microsatellite markers into the genetic linkage maps  and radiation hybrid maps . In order to make significant comparisons, determine relationships amongst strains, and select an appropriate model for biomedical studies, knowledge of the different rat strains and their breeding approaches is crucial. The first attempt to create a phylogenetic tree for 13 inbred strains (homozygous strain produced by brother-sister mating for at least 20+ generations) using genetic markers was done by Canzian et al. . This was followed by an enhanced version comprising 63 inbred strains and 214 substrains (genetically diverse inbred strains due to separation after 20 generations or separated due to any genetic difference), which was plotted using the percentage of genotypic differences . Thomas et al. presented phylogenetic relationships of 48 inbred strains, using the allele size of each strain at each microsatellite locus . A phylogenetic tree is also available at The National BioResource Project for the Rat in Japan , for 132 rat strains. Maximum parsimony analysis was used to calculate this tree ( http://www.anim.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nbr/phylo.aspx).

In order to do this, the strain nomenclature had to be parsed so that the parental/ancestral strains could be determined and progeny placed accordingly. In the latest version (version 5.1) of the RS Ontology, dated September 2013, there are 3503 terms, which include 13 different types of first level nodes depicting the strain types (Figure\u00a0 1). 62% of the terms have one parent, including parental strains and placeholder terms used to organize the strains properly. For example, all congenic strains (strains in which a chromosomal segment has been transferred from a donor strain to a recipient strain but which is otherwise identical to the original inbred recipient strain) that are derived from the same parental strains DA and F344 are placed under the congenic placeholder DA.F344 (RS:0000237). This is further branched into congenic placeholders DA/BklArbN.F344/NHsd (RS:0001224) and DA/BklArbNsi.F344/NHsd (RS:0003211). These second level terms house the actual congenic strains, for example DA.F344-(D10Arb21-D10Arb22)/Arb (RS:0000210), DA.F344-(D10Rat37-D10Arb22)/Arb (RS:0000209). As a result, 1% of the terms have more than 3 parents. The addition of congenic substrains (substrains derived from the parental congenic strains) and mutant strains generated another layer of complexity in the vocabulary and also justify the fact that breeding techniques are crucial in defining a rat strain. Hence, it was clear that the strain background impacts the newly developed strain and its phenotype.

In this format all the inbred strains and the different strains types were the main nodes. This format was not able to differentiate between the substrains and congenic strains of the same parental strain. For example, the substrain: ACI/Eur (RS:0000021) and congenic placeholder: BUF.ACI (RS:0000432) were under the parental node ACI which was a first level node under rat strains (Figure\u00a0 2A). This format was replaced in the latest version 5.1 where the strain types are first nodes (Figure\u00a0 2B). This major version change referred to a global change in the structure of the ontology. Therefore, ACI is an inbred strain which is placed under \"inbred\" with all substrains under it, whereas the related congenic strains are under the node \"congenic strain\". Another node recently added is the \"chromosome altered\" (Figure\u00a0 3A). This node has all the chromosomes which can be further divided into the relevant strain types, for example: congenic, consomic (strains in which a whole chromosome has been transferred from a donor strain to a recipient strain but is otherwise identical to the original inbred recipient strain) and mutant (strains in which a gene has been modified or spontaneous mutant with an altered phenotype). All the strains in which the chromosomes have been manipulated are placed under the \"chromosome altered\" node, as well as under their specific categories.

The technique used to create the specific mutant is mentioned in parenthesis. The mutant strain in which a particular gene is mutated is placed under the relative chromosome number; for example, gene Tgfb1 (transforming growth factor, beta 1) maps to chromosome 1 in the rat, so the heterozygous mutant strain SS-Tgfb1em3Mcwi-/+ (RS:0003129) is placed under SS/JrHsdMcwi Heterozygous (ZFN) mutants (Figure\u00a0 3B). This strain, having a mutation in chromosome 1, is also under SS/JrHsdMcwi (ZFN) mutants (chr 1) a sub-branch of \"chromosome 1 mutant\" under \"chromosome altered\".
