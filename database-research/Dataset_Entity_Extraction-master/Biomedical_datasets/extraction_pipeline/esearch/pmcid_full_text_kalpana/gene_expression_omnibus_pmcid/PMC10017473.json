Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death and reported to mediate selective motor neuron death in the mouse model of ALS. The growing awareness of ferroptosis and iron metabolism dysfunction in ALS prompted us to investigate the expression pattern of ferroptosis and iron metabolism-related genes (FIRGs) in ALS. Here, we performed a conjoint analysis of bulk-RNA sequence and single-nucleus RNA sequence data using the datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to reveal the role of FIRGs in ALS, especially in selective motor neuron death of ALS. We first investigated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ALS and non-neurological controls. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis constructed the gene co-expression network and identified three modules closely associated with ALS. Fifteen FIRGs was identified as target genes based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis as follows: ACSL4, ANO6, ATP6V0E1, B2M, CD44, CHMP5, CYBB, CYBRD1, HIF1A, MOSPD1, NCF2, SDCBP, STEAP2, TMEM14C, ULK1. These genes could differentiate ALS patients from non-neurological controls (p < 2.2e\u221216) and had a valid value in predicting and diagnosing ALS (AUC = 0.881 in primary dataset and AUC = 0.768 in validation dataset). Then we performed the functional enrichment analysis of DEGs between ALS cases, the most significantly influenced by target genes, and non-neurological controls. The result indicated that the most significantly influenced functions in ALS pathogenesis by these identified FIRGs are synapse pathways, calcium signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, and phagosome and several immune pathways. At last, the analysis of single- nuclear seq found that CHMP5, one of the 15 FIRGs identified by bulk single-nucleus RNA-seq data, was expressed significantly higher in ALS than pathologically normal (PN), specifically in excitatory neuron populations with layer 2 and layer 3 markers (Ex L2_L3), layer 3 and layer 5 markers (Ex L3_L5).

Since iron is a redox ion, it can induce free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), which participates in the regulation of cell survival and death. ROS can cause cell damage by destroying the iron homeostasis of cells, leading to a vicious circle. Evidence from past decades links iron homeostasis to neuronal cell death in ALS. In ALS patients, MRI reveals increased iron accumulation in motor cortex. The markers of lipid oxidation and iron status are correlated with clinical function decline in ALS. Another study showed that moderate iron chelation regimen may incorporate a novel curative option for neuroprotection in ALS. ALS is the most common motor neuron disorder, and show selective vulnerability of motor neurons in cortex.

In a recent study of ALS/FTD associated C9orf72, the protein product of C9orf72 could control the initiation of autophagy by regulating ULK1 complex trafficking. As a pro-survival factor of ferroptosis, HIF1A is a major transcription factor that can regulate the homeostatic responses to reduced oxygen level in microenvironment. reported that the HIF-1 signaling pathway exhibited significant abnormalities during hypoxia in sporadic ALS cases. The expression of ACSL4 determines sensitivity to ferroptosis. Knockout or inhibition of ACSL4 caused a dramatic reduction in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in membranes, and targeted inhibitors of ACSL4 improved tissue death in a mouse model of ferroptosis. It is reported that ACSL4 plays important roles in A\u03b2-induced changes in cell survival, myocardial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation in AD mice model. CYBB (also known as NOX2) participated in the transmission of electrons across the plasma membrane to produce superoxide and other downstream ROS. In ALS patients, NOX2 activity presented a negative correlation with survival time, while inactivation of NOX2 delayed the progression of neurodegeneration in ALS SOD1 transgenic mice. NCF2 is responsible for the synthesis of superoxide in neutrophils. As an oxidative stress gene, NCF2 has been considered as a potential biomarker for Friedreich\u2019s ataxia disease progression and drug action. ANO6 is one of the anoctamins, a family of Ca2 + -activated chloride channels and phospholipid scramblases. ANO6 can lead to the activation of lipid peroxidation as a mechanism proposed earlier in ferroptosis. In ALS mice model, the ANO6/TMEM16F loss of function reduces denervation and motor decline. In contrast, CD44 can inhibit oxidative stress and ferroptosis through regulating GPX4. CD44 can enhance the stability of SLC7A11, which is a protective factor for cells through synthesizes reduced glutathione (GSH) by promoting the uptake of cystine. Study in SOD1 (G93A) mice showed the expression of CD44 in astrocytes and microglia was accompanied by the pathogenesis of ALS. CHMP5, a core component of ESCRT-III pathway, has been shown to gather in the plasma membrane during ferroptosis. ESCRT-III could participate in the inversely modulated ferroptosis, mediating plasma membrane repair and decreasing lipid peroxidation. Genetic inhibition of CHMP5 enhanced ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Previous study showed that higher CHMP5 level in whole blood was positively associated with shorter survival of ALS patients, with potential as a biomarker for ALS prognosis. B2M localizes to the cell membrane and is a member of major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC-1), which participates in synaptic function and axonal regeneration. Widely expressed in human brain, B2M has been shown to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases and has previously been described in sporadic ALS studies. SDCBP can interact with a variety of signal proteins, and regulate the different signaling transduction pathways. It is reported that individuals with AD had increased SDCBP expression. In addition, CYBRD1, STEAP2 and TMEM14C are significantly involved in iron transport and HEME metabolism. Dysfunction of these genes could cause iron accumulation and iron homeostasis disorders. However, it\u2019s still unclear about the MOSPD1 and ATP6VE01 involved in the process of ferroptosis, and there is no evidence to support their role in ALS. Overall, these findings may provide a new perspective for exploring the molecular mechanism underlying ALS pathogenesis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23649, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For enrichment analysis, to detect which pathways the FIRGs is mainly involved in the pathogenic process of ALS, we clustered all ALS samples to 3 groups based on the correlation with 15 FIRGs. The group 3 has the most significant correlation with 15 FIRGs. We performed KEGG pathway analysis on all upregulated genes and all downregulated genes in group 3. The result revealed that functional enrichment of downregulated DEGs in ALS 3 is in synaptically important pathways, calcium signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway. Progressive synapse loss and dysfunction is known to occur in the early stage of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and ALS. Glutamate excitotoxicity, driven by the hyperactivity of excitatory neurons, plays an important role in ALS pathology. One possible reason is the inherent variations in the firing properties of neurons or a reduction in the inhibitory control of GABAergic cells. Interestingly, in KEGG analysis of this study, GABAergic synapse pathway was also enriched of downregulated DEGs in the ALS3 subgroup, suggesting that the inhibitory networks belonged to vulnerability in ALS, consistent with reports in ALS animal models and human cadavers. On the other hand, a recent study revealed that cAMP/PKA activation and neuronal firing were beneficial for synaptic recovery and ameliorated the ALS-related pathobiochemistry. Their hypothesis is that dysfunction of excitatory synapses is an important factor affecting the excitatory drive of motor neurons and the degeneration of motor neurons. Our analysis also found the inactivation of the PKA signaling pathway in ALS3 cases. In addition, the calcium signaling pathway is downregulated in our analysis. Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis participates in the pathogenesis of ALS by affecting some major and interrelated toxicity pathways like oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. In the pathways of upregulated DEGs enriched, phagosome plays an important role both in ALS and ferroptosis. Autophagosomes are double-membrane vesicles that participate in the process of autophagy. The main role of autophagy in ALS commonly includes affecting the accumulation of protein aggregates and the function of mitochondria in motor neurons. Excessive autophagy, especially selective types of autophagy, and impaired lysosomal activity may drive cells toward ferroptosis. The key types include ferritinophagy, lipophagy, clockophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26198, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The primary motor cortex is essential for voluntary motor control, sending layer 5 intratelencephalic tract and pyramidal tract output projections to modulate the execution of movement.

Here we analyzed the 15 FIRGs\u2019 expression in primary motor cortex neurons between 17 sporadic ALS and 17 PN. More interestingly, by analyzing single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we found that in CHMP5, one of the 15 FIRGs, is dysregulated in ExL2_L3 and ExL3_L5, indicating that in ALS patient, excitatory neurons located in motor cortex layer 2_3 and layer 3_5 have higher CHMP5 expression and may be more vulnerable to ferroptosis and iron metabolism dysfunction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27227, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, our results demonstrate that FIRGs are significant factors in the ALS pathogenesis.
