The study is aimed at identifying hub genes associated with carcinogenesis and prognosis for CRC. We identified and validated 212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We investigated functional enrichment analysis for DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and hub modules and genes in CRC carcinogenesis were extracted. A prognostic signature was developed and validated based on Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The DEGs mainly regulated biological processes covering response to stimulus, metabolic process, and affected molecular functions containing protein binding and catalytic activity. The DEGs played important roles in CRC-related pathways involving in preneoplastic lesions, carcinogenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Hub genes closely related to CRC carcinogenesis were extracted including six genes in model 1 (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL11, NMU, and PPBP) and two genes and Metallothioneins (MTs) in model 2 (SLC26A3 and SLC30A10). Among them, CXCL8 was also related to prognosis. An eight-gene signature was proposed comprising AMH, WBSCR28, SFTA2, MYH2, POU4F1, SIX4, PGPEP1L, and PAX5.

The number of cases diagnosed is forecast to rise from 1800 million now to 3093 million by 2040 through the World Health Organization. Although modern medicine has made great advances, CRC is still the third leading cause for cancer-related mortality. As we all know, early detection of CRC has some effect on reducing its mortality and the discovery of precursor lesion can even cut down the incidence. Early diagnosis with better survival and later diagnosis with worse prognosis have no doubt. Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, identified by the American Joint Committee on Cancer according to pathologic and clinical factors, is not only the fundamental for treatment but also the gold standard for CRC prognosis. The 5-year survival rate at stage I is more than 90%, and the 5-year survival rate for stage IV is only 10%. However, 20% of patients at stage II undergo cancer-specific death and some stage III patients confront better outcomes than some patients at stage II.

The biological process analysis suggested that the upregulated genes were mainly implicated in multiple metabolic processes including collagen catabolic process, multicellular organismal catabolic process, collagen metabolic process, multicellular organismal macromolecule metabolic process, and multicellular organismal metabolic process. The downregulated genes were primarily involved in various responses to stimulus, response to chemical stimulus like chemotaxis and response to nutrient, response to external stimulus like taxis and response to extracellular stimulus, and response to endogenous stimulus like response to glucocorticoid stimulus, response to corticosteroid stimulus, response to steroid hormone stimulus, and response to hormone stimulus. The molecular function analysis showed that the upregulated genes chiefly affected protein binding containing chemokine activity, chemokine receptor binding, cytokine activity, G-protein-coupled receptor binding, receptor binding, etc. The downregulated genes had much effect on catalytic activity such as lyase activity, oxidoreductase activity, transferase activity, and hydrolase activity. For the reactome pathway enrichment analysis, the upregulated genes mostly focused on regulation of the immune system and inflammation and cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

Topological parameters of genes in module 1 were not significantly different, but the pathway enrichment results mainly accumulated in pathways regulated by 46 upregulated genes, which revealed the major status of CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL11, NMU, and PPBP. Increased CXCL1 levels had positive relationships with tumor size, degree of invasion, advancing stage, metastasis, and poor prognosis. High expression of CXCL3 was detected in premalignant adenomas and CRC tissue, and CXCL3 significantly downregulated in liver metastasis compared with the primary tumor. And CXCL3 obviously presented high expression in patients with local relative to systemic disease. On the contrary, overexpression of CXCL8 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, which was strongly correlated with CRC angiogenesis, metastasis, poor prognosis, and disease-free survival. However, high expression of CXCL8 could act as a protective barrier for liver metastasis of CRC and coincide with better prognosis. Objectively, the role of CXCL8 still remained in dispute. This study confirmed that CXCL8 was associated with prognosis and suggested that the high CXCL8 expression group had a better prognosis than the low expression group. Besides angiogenesis, CXCL11 was an important cytokine in the progression of inflammation to CRC and induced tumor-associated macrophages to infiltrate, which enhanced the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells and generated poor prognosis. NMU was capable of facilitating the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. PPBP, also known as CXCL7, was overexpressed in CRC and associated with poor prognosis and disease-free survival. SLC26A3 and SLC30A10 were uncovered as hub genes in model 2, and the top 2 significant pathways hit on MT1M, MT1X, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, and MT1E, which occupied the one-sided subnetwork of model 2. SLC26A3 downexpressed in CRC played a tumor suppressor role and was expected to be a candidate epithelial marker in CRC. SLC30A10 was acceptable to classify methylation epigenotypes and correlated with molecular genesis in CRC. MTs, a protein family of low molecular weight and full of cysteine, contained at least 11 functional isoforms and implicated in zinc and redox metabolism. MTs were epigenetically downregulated in CRC early progression (especially MT1G) and tended to induce a worse prognosis. MT overexpression represented a crucial early step in the development of ulcerative colitis-associated CRC. MT expression was also a potential reminder affecting lymph node metastases, particularly in patients with synchronous liver metastases. MT1G uncovered the capability of tumor suppressor via promoting CRC differentiation through zinc signaling. Also, MT1G overexpression sensitized CRC cells to oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil via activating p53 and repressing NF-\u03baB activity. In addition, CXCL13 and CLCA1 in hub modules were downregulated, and high expression of that had a better prognosis. CXCL13 showed significantly lower expression in CRC, and patients with CXCL13 deletion had a significantly higher risk of relapse.

The test group validated the prognostic value of the eight-gene signature capable of good reproducibility and robustness, which suggested that the eight-gene signature could improve prognostic prediction at the molecular level beyond the conventional TNM stage. The eight-gene signature also pushed the limitation of traditional TNM stage for prognostic prediction due to molecular heterogeneity in CRC. Currently, several gene signatures have been reported for prognostic prediction of CRC. Compared to the reported signatures, the uniqueness of this study was that LASSO regression analysis could execute feature selection and shrinkage and screen highly correlated genes, which determined the optimal genes to participate in subsequent signature building. LASSO regression could prevent the gene signature overfitting and increase the accuracy of bioinformatics analysis. We explored both ROC curve and test verification to assess the prognostic performance of the signature.
