It was estimated that 20,160 new cases would be diagnosed, and 4,410 cases of death of this disease would occur only in the United States in 2022. Notably, most newly diagnosed patients present only with asymptomatic peripheral blood lymphocytosis or leukocytosis. Currently, the diagnosis of CLL is based mainly on blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B lymphocytes. Immunohistologically, the coexpression of CD5 and CD23 on the clonal population of B cells, detected by flow cytometry, can be sued for the diagnosis of most CLL cases. Unfortunately, a risk of misdiagnosis might exist between CLL and other lymphoid malignancies with similar morphological features and CD5 positivity, such as mantle cell lymphoma and atypical lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Neither the prognosis nor the treatment regimen of the aforementioned disorders is the same, leading to serious adverse consequences of a misdiagnosis. Due to the overlapping immunophenotypes and the possibility of the occurrence of similar histological patterns, lymphomas may resemble CLL. Hence, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and anatomical pathology have particular limitations in the diagnosis of CLL from other entities. Moreover, CLL cases are not uniform in clinical practice, and some exhibit atypical features such as CD5- or CD23-negative. Therefore, novel, more reliable biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis of CLL.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3739, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Over the past decade, next-generation sequencing technology and microarray analysis have been widely applied as fundamental methods in neoplastic disorders for multiple clinical utilization, including molecular diagnosis and prediction of prognosis.

For instance, the PTX3 gene was considered a marker associated with CLL disease. Moreover, the oncogene MSI2 was identified as a differential prediagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target of CLL. In a previous study, miR-15b and miR-195 were reported to have the potential to function as novel and noninvasive biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with B-CLL.

Subsequently, LASSO regression analysis was used to identify the six final hub genes from the fourteen intersecting genes between the DEGs and the candidate hub genes. The gene expression patterns in the training cohort and different validation cohorts were consistent, with a statistically significant difference between the CLL and the control samples. Nevertheless, the values of control samples in the GSE51528 dataset were not the same as those in other cohorts. Unlike other datasets using normal cells isolated from peripheral blood as normal controls, the GSE51528 dataset used normal B-cell subpopulations from tonsils as controls. The expression of the same gene could be different in various tissues, and the AUC value could have differed because of the use of different tissues as controls. Despite this drawback, the AUC values of the six genes were over 0.8. The six newly identified biomarkers still had a good performance in predicting CLL diagnosis even in the tonsils as controls instead of in specimens of peripheral blood. Of the identified hub genes, ABCA6, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, acts as a probable transporter which may play a role in macrophage lipid transport and homeostasis. PMEPA1 regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and immunosuppression through the TGF-beta signaling pathway. EBF1 has been confirmed to be the key pioneer transcription factor of B-cell specification and commitment by poising or activating lineage-specific genes and repressing genes related with alternative cell fates. Overexpressed FILIP1L was found to modulate the antiangiogenic activity in endothelial cells, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and migration as well as an increase in apoptosis. TEAD2 has been found to be relevant to tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis through the Hippo signaling pathway. CCDC88A serves as a nonreceptor guanine nucleotide exchange factor which binds to and activates guanine nucleotide-binding protein G (i) alpha subunits, involved in multiple biological processes, such as cell migration and cellular immunity. However, the specific role of these six genes in CLL has not been reported yet.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16542, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To explore the possible mechanisms by which the hub genes were involved in the nosogenesis of CLL, we performed GO, KEGG, ssGSEA, and correlation analyses. GO function analysis indicated that the biological processes of DEGs were enriched mainly in B-cell activation and proliferation as well as the regulation of leukocyte cell-cell adhesion. KEGG analysis predominantly included immune-associated pathways (e.g., an intestinal immune network for IgA production, ECM-receptor interaction, and leukocyte transendothelial migration). These results suggest that CLL is closely related to tumor immunity. Therefore, ssGSEA was applied to further investigate the differences in the immune cell infiltration between CLL and control samples. We found that T-cell coinhibition was significantly upregulated in the CLL group, which is a vital element contributing to immune function suppression by providing inhibitory signals to activated T cells. Furthermore, various immune-related cells, such as CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), were significantly more overexpressed in the CLL samples than in the controls. CD8+ T cells exhibited profound functional deficits in the proliferation and cytotoxicity despite an increase in their absolute numbers in the peripheral blood. Treg, which is a subset of CD4+ T cells, was also found to be increased in CLL patients. Dysregulation of Tregs leads to an unbalanced immune system and contributes to immune suppression, disease progression, and poor prognosis. Coinhibitory molecules expressed by tumor infiltrating T cells and Tregs were previously considered to constitute a pivotal mechanism by promoting tumor immune evasion. The correlations of the hub genes identified here with immune-related functions and cells were also determined, showing significant interactions between the hub genes and tumor immunity. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the selected genes may modulate the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor immune evasion in CLL through inhibitory immune cells. Serious defects in the immune system and the capacity of leukemic cells to escape immune recognition played an irreplaceable role in the nosogenesis and progression of CLL, which was in agreement with the findings of the present study.
