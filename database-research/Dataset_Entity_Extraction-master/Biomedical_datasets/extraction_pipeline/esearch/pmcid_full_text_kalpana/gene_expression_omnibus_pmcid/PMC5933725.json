In this study, we aimed to explore the expression profiles of SCN4B in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and its prognostic value in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS) in classical PTC. In addition, we also examined the potential effect of DNA methylation on its expression. A retrospective study was performed by using data from available large databases, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Thyroid Cancer (THCA). Results showed that SCN4B is downregulated at both RNA and protein level in PTC compared with normal thyroid tissues. Preserved SCN4B expression was an independent indicator of favorable RFS in patients with classical PTC, no matter as categorical variables (HR: 0.243, 95%CI: 0.107\u20130.551, p = 0.001) or as a continuous variable (HR: 0.684, 95%CI: 0.520\u20130.899, p = 0.007). The methylation status of one CpG site (Chr11: 118,022,316\u2013318) in SCN4B DNA had a moderately negative correlation with SCN4B expression in all PTC cases (Pearson\u2019s r = -0.48) and in classical PTC cases (Pearson\u2019s r = -0.41). In comparison, SCN4B DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) were not frequent and might not influence its mRNA expression. In addition, no somatic mutation was found in SCN4B DNA. Based on these findings, we infer that preserved SCN4B expression might independently predict favorable RFS in classical PTC. Its expression might be suppressed by DNA hypermethylation, but is less likely to be influenced by DNA CNAs/mutations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1850, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1863, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are integral membrane proteins that constitute one large pore-forming principal \u03b1 subunit and one or two smaller transmembrane \u03b2 subunits as auxiliary (encoded by SCN1B to SCN4B genes).

Some recent studies found that the sodium channel \u03b2 subunits are dysregulated in oncogenic processes. SCN1B expression is decreased in highly metastatic breast cancer cells lines, but is increased in highly metastatic prostate cancer cell lines.

In mouse model bearing implanted prostate tumor, SCN1B expression is associated with enhanced growth rate and size, as well as decreases in survival rates. In breast cancer, enforced SCN1B expression could promote pathological growth and cellular dissemination, including metastasis to both lung and liver. In cervical cancer tissues, SCN3B mRNA level is increased, whereas SCN1B, SCN2B and SCN4B mRNA levels are decreased. SCN3B is induced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner and mediates a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. In breast cancer cells, reduced SCN4B expression is associated with increased RhoA activity, enhanced cell migration and invasiveness, primary tumor growth and metastatic spreading, via promoting the acquisition of an amoeboid-mesenchymal hybrid phenotype.

In addition, we also observed that the PTC cases with lymph nodal invasion had significantly lower SCN4B expression. In classical PTC subtype, we confirmed the association between decreased SCN4B expression and the risk of recurrence. PTC patients usually have long-term overall survival and the primary goal of surgery is to minimize the risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis. Therefore, we decided to further investigate the potential prognostic value of SCN4B expression in terms of RFS in the classical subtype. By generating Kaplan-Meier curves of RFS, we found that the high SCN4B expression group had significantly better RFS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that preserved SCN4B expression was an independent indicator of favorable RFS in patients with classical PTC, no matter as categorical variables (HR: 0.243, 95%CI: 0.107\u20130.551, p = 0.001) or as a continuous variable (HR: 0.684, 95%CI: 0.520\u20130.899, p = 0.007).
