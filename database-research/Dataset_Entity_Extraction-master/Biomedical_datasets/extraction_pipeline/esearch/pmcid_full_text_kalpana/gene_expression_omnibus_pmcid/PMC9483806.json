Although the treatment pattern of NSCLC has been changed dramatically by immunotherapy, PD-1/L1 monotherapy is strictly selective for patients, with significant benefit in patients with >50% of cells expressing PD-L1.

With these major technological breakthroughs, mRNA have becoming potential treatment strategy of cancers. Since they are not integrated into the genome, mRNA vaccines do not have the potential risk of insertional mutations and can be degraded by RNases in vivo. To date, clinical trials of mRNA vaccine have been conducted against prostate cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, blood cancer, showing a potential efficacy. However, the mRNA vaccine for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still uncertain due to the tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment (TME) and other factors. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find tumor-specific antigens in LUAD to change the landscape of treatment, either by mono-vaccine or in combination with immunotherapy. At present, vaccine application faces two major challenges, one is identifying specific antigens of tumor cells, and the other is avoiding immune cell depletion caused by unfavorable properties of the TME.The workflow of our study was shown in Fig. S1A. In our study, two tumor-specific antigens were found, and their expression was significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration.

Spearman correlation analysis between the FPS and drug response in cancer cell lines was performed (|Rs| > 0.25; FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and 58 drugs were found to be IRS-sensitive, while none were IRS-resistant. Interestingly, most of the 58 drugs were proliferation-related pathways, including PI3K/MTOR signaling pathway, ERK MAPK signaling pathway and DNA replication pathway, which is consistent with previous results that proliferation-related drugs are more suitable for patients with high IRS scores (Fig. 5B). We then divided the CTRP database cells into two groups based on the IRS and explored which FDA drugs were available for the two groups of patients.

ZC3H12D exerts crucial functions in immune modulation, and the deregulation of ZC3H12D may contribute to the onset of follicular lymphoma. Tomita et al. pointed out that tumor-bearing lungs enhanced ZC3H12D expression in leukocytes in vitro co-culture system. ZC3H12D recruited to the cell membrane and captures the 3\u2032-untranslated region of naked nonvesicular extracellular IL1\u03b2-mRNA. Then, nex-IL1\u03b2-mRNA was transported to the nucleus which increased anti-apoptotic gene expression, interferon-\u03b3 production and migration activity, resulting in the killing and anti-metastasis of cancer cells in mice. TXNDC5, which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, plays a pivotal role in protein folding and anterograde transport. Importantly, TXNDC5 was found to have abnormally high expression in various tumors, such as lung cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Mo et al. reported that the markedly up-regulated TXNDC5 could promote cell growth, migration, and invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and enhance the chemotherapy sensitivity of cells. Similar findings were reported in the cervical tumor. The high expression of this gene contributes to abnormal angiogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry, and metastasis of cervical tumor cells by down-regulating SERPINF1 and TRAF1 expression. Moreover, TXNDC5 can promote the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 to promote the inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis. IL-6 and IL-8, as members of the interleukin family, play an important role in immune responses such as T cell activation, so the effect of TXNDC5 on the tumor microenvironment needs further study.

According to the results, we identified group 1 as immune active subtype and group 2 as immune resistance subtype. Notably, ZC3H12D and TXNDC5 were observably increased in immune active subtype, which is consistent with our previous conjecture that the expression of both genes is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune response.

Patients with high levels of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells had significantly higher survival rates than all other groups.
