With the increasing incidence of CHD, the harm caused by ICM to human health is becoming more serious. A review summarized that ferroptosis can affect inflammation through immunogenicity and that ferroptosis inhibitors may benefit patients with cardiovascular diseases through their anti-inflammatory effects. However, more research is required to enrich our understanding of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of ICM. This study analyzed different ferroptosis-related DEGs in the ICM and normal groups, and the related functional pathways were preliminarily explored. The imbalance in immune function was inextricably related to the development of ICM. Then, we used the ssGSEA algorithm to analyze the differences in heart tissue immune cells and immune checkpoint gene expression between the ICM and healthy control groups and to analyze the correlation between these cells with hub genes. Finally, we verified the expression of the top five hub genes in PBMCs using qRT-PCR in our clinical samples.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20116, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The potential biological functions of these ferroptosis-related DEGs were assessed through GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. These analyses showed that oxidative stress, the TNF signaling pathway, the FoxO signaling pathway, and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway may play an important role in the ferroptosis process. Studies have shown that oxidative damage caused by oxidative stress was found in the glutamate-induced cell death pathway. Meanwhile, glutamate-induced cytotoxicity can be generated by Ca2+ influx or competitive systemXc-(an important component of ferroptosis) after the activation of glutamate receptors, which then mediates the progression of cell ferroptosis. Liu et al. revealed that the TNF signaling pathway may be a potential mechanism involved in ferroptosis-related genes in intracerebral hemorrhage. Furthermore, another research observed that Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, can significantly reduce the levels of ACSL4 and TNF-\u03b1 in mice after MI and then reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular injury after recanalization. In addition to oxidative stress, the FoxO signaling pathway can promote lipid ROS-mediated cell damage. Kwon et al. found that the metabolic process of polyunsaturated fatty acids can activate the FoxO signaling pathway and then promote the production of ROS. The core role of the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in the innate immune response involves the signal transduction ATP enzyme, which affects atherosclerosis and ICM formation by modulating inflammation that can cause autoimmunity. Wu et al. revealed that the excessive activation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 can reduce the activity of GPX4, reduce the antioxidant capacity of cells, increase lipid peroxidation, increase lipid ROS, and cause ferroptosis.

Li et al. found that ferroptosis can regulate the recruitment of neutrophils to the injured myocardium and that inhibiting ferroptosis can reduce the MI area, improve ventricular systolic function, and reduce adverse ventricular remodeling. Dick et al. found that the depletion of intrinsic cardiac macrophages in the early stage of MI would impair cardiac function. However, monocyte-derived macrophages are involved in adverse ventricular remodeling after MI, and the level of monocytes in the blood is a prognostic marker of ICM. Moreover, a recent study found that CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells were recruited and activated in ischemic myocardial tissue after MI in mice, leading to apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, our analysis showed that multiple immune checkpoints (i.e., PDCDILG2, LAG3, and TIGIT) were also highly expressed in ICM.
