Cells undergoing necroptosis exhibit plasma membrane rupture and overall swelling, including mitochondrial swelling, a distinctive feature from apoptosis. Most reported necrotic pathways involve activating death receptors (DRs) by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which leads to the downstream recruitment of proteins like TNF-receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein kinases 3 (RIPK3), and receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 (RIPK1). As a result of intra-molecular auto and trans-phosphorylation of RIP1/RIP3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) is recruited, leading to membrane pore formation, subsequent disruption of membrane integrity, and ultimately necrosis. Currently, there is growing interest in research to dissect various mechanisms governing necroptosis, with recent studies highlighting the role of necroptosis, particularly RIPK3 pathway-mediated necroptosis, as a promising future treatment strategy for HCM. Zou et al. have presented that a novel necroptotic loop compromised by CB2R serves as a critical driving force of diabetic heart dysfunction by recruiting the coregulator BACH2 (previously unrecognized as a cardiomyocyte transcription factor) to transcriptionally repress the expression of necroptosis.

However, inflammation can impair adaptive responses and worsen cardiac injury. Cardiac macrophages divide into two subpopulations: pro-inflammatory M1 and reparative M2 macrophages. Each plays distinctive roles in cardiac inflammation. M1 macrophages partake in the acute inflammatory response, secreting cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. Conversely, M2 macrophages possess anti-inflammatory properties, producing cytokines such as VEGF and TGF-\u03b2. These cytokines contribute to cardiac fibroblast (CF) activation, angiogenesis, and wound healing. In vivo studies have shown that administration of IL-10 can enhance the expression of M2 marker genes, activate cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), and ultimately lead to improved structural and functional cardiac remodeling. Additionally, M2 macrophages inhibit maladaptive ventricular remodeling and promote cardiomyocyte proliferation and angiogenesis after heart injury in newborn mice. Cardiac M2 macrophages are not only critical for maintaining heart homeostasis but also play a key role in heart repair and regeneration following injury. Given the significant presence of macrophages in cardiac tissue and their essential functions, it is important to further investigate their phenotypes, functions, and dynamics under both normal and disease conditions.

Previous research has shown that JAK2 kinase activation, along with the activation of BAX, caspase-1, and caspase-2 activity, is associated with apoptosis induced by angiotensin II in cultured adult cardiomyocytes. Numerous studies have indicated that inhibiting JAK2 can effectively inhibit apoptosis and its associated signaling pathways, providing potential therapeutic implications for cardiac pathologies. Additionally, JAK2 inhibition has been shown to protect against ischemic and reperfusion injury in rat hearts and prevent the opening of mitochondrial transition pores induced by leptin. The JAK2-V617F somatic mutation, associated with excessive JAK2 activation in myeloproliferative diseases, has also been reported in a suspected case of HCM, highlighting the importance of investigating the role of JAK2 in HCM. The Jak2 gene has previously been identified as a hallmark gene in HCM, as reported in the literature. Studies have demonstrated upregulation of JAK2 transcriptional regulation independent of the JAK2-V617F mutation in confirmed cases of HCM. This upregulation is associated with increased expression of JAK2 and its canonical target, STAT3, in the left ventricle and cardiomyocyte nuclei, implicating dysregulation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in HCM pathogenesis. The upregulation of JAK2 in HCM may be explained by increased bioactivity of IL-6 and oxidative stress frequently observed in this disease. IL-6 and oxidant stress could contribute to dysregulation of JAK2 expression, but additional studies are needed to validate and confirm this hypothesis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 24671, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "BCL2 is a regulatory protein from the BCL family involved in apoptosis control. It can play dual roles as proapoptotic or antiapoptotic. It can act as either a proapoptotic or antiapoptotic protein, exerting opposing effects on the induction or inhibition of apoptosis, respectively. Its primary function is to maintain cell survival and prevent excessive cell death. During necroptosis, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 form a complex called the necrosome, which triggers necroptotic signaling. In this process, BCL2 can have a dual role. On one hand, increased levels of BCL2 can inhibit necrosome formation and suppress necroptosis by sequestering RIPK1 and RIPK3. This anti-necroptotic function of BCL2 is often referred to as \u201cnecroptosis suppression\u201d. On the other hand, under specific circumstances, BCL2 can also promote necroptosis. When caspase-8, a key mediator of apoptosis, is inhibited or not fully activated, it fails to cleave and inactivate RIPK1. Uninhibited RIPK1 then recruits RIPK3 to form the necrosome, leading to necroptotic cell death. BCL2 can facilitate this process by indirectly promoting RIPK1/RIPK3-mediated necroptosis through its anti-apoptotic activity. ErbB2 over-expression also leads to up-regulation of the pro-survival bcl-2 family of proteins in the heart, with an anti-apoptotic shift in the balance of pro-survival bcl-xL and apoptotic bcl-xS proteins. Therefore, BCL2 acts as a critical regulator in the decision-making process between apoptosis and necroptosis. Depending on the context and cellular conditions, BCL2 can either inhibit apoptosis or modulate the switch towards necroptosis. The interplay between BCL2 and the signaling pathways governing apoptosis and necroptosis is still an active area of research, and the precise mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully understood. Previous studies have highlighted the significant contribution of BCL2 in the context of cardiac hypertrophy. Inhibitors of BCL2, such as LY294002 (which inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway) and Venetoclax (a selective BCL2 inhibitor), have been shown to possess protective effects against cardiac hypertrophy by inhibiting BCL2. The study highlights the role of BCL2 as a key downstream effector in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cardiomyocyte survival and promoting cardiac hypertrophy. This study suggests the potential involvement of BCL2 in HCM development. However, additional comprehensive research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms by which BCL2 contributes to HCM.

It facilitates the transfer of single electrons from cytoplasmic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) across the plasma membrane to external molecular oxygen. CYBB is expressed in various cell types, including eosinophils, neutrophils, B lymphocytes, and other cell lineages. Its main function is to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to cytokines and stimuli such as IFN-\u03b3, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and TNF-\u03b1. Indeed, CYBB plays a critical role as the central component of the microbicidal oxidase system in phagocytes. It is responsible for generating ROS involved in microbe killing. Importantly, CYBB is not limited to hematopoietic cell lineages such as neutrophils and eosinophils but is also expressed in non-hematopoietic cell lineages, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes. This highlights the broad involvement of CYBB-mediated ROS production in various cellular processes beyond immune responses. CYBB upregulation in hypertrophy has been proposed as a potential diagnostic biomarker for HCM and its involvement in maladaptive processes. CYBB activation in dietary obesity and metabolic disorders contributes to cardiac oxidative stress, abnormal redox signaling, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Metabolic signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as common pathogenic mechanisms in patients with HCM based on previous studies. Specifically, the impact of CYBB on cardiac energetics and/or the progression of ventricular dysfunction has been reported. However, there is limited research on the role of CYBB in regulating altered cardiac energetics and mitochondrial dysfunction in HCM, as highlighted by the existing literature. Previous studies have shown that mice with a global deficiency in CYBB expression exhibit partial protection against the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) following active immunization. However, there is limited research on the role of CYBB in modulating the immune microenvironment in HCM.
