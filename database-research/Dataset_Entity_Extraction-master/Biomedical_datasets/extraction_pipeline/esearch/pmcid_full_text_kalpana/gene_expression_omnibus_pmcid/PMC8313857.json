Even though more than 100 biomarkers for sepsis prognosis were evaluated, prediction of patient outcomes in sepsis continues to be driven by clinical signs because of unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity of these biomarkers. This study aimed to elucidate the key candidate genes involved in sepsis response and explore their downstream effects based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The dataset GSE63042 with sepsis outcome information was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and then consensus WGCNA was conducted. We identified the hub gene SDF4 (stromal cell derived factor 4) from the M6 module, which was significantly associated with mortality. Subsequently, two datasets (GSE54514 and E-MTAB-4421) and cohort validation (n=89) were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to build a prediction model and the combined score resulting in a satisfactory prognosis value (area under the ROC curve=0.908). The model was subsequently tested by another sepsis cohort (n=70, ROC= 0.925). We next demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress tended to be more severe in patients PBMCs with negative outcomes compared to those with positive outcomes and SDF4 was related to this phenomenon. In addition, our results indicated that adenovirus-mediated Sdf4 overexpression attenuated ER stress in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice lung. In summary, our study indicates that incorporation of SDF4 can improve clinical parameters predictive value for the prognosis of sepsis, and decreased expression levels of SDF4 contributes to excessive ER stress, which is associated with worsened outcomes, whereas overexpression of SDF4 attenuated such activation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1917, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Background", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1928, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Sepsis, a syndrome of physiologic, pathologic, and biochemical abnormalities induced by infection, is a major cause of mortality among critical ICU patients.

In addition to rapid diagnosis, one of the clinical dilemmas that we faced is that once a sepsis diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment is taken, it is often difficult to distinguish between a positive and a negative prognosis. In the past thirty years, more than 100 markers have been evaluated for sepsis prognosis, including cytokine/chemokine biomarkers, cell and receptor biomarkers, coagulation biomarkers, vascular endothelial damage biomarkers, vasodilation biomarkers, organ dysfunction biomarkers, and acute-phase protein biomarkers.

To identify the combined signature, we performed a logistic regression analysis. Among all characteristics, cancer, chronic kidney disease, APACHE II score, SOFA score, and SDF4 expression levels revealed statistical significance (P < 0.1) in univariate analysis.

Cab45C is reported to be a cytosolic splice variant and participates in Ca2+-induced amylase secretion. Cab45G is localized to the Golgi lumen, required for Ca2+-dependent cargo sorting at the trans-Golgi network, and can regulate impairment elicited by ethanol or UV. Cab45S, is related to ER Ca2+ signaling and ER stress response genes. Therefore, we speculated that the underlying mechanism of SDF4 is associated with ER function. Firstly, PBMCs were observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Those patients with negative outcomes showed more severe swelling of the ER and ribosome degranulation ( Figure\u00a05B ). After the expression level of SDF4 was verified ( Figure\u00a05C ), we next determined the expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, and ATF6 in our cohort, which are key genes in signaling cascades to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins. We found that patients who died within 28 days tended to express GRP78 more highly (1.29 \u00b1 0.13 versus 1.03 \u00b1 0.06,  Figure\u00a05D ). Moreover, we evaluated the correlation between SFD4 expression and GRP78 expression in PBMCs and found that GRP78 expression was negatively correlated with SDF4 ( Figure\u00a05E ). Similar results were observed for the correlation between SDF4 and ATF6 expression ( Figure\u00a05F ). In addition, our data showed that GRP78, CHOP, and ATF6 were over-expressed in patients with severe sepsis that led to death via calculating the mean fluorescence intensity in flow cytometry ( Figures\u00a05G\u2013L ), which was further verified by immunofluorescence ( Figures\u00a05M\u2013O ) in another cohort.

A recent study has revealed that sepsis is a complex and dynamic syndrome with great heterogeneity. Therefore, co-expression network analysis was employed in the current study to mine the hub gene and explore the underlying mechanisms of sepsis responses in the current study. Expression data of 28 sepsis non-survivors and 78 sepsis survivors were used for WGCNA analysis. Through WGCNA, we divided all genes into 11 separate modules and found that the M6 module was indicative of sepsis outcome. SDF4 was then screened out satisfying three criteria: 1) DEGs; 2) GS > 0.2, MM > 0.8; 3) the 20 highest MCC value, followed by validation in both two datasets and clinical cohorts.

Meaningful definitions of sepsis severity are supposed to capture a subset of patients where severe physiological derangements led to a substantially great mortality risk. In addition, more than 100 biomarkers have been evaluated for sepsis prognosis in the last few decades. Regardless of this, no gold standard for prognosis yet exists and clinicians still rely on a number of traditional biomarkers to discriminate between patients with positive and negative outcomes. Reportedly, PCT, CRP, lactate levels, and SOFA scores have a moderate predictive value in sepsis prognosis, while prognosis accuracy depends much on multiple assessments and measurements throughout disease progression. Our findings showed that SDF4 expression level was significantly lower in non-survivors compared to survivors and that its prediction value is superior to that of CRP and PCT, equal to lactate and the APACHE II score, and inferior to the SOFA score. As a combination of several sepsis biomarkers might be more effective, we applied a multivariable logistic regression approach and the combined score turned out to be a satisfactory predictor with an AUC of 0.908.

Previous DNA methylation analysis revealed that the promoter region of SDF4 was hypomethylated in porcine mammary epithelial cells faced with Escherichia coli challenge, suggesting the potential effect of SDF4 in sepsis. Alternative splicing of its encoded protein, Cab45, produces three different isoforms: Cab45C, Cab45G, and Cab45S. Cab45C is reported to be a cytosolic splice variant and participates in Ca2+-induced amylase secretion. Cab45G is localized to the Golgi lumen, required for Ca2+-dependent cargo sorting at the trans-Golgi network, and can regulate impairment elicited by ethanol or UV. Cab45S, a secreted variant of Cab45, can inhibit ER stress and apoptosis via GRP78/Bip and can promote cell proliferation through inhibition of Ca2+ signaling in tumors. The downregulation of apoptosis was also observed in neurons when SDF4 was overexpressed. We observed that SDF4 was a protective factor for sepsis patients in both the validation datasets and cohort. KEGG pathway analysis also revealed protein processes in the ER as the most enriched pathway in the M6 module, so we shifted our focus to ER dysfunction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37103, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The ER is a vital intracellular organelle in eukaryotic cells, which is constructed of a continuous membrane system of tubules and sheets. The ER plays a major role in protein translocation, folding, post-translational modifications, and transportation to the Golgi body, commonly considered as a protein folding factory. The ER also serves a role in calcium storage and lipid metabolism. Accumulated evidence supports that the ER is altered in septic pathology and ER stress is involved in the progression of sepsis, which is marked by the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins. ER stress not only contributes to abnormal lymphocyte apoptosis, but also impairs beneficial autophagy activity in septic mice. In addition, it was reported that ER stress can modulate the NF-\u03baB/I\u03baB and HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathways in LPS-induced lung inflammation. Nevertheless, there is little research focusing on the relation between ER stress and sepsis prognosis. In the current study, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly overexpressed in non-survivors compared to survivors, which was confirmed in both flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. And to further verify our hypothesis, we established the mice CLP model and found that ER stress gradually increased within 24 hours after surgery, accompanied by the decreasing of Sdf4. And overexpression of Sdf4 by intratracheally injecting recombinant adenovirus attenuated such activation. In mild or temporary ER stress, this signaling cascade can restore the cell to homeostasis. Conversely, if stress is long-term or excessive and cellular function is compromised, apoptosis is initiated involving the transcription factor C/EPB homologous protein (CHOP).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38818, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, using WGCNA analysis, our study identified SDF4 as a biomarker of sepsis prognosis, and a prediction model was established based on SDF4 expression levels and clinical characteristics. Then, the mechanism was speculated and preliminarily verified in sepsis patients and CLP mice. Upon inflammatory overload in severe sepsis, the SDF4 expression level was decreased, leading to an ER stress signaling cascade. ER stress beyond the regulation level of cells results in compromised cellular function, which gives rise to a worsened outcome. Nevertheless, the study also has some limitations. Firstly, the performance of the combined score for sepsis outcome prediction requires an evaluation in a larger multicenter and prospective study to compare with existing biomarkers. Secondly, we only followed up for 28 days but did not confirm the impact of SDF4 expression and ER stress levels on the long-term mortality of septic patients.
