Crystals can trigger a wide range of kidney injuries that lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, renal colic, or nephrocalcinosis. Calcium oxalate constitutes approximately 80% of kidney stones; generally, elevated urine oxalate concentrations above the supersaturation limit caused by various conditions will lead to calcium oxalate crystallization, crystal deposition in renal tissue and finally, kidney damage evolving to renal failure.

We observed that a group of tubule cells transitioned into a proliferative state under injury insult, which indicated that a vital process modulates renal self-repair. By exploring the factors regulating this process, we identified a group of macrophages that contribute to renal repair in the setting of kidney crystal injury. Consistent with the findings of previous studies, our work illustrated those immune cells, especially macrophages, infiltrate after crystal-induced tubule injury. Among them, a transcriptionally distinct macrophage subset increased in number and percentage with crystal damage progression. These cells express the canonical M2 macrophage marker Mrc1 but distinctly secrete the cytokine IGF1, a polypeptide growth factor that plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism and survival. Cellular interaction analysis revealed the significant information flow of IGF1 signal from Mrc1+ macrophages to injured and proliferating tubule cells, indicating that these cells play essential roles in tissue repair and kidney restoration in response to crystal insult. A previous study revealed that IGF1 production from alveolar macrophages suppresses endogenous inflammatory signals via the upregulation of phagocytosis by alveolar epithelial cells. In our work, IGF1 supplementation enhanced the regeneration capacity of renal tubule cells in glyoxylate-treated mice, ultimately leading to decreased inflammatory and fibrotic responses and decreased macrophage invasion. Conversely, IGF1 blockade exacerbates injury by limiting tubular proliferation and exacerbating inflammation and fibrosis. IGF1/Akt/RB signaling plays a role in enhancing the G1/S transition of the cell cycle and thus promotes tubule cell proliferation. Combined with findings from integrated analysis of other scRNA-seq data on sorted kidney myeloid cells with unilateral IRI insult. Based on the markers identified in our data, we observed the conservation of this group of Mrc1+ Igf1+ macrophages in IRI-challenged kidneys.
