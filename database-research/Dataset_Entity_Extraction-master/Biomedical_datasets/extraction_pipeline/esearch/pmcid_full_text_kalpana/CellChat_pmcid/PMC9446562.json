We found fibroblasts had an extensive communication network with other clusters and interacted with synovial macrophages through EGF signaling pathway via analysis of cell-cell communication between synovial cells. HBEGF, ligand to EGF signaling pathway, was highly expressed by a subset of fibroblasts and macrophages, and EGFR, receptor to EGF signaling pathway, was highly expressed by fibroblasts and meniscus cells. Moreover, HBEGF was downregulated under RA state and it had an increase after classical treatment. We then defined fibroblasts with high expression of HBEGF as HBEGF+ fibroblasts. In addition, we also found that HBEGF+ fibroblasts highly expressed CRTAC1, ITGB8, SCARA5, THBS4, and ITGBL1, genes relative to encoding extracellular matrix proteins and engaged in positive regulation of cell migration and motility, cellular component movement, and cell growth by GO enrichment analysis.

It is characterized by chronic synovitis and progressive articular damage. Accurate assessment of RA process has potential to provide optimal treatment strategies as current clinical biomarkers are unable to monitory the disease activity and a part of patients with negative inflammatory tests still have active disease. Moreover, classification of RA synovium is possible to offer sensitive predictors of RA progress. A series of studies have demonstrated that increasing numbers of mononuclear phagocytes, synovial fibroblasts, B cells, and T cells participated in RA progression and caused destruction of articular cartilage and bone. However, few researchers paid attention to the roles of synovial cells in RA remission. Recently, with the help of single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology, tissue resident macrophages that contributed to the remission of RA were found in synovium. In human, the population of MerTKposCD206pos synovial tissue macrophages was higher in RA remission synovium compared to active RA synovium. Moreover, MerTKposCD206pos synovial tissue macrophages showed the biofunction including mediator profile resolution and repair responses. In mice, locally renewing Cx3cr1+ tissue-resident macrophages form a tight-junction barrier to protect intra-articular structures from inflammatory reaction.

However, most of these researches concentrated on fibroblast subclasses in promoting inflammation in arthritis. Fibroblast subsets that communicate with MerTKposCD206pos synovial tissue macrophages and engage in tissue repair have not been reported in detail. Furthermore, because of the usefulness of a detailed description of fibroblast subclasses in addressing the mechanisms of RA remission and monitoring RA activity, we hypothesized that there is a distinct population of fibroblasts producing an active role in RA remission.

However, pervious literatures had pointed out that the importance of the ErbB family pathway in chronic pain and activating EGF singling pathway resulted in deterioration of RA. For instance, injecting HBEGF into the paw of mice caused painful mechanical hypersensitivity and severe pain and blocking the ErbB receptor could alleviate RA pain and joint inflammation. In vivo, there are two different structural forms of HBEGF including proHBEGF (transmembrane protein) and sHBEGF (soluble protein). proHBEGF is a precursor for sHBEGF and can be cleaved at the plasma membrane to yield sHBEGF. proHBEGF takes part in juxtacrine activity and sHBEGF engages in paracrine activity. From scRNA-seq data, we noticed that HBEGF+ fibroblasts accounted for a small part comparing to the huge amount of HBEGF\u2212 fibroblasts.

So it is possible that the different spatial location between HEBGF+ fibroblasts and HEBGF\u2212 fibroblasts in some ways prevents proHBEGF from contacting with EGFR and activating HBEGF\u2212 fibroblasts. Moreover, small quantities of HBEGF+ fibroblasts limit the production of sHBEGF and in other ways inhibit the interaction of sHBEGF with HEBGF\u2212 fibroblasts.
