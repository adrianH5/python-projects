GABAergic neurons (GABA) (Clusters 0, 6, 15, 13, and 18) were characterized by the expression of Glutamate Decarboxylase 2 (Gad2), which encodes glutamate decarboxylase and is widely distributed in the axon terminus of inhibitory neurons (Supplementary Figure S3H). The expression of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) was characteristic of DaNs (Cluster 17), which encode rate-limiting enzymes in catecholamine synthesis and are involved in the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine (Supplementary Figure S3I). Some were uncommon, such as N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 4 (Ndst4) (markers of deep neurons), which was highly expressed in Cluster 9; B230323A14Rik (a long noncoding RNA in neurons), which was highly expressed in Cluster 8; and Cadherin-23 (Cdh23) (involved in the differentiation of neurons), which was highly expressed in Cluster 16 (Supplementary Figures 3J\u2013L).

Initially, we found significant specific DEGs and PD risk genes enrichment in microglia. In addition, the cell\u2013cell communication relationship between microglia and other cells was investigated in detail, and PD-related signaling factors and L-R pairs were identified. Finally, trajectory analyses in the microglial populations identified that inflammatory responses are activated with trajectory, and Nfe2l2 and Runx1 may be the major triggers of inflammatory signaling in PD. Taken together, our work at least partially supports the changes in microglial state and genes in the SN of MPTP model mice, and we hope that this study can provide references for the pathogenesis of PD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 44971, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Data availability statement", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 44999, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material.
