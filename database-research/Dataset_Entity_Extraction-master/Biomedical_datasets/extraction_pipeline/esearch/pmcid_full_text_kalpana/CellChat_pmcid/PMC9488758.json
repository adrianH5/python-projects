Here, we sequenced the spinal cord of a mouse model of severe SMA using single-cell RNA sequencing. Over 20,000 cells, 10 cell types, 29 subtypes and their differentially expressed genes were identified. Overall, cell-cell communication in SMA is substantially reduced.

Its pathology is characterized by motor neuron degeneration in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and necrosis of the neuromuscular junction. Death in patients with SMA is due to respiratory failure caused by autonomic muscle denervation. Humans have a backup gene for SMN1, that is, survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2, MIM 601627), which can produce a small amount of functional SMN proteins due to mis-splicing but cannot compensate for SMN1 loss. Direct supplementation of SMN proteins or the correction of SMN2 splicing is the main approach used for SMA treatment. In recent years, three effective drugs for SMA treatment have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, namely nusinersen, risdiplam, and abeparvovec-xioi. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide, and risdiplam is a small-molecule compound; these two drugs correct SMN2 splicing; thus, increasing SMN protein levels.

Its most well-understood function is to form a complex with the Gemin protein to participate in spliceosome assembly. Another essential function of SMN is to participate in messenger RNA transport in motor neuron axons. SMN influences the SMA condition in a dose-dependent manner. In general, the more the copies of the SMN2 gene, the milder the clinical phenotype of SMA. In addition, several modifiers affect the clinical phenotype of patients with SMA. Patients carrying the c.859G>C mutation on exon 7 and A-44G mutation on intron 6 of SMN2 had a mild phenotype; the c.859G>C mutation creates an SF2/ASF-dependent exonic splice enhancer, and the A-44G mutation disrupts the HuR-dependent intronic splicing silencer.

Specific depletion of SMN in motor neurons causes limited dyskinesia rather than complete SMA. Although a specific increase of SMN protein in motor neurons improves the pathological features and motor functions of SMA mice, the improvement in mouse lifespan is limited. Glial cells are one of the most common cell types in the central nervous system (CNS), and their primary function is to maintain spinal cord homeostasis and nourish neurons. As a result, glial cells are the most likely to be involved in the non-cell-autonomous death of motor neurons. Astrocytes in SMA undergo morphological and functional changes that affect calcium homeostasis, microRNA formation, and protein secretion, reducing communication with motor neurons. Surprisingly, SMN-specific supplementation in astrocytes did not prevent motor neuron death in SMA mice, but it did extend their lifespan. In addition, other cell types in the spinal cord, such as vascular cells, are also disrupted in SMA.

Specifically, cells with <200 detected genes and those with a high detection rate (10%) of mitochondrial gene expression were filtered out. To further remove potential doublets in our data, cells with the number of detected genes >4000 were also filtered out. Additionally, we removed a cluster with a high detection rate of the ribosome (>30%). In addition, genes that were detected in <10 cells were filtered out before further analyses.
