Naphthalenedione, present in numerous plants, is being explored as a potential medicine for MS due to its immunomodulatory properties. However, its effects on lymphocytes can vary depending on factors such as the specific compound, concentration, and experimental conditions. In this study, we aim to explore the therapeutic potential of 2-bromo-1,4-naphthalenedione (BrQ), a derivative of naphthalenedione, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. We observed that mice treated with BrQ exhibited reduced severity of EAE symptoms, including lower clinical scores, decreased leukocyte infiltration, and less extensive demyelination in central nervous system. Furthermore, it was noted that BrQ does not directly affect the remyelination process. Through cell-chat analysis based on bulk RNA-seq data, coupled with validation of flow analysis, we discovered that BrQ significantly promotes the expansion of CD8+ T cells and their interactions with other immune cells in peripheral immune system in EAE mice. Subsequent CD8+ T cell depletion experiments confirmed that BrQ alleviates EAE in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Mechanistically, expanded CD8+ cells were found to selectively reduce antigen-specific CD4+ cells and subsequently inhibit Th1 and Th17 cell development in vivo, ultimately leading to relief from EAE. In summary, our findings highlight the crucial role of BrQ in modulating the pathogenesis of MS, suggesting its potential as a novel drug candidate for treating MS and other autoimmune diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1881, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Information", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1907, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12974-024-03172-x.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1999, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2012, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the predominant chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS), with a global impact on affecting nearly 3\u00a0million individuals. Typically appearing between the ages of 20 and 40, MS is the primary nontraumatic cause of neurologic disability among young adults. It disproportionately affects women, with a ratio of approximately two to one. Common symptoms of MS include limb weakness or sensory loss, ataxia, visual disturbances, spasticity, fatigue, pain, and cognitive deficits. Widely recognized today, MS is believed to stem from a complex interplay of multiple genetic, epigenetic, and environmental risk factors. Its pathogenesis unfolds through a series of pathological processes, beginning with immune system activation, followed by the infiltration of immune cells across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), demyelination, gliosis, and neuroaxonal degeneration. These cascading events culminate in the disruption of neuronal signaling, giving rise to neurologic syndromes and physical disability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3070, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Presently, clinical interventions primarily target the peripheral inflammatory processes that initiate during the early stages of MS. This treatment spectrum includes a variety of medications such as beta-interferons, teriflunomide, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, mitoxantrone, ocrelizumab, and alemtuzumab. Recognizing the characteristic immune dysregulation observed in MS, which prompts the infiltration of autoreactive immune cells into the CNS and precipitates neurodegeneration, supplementary medications like fingolimod and natalizumab have been developed to further curb immune cell infiltration. Although these therapies have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating disease severity, they only partially impede MS progression, falling short of achieving full remission. Furthermore, due to the lack of specificity in current treatments, the more potent medications for MS often entail a heightened risk of serious adverse events. For instance, adverse events associated with oral fingolimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis include bradycardia, atrioventricular conduction block, elevated liver enzyme levels, macular edema, and mild hypertension. Similarly, natalizumab, along with other immunotherapeutic drugs, is linked to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

As shown in the volcano diagram (Fig.\u00a03A), we identified 2347 differentially expressed genes compared to the vehicle group (fold change\u2009>\u20092, p\u2009<\u20090.05), among which 1344 genes were upregulated, and 1003 genes were downregulated. Further GO (Gene ontology) enrichment analysis revealed that the gene categories significantly affected by BrQ in the dLN lymphocytes cells were associated with activation of immune response, activation of innate immune response, response to interferon-beta, cellular response to interferon-beta and positive regulation of defense response (Fig.\u00a03B).

Consistent with the above GO and KEGG results, the GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) analysis also showed that activation of immune response, cytokine production, innate immune response and positive regulation of defense response were upregulated, indicating that BrQ extensively activates immune cells in the dLN (Fig.\u00a03D-G). We then employed CellChat analysis to investigate which immune cells are activated and contribute to alleviating EAE clinical symptoms. The results showed that activation of CD8+ T cells was most pronounced in peripheral dLN lymphocytes, primarily collected from the axillary, lateral axillary, and superficial inguinal regions, in BrQ-treated EAE mice.

Next, we aimed to explore the role of CD8+ T cells in BrQ-mediated alleviation of EAE clinical symptoms. We used a CD8-specific monoclonal antibody (CD8 mAb) to deplete CD8+ T cells after immunization. Injection on EAE day 3 and day 4 rapidly depleted CD8+ T cells, maintaining a 71.2% clearance rate even after 6 days (almost complete clearance of CD8+ T cells would lead to nearly complete mortality in mice during the progression of EAE, particularly at the peak of the disease).

Despite the introduction of various disease-modifying therapies in recent years, a complete clinical cure for MS remains elusive, with currently available treatments only capable of slowing disease progression. Consequently, it is urgently needed to develop safe and efficacious drugs targeting multiple sclerosis. In our study, we observed that mice treated with 2-bromo-1,4-naphthalenedione (BrQ), a derivative of naphthalenedione, exhibited reduced severity of EAE symptoms, including lower clinical scores, decreased leukocyte infiltration, and less extensive demyelination in the CNS. Through comprehensive analysis of cell interactions using bulk RNA-seq data and validation through flow analysis, we discovered that BrQ significantly enhances the expansion of CD8+ T cells and their interactions with other immune cells in peripheral immune tissue in EAE mice. Further experiments involving CD8+ T cell depletion confirmed that BrQ alleviates EAE in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that expanded CD8+ T cells selectively reduce antigen-specific CD4+ cells, subsequently inhibiting the development of Th1 and Th17 cells in vivo, ultimately leading to relief from EAE.

Both in MS patients and the EAE animal model, clonally expanded CD8+ T cell populations effectively reduce disease severity by actively suppressing autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Conversely, depletion of CD8+ T cells exacerbates EAE symptoms. Moreover, nonclassical MHC class Ib\u2013restricted CD8+ T cell (HLA-E in humans and Qa-1b in mice), CNS-specific CD8+ T, CD8+CD25+Foxp3+, CD8+CD44+Ly49+, CD8+CD28\u2212, CD8+CD122+ and KIR+CD8+ T cells have been suggested to have a regulatory function. In contrast, IL-17\u00a0A secreting CD8+ T cells and myelin antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were demonstrated to support EAE symptoms. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of CD8+ T cell subpopulations, none of the twenty-three disease-modifying therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was specifically developed to target CD8+ T cells for treating MS. Although glatiramer acetate mitigates EAE to some extent by inducing Qa-1-restricted regulatory CD8+ T cells. Notably, CD8+ T cells were identified as primary signaling mediators in the peripheral immune system of BrQ treated EAE mice. Importantly, we observed that BrQ activates and amplifies CD8+ T cells within the spleen, dLN and blood, leading to a significant reduction in the MOG35\u2009\u2212\u200955-reactive CD4+ T cell subset in EAE mice. CD8+ T cell depletion confirmed the efficacy of BrQ was exerted in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed the activation of 4-1BB signaling in CD8+ T cell after BrQ treatment, while the agonistic anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibody can suppress antigen-specific CD4+ T cells by activating CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis animal models. We inferred that BrQ largely promotes the proliferation of CD8+ T cells by activating 4-1BB. Likewise, despite reduced CD8+ T cell levels in the blood on day 15 in EAE mice, asymptomatic BrQ-treated mice remained symptom-free even after BrQ administration cessation for 1 month (unpublished observation). We speculated that expanded CD8+ T cell not only exerts immunosuppressive effects but also potentially develop into antigen-specific memory T cell. Thus, BrQ may represent the first small molecule candidate drug capable of specific increasing CD8+ T cells with suppressive function, thereby providing novel therapeutic strategies for EAE and other autoimmune diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 48811, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It has been well established that activation of peripheral autoreactive effector CD4+ T cells mediate disease progression and severity. Moreover, both IL-17\u00a0A-producing Th17 cells and IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells are recognized as pivotal players in driving the pathogenesis of EAE. Upon activation, CD8+ T cells produce substantial amounts of IFN-\u03b3, allowing them to modulate autoimmune responses by suppressing Th1 and Th17 cells in an IFN-\u03b3-dependent manner. Our results showed that BrQ boosts IFN-\u03b3 production in CD8+ T cells in vivo, along with increased serum levels of IFN-\u03b3. As reported, IFN-\u03b3 deficiency exacerbates EAE. The function of IFN-\u03b3 in regulating Th1 and Th17 responses have been well elucidated. First, IFN-\u03b3 limits Th1 responses by converting IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells into IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells. Secondly, IFN-\u03b3 directly inhibits naive T cells from differentiating into Th17 cells. Instead, the inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 signaling enhances pathogenic Th17 effector cell development, worsening autoimmunity. IFN-\u03b3 also indirectly inhibits the pathogenic Th17 response by inducing dendritic cells to secrete IL-27. Thirdly, coculture with activated CD8+ T cells markedly enhances apoptosis of Th1 and Th17 cells in vitro. Additionally, activated CD8+ T cells can directly eliminate effector/autoreactive CD4+ cells by releasing cytolytic granules like granzyme B and perforin, leading to direct lysis. Furthermore, our research supports these findings by demonstrating that BrQ restrains Th1/Th17 cell development in both peripheral dLN and CNS in vivo.

Accordingly, we next verified whether BrQ could directly promote myelin regeneration in vivo and in vitro. Our study indicated that BrQ does not stimulate OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes that remyelinate axons and myelin sheaths for remyelination in vitro, nor does it have a direct effect on remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model. We speculated that BrQ appears to modulate EAE pathology through an immunosuppressive effect rather than by directly promoting myelin regeneration.

Thirdly, although our findings indicate that BrQ promotes the proliferation of CD8+ T cells indirectly in vitro. However, it remains uncertain whether BrQ is metabolized into other substances in vivo or undergoes metabolic transformation by intestinal microorganisms into different products, directly promoting the proliferation of CD8+ T cells or alternatively exerting a protective effect on EAE by modulating intestinal immune cells. Lastly, the timing of BrQ\u2019s effectiveness on EAE varies at different disease stages.
