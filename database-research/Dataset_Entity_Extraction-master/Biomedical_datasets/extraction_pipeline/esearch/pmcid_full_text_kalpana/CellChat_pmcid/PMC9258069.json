The clinical information of 80 UM patients was collected from the TCGA database for the overall survival analysis. The results confirmed that the mRNA expression of these gene pairs was tightly correlated with the survival rate of UM (Fig.\u00a05 A-B and Fig. S5). The decreased expression of the SPP1 signaling pathway, including the ligand SPP1 and the receptor CD44, was closely associated with poor overall survival in UM (Fig. 5 A), whereas the decreased expression of the MHC-I pathway, including HLA-C and CD8A, predicted a better survival rate (Fig. 5 B). We further investigated the contribution of each cell cluster to the overall elevation of SPP1 and CD44. The single-cell analysis showed that the attenuation of the SPP1 signaling pathway originated from the decrease in the expression of the pathway gene in melanocytes (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, while the mRNA level of HLA-C was downregulated in melanocytes, its expression in immune cells was upregulated (Fig. 5 D), suggesting dysfunction of the immune response. The signaling gene pairs were also validated in UM samples. We obtained UM tissues (Fig. 5 E) and checked the gene expression of signaling gene pairs, such as SPP1-CD44, HLA-C-CD8A, in tumor and adjacent normal tissues.
