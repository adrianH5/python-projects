These cells were distinctly visualized in a t-SNE plot, where they were further subdivided into 25 unique subgroups, as illustrated in  Figure\u00a03A . Subsequently, by employing specific marker genes for cell annotation, we meticulously differentiated these cells into three DC subtypes: cDCs, tDCs, and pDCs. Each subtype, with its unique features, is concisely represented in  Figure\u00a03B .

This finding points towards the dynamic and complex nature of DC cell differentiation. Further examining the number and percentage of DC cells among different patients, as shown in  Figures\u00a04D, E , we uncovered significant heterogeneity. This variability suggests that DC cells may assume diverse roles in different individuals, highlighting the complexity of their functions in the immune response. Subsequently, we compared the cell cycle distribution of the dendritic cell subpopulations, presented in  Figures\u00a04F, G . This comparison revealed that pDCs had a higher proportion of cells in the G2/M and S phases, indicating a more active cell cycle status, whereas cDCs and tDCs predominantly occupied the G1 phase. Delving deeper, our analysis, as demonstrated in  Figure\u00a04H , focused on the expression patterns of various transcription factors across dendritic cell types. A detailed examination unveiled distinct expression trends for transcription factors such as IRF1, NFKB1, and RELB within the DC subgroups. Notably, IRF1 expression was markedly higher in cDC cells compared to pDC cells. NFKB1 exhibited relatively high expression in both cell types, albeit more pronounced in cDCs. Conversely, an increased expression of RELB was observed predominantly in pDC cells. Additionally, POLR2A was found to be highly expressed across all dendritic cell types, particularly in cDC cells, which might indicate its broad and pivotal role in dendritic cell functions. These results shed light on potential transcriptional regulatory differences between dendritic cell subgroups, which are integral to comprehending their distinct functions in immune responses.

Next, we analyzed the correlation between tDC and pDC marker genes and these DEGs, selecting genes with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.4 and a p-value less than 0.05. Based on these genes, univariate Cox regression analysis identified 46 genes with significant prognostic value for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), of which 28 were risk factors and 18 were protective factors ( Figure\u00a07B ). To further narrow down the gene pool, we employed Lasso regression analysis and selected 13 genes at the optimal cutoff value (lambda=0.0735) ( Figure\u00a07C ).

Initially, we identified factors significantly affecting the prognosis of ESCC patients through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, combined with clinical features and risk scoring ( Figures\u00a08A, B ). The analysis indicated that pathological staging (Stage) and risk scoring are important factors affecting prognosis. Based on these findings, we constructed a nomogram ( Figure\u00a08C ) combining risk scores and pathological staging to predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival probabilities. This tool aims to provide a quantitative method to assist physicians in treatment decision-making, estimating patients\u2019 survival probabilities by calculating a total score for each patient. To validate the predictive accuracy of this nomogram, we plotted calibration curves ( Figure\u00a08D ) to assess the concordance between the predicted and actual survival probabilities.

These cells adeptly capture exogenous antigens and present them to lymphocytes, such as T and B cells, epitomizing one of the most potent cells in triggering the adaptive immune response. Consequently, the presence of DCs at immune challenge sites is essential for mounting an effective immune response. A significant area of current research is how different tumor microenvironments influence DCs in aspects like their development, functionality, and migration, thereby modulating the robustness of the adaptive immune response. Given their heterogeneity, DCs are classified into various subtypes, each with distinct functionalities. In our study, we categorize DCs into three subtypes - cDC, tDC, and pDC - in alignment with established literature.

These findings provide cell cycle-related insights for further exploration of the roles of DCs in tumor development and immune responses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 52813, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on six DC marker genes (CCDC50, ETV5, LAMP5, NEURL3, SDS, CR2), we constructed a robust prognostic feature set that can reliably predict the prognosis and efficacy of immunotherapy in ESCC. CCDC50, a gene encoding a human protein, has been explored in multiple studies for its primary functions and mechanisms. Its increased expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been linked to tumor development stages and extranodal site numbers. Additionally, CCDC50 promotes tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting c-Myc ubiquitin-mediated degradation and also contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma through the Ras/Foxo4 signaling pathway. ETV5, belonging to the ETS family of transcription factors, is a key factor in cancer research, recognized for its role in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression. In neuroblastoma, ETV5 drives tumor aggressiveness through transcriptional regulation mediated by activated ALK mutations and is influenced by the MAPK signaling pathway, a mechanism consistent across different cancer types. Moreover, ETV5\u2019s oncogenic role in colorectal cancer involves enhancing tumor proliferation and affecting the G1/S transition in the cell cycle, primarily by regulating p21 expression. LAMP5, a lysosome-associated membrane protein, plays a crucial role in leukemia and gastric cancer. In leukemia, particularly mixed-lineage leukemia rearrangements (MLL-r), LAMP5 is a direct target of the oncogenic MLL fusion protein, and its reduction significantly inhibits leukemia cell growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. In gastric cancer, the upregulation of LAMP5 in metastatic tissues is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and alterations in apoptosis and the cell cycle, indicating its significant role in metastasis formation and potential as a drug development target.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 54699, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, our systematic analysis of dendritic cell heterogeneity in ESCC has identified that tDCs and pDCs can significantly impact the prognosis of ESCC patients. Utilizing marker genes from these two cell groups, we have developed a robust prognostic model that can accurately predict the prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy in ESCC. This model could bring new insights into the treatment of ESCC patients. However, we must acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly, as our study relies on existing public data, we lack comprehensive experimental validation of the key genes in our model. This might limit our understanding of the roles these genes play in ESCC. In light of these limitations, our future research will focus on more extensive cellular and animal experiments. These studies will enable us to more directly validate the roles these genes play in the development of ESCC, particularly regarding the functions of dendritic cells. Through these experiments, we hope to provide stronger evidence to support our findings and further deepen our understanding of the heterogeneity of dendritic cells in ESCC and their role in TME.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 55847, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Data availability statement", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 55875, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
