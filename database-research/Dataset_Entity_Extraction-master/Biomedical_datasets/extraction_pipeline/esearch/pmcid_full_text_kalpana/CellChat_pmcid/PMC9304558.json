However, this cannot fully reveal the transcriptional features of VSMCs in BBA. Hence, we re-grouped the VSMCs by their original identity (BBA-derived or IA-derived) ( Figure\u00a02A ). VSMCs from BBAs showed only a small fraction in the UMAP compared to their counterparts in IA. By comparing the enriched gene in VSMCs between IA and BBA, we found that the VSMCs showed significantly discrete gene enrichment patterns. VSMC in BBA-enriched genes like CXCL5, CXCL6, PTX3, SPP1, PLOD2, SERPINE1, MT2A, LOX, and COL6A3. These genes have a high correlation to arterial inflammation, lipid metabolization, severe atherosclerosis, and collagen degradation (|log2FC| > 0.75, FDR < 0.1, p < 0.05) ( Figure\u00a02B ). PTX3, SPP1, and LOX are important biomarkers for the mineralization and calcification of artery.

MGP and ADIRF are key regulators of physiological vascular cell lipid metabolism, while MYL9, MYH11, and ACTA2 are responsible for smooth muscle cell contraction and cell\u2013cell conjunction ( Figure\u00a02C ).

Mo/M\u03c6-2 enriched genes MT-RNR2, MT-RNR1, MALAT1, NEAT1, and MT-ATP6, which suggests an inactivated monocyte phenotype. Mo/M\u03c6-3 exhibited an increased expression of LYZ, S100A12, FCN1, AREG, and S100A8. These genes indicated a pro-inflammatory phenotype, while Mo/M\u03c6-4, -5, and -6 are prone to act as chemotaxis and exhibit antigen-presenting functions, which share a somewhat similar function with Mo/M\u03c6-1 ( Figure\u00a03A ).

We speculate that there might be a pre-existing pathological weakness on the parent artery of BBAs. In fact, similar speculations of the BBA etiological relevance to atherosclerosis have been made previously. However, evidence is lacking due to the inaccessibility and scarcity of samples. As little attention was given to this field, the etiology of BBA is still not known.

PTX3 is a recognized marker of vascular mineralization and atherosclerosis. A high expression of LOX, a receptor for oxidized LDL, also suggests that the development of BBAs shared a similar pathogenesis with intracranial arteriosclerosis.

The loss of VSMC contractile properties but gaining of fibroblast features enables them to repair vascular injuries, so they are a reckoned hallmark of aneurysmal and atherosclerotic lesions in the central and peripheral arterial systems.
