Although several studies have examined the impacts of prematurity and depression on early interactions, only a few studies have investigated the features of maternal verbal input. Furthermore, no study has investigated the relationship between the effect of severity of prematurity according to birth weight and maternal input. This study aimed to explore the effects of the severity of preterm birth and postnatal depression on maternal input during early interactions. The study included 64 mother\u2013infant dyads, classified into three groups: 17 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) preterm infants, 17 very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants, and 30 full-term (FT) infants. At 3 months postpartum (corrected age for preterm infants), the dyads participated in a 5-min free interaction session. Maternal input was analyzed using the CHILDES system in terms of lexical and syntactic complexity (i.e., word types, word tokens, mean length of the utterance) and functional features. Maternal postnatal depression (MPD) was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. The results showed that in high-risk conditions (i.e., ELBW preterm birth and maternal postnatal depression), maternal input was characterized by a lower frequency of affect-salient speech and a higher proportion of information-salient speech, specifically as directives and questions, suggesting that mothers in these conditions may experience more difficulty in conveying affective content to their infants. Moreover, the more frequent use of questions may reflect an interactive style characterized by a higher level of intrusiveness. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the impacts of prematurity severity and maternal depression on maternal verbal input, highlighting the importance of assessing both factors in clinical practice. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the impacts of prematurity and depression on early interactions may inform the development of tailored interventions aimed at promoting positive parent\u2013infant interactions and child development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2358, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

The risk of mortality or developmental delays is particularly evident when preterm infants are very small in terms of birth weight, as in cases of very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g) conditions. Several studies that focused on the neuropsychological trajectories of preterm infants have reported the presence of deficits or delays that could affect different developmental domains, such as the motor, cognitive, and linguistic domains. Constituting a specific risk factor for the infant\u2019s survival, health, and development, severe prematurity can represent a stressful and traumatic event for the parents, impairing the transition to parenthood, and leading to the exacerbation of negative feelings and perceptions about themselves as parents, along with recurrent and persistent worries about the baby. Indeed, the literature underlines an increased risk of developing postnatal depressive and anxious symptomatology in both mothers and fathers of high-risk preterm infants in the first postpartum period. Such symptomatology can negatively affect both parenting and infant development, as it can impact on the mother\u2019s ability to engage in interactive exchanges with her infant and reduce the quality and quantity of input directed towards the infant, potentially leading to more negative developmental outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3939, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Studies that analyzed the effect of the severity of prematurity on early dyadic interactions have highlighted a significant relationship between lower birth weight and the quality of mother\u2013infant interactions in the first postpartum period.

On the other hand, VLBW infants tend to have interactions with high levels of maternal sensitivity and infant communication. Furthermore, postnatal depression and anxiety in mothers have been associated with negative impacts on the quality of interactions, with depression being related to maternal remoteness and a negative affective state, and anxiety being linked to low sensitivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4742, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Infant-directed speech (IDS) represents a particular spontaneous register used by parents and caregivers to interact with infants and young children. This form of speech is different from adult-directed speech (ADS), as it is characterized by linguistic and acoustic features such as grammatical simplification, lexical repetition, and exaggerated prosody. These features have different important functions, such as arousing and sustaining the infant\u2019s attention, facilitating dyadic interactions, conveying affective and informative contents, and promoting linguistic development. Furthermore, IDS characteristics adjust dynamically over time, becoming more complex in order to support and shape the infant\u2019s linguistic, cognitive, and socio-affective development.

Interestingly, the literature highlights a variation in the functional characteristics of IDS across the first two years postpartum. In the early stages of development, adult speech addressed to young infants is described as more affective and characterized by a higher proportion of affect-salient utterances, such as diminutives, proper names, and onomatopoeias. As the infant grows up, IDS changes in its pragmatic functions, becoming more informative, contextualized, and descriptive.

At the same time, both formal and functional aspects of maternal speech addressed to the infant are influenced by the quality of mothers\u2019 affective states. Studies focused on depressed mothers have reported different IDS patterns and features compared to non-depressed mothers\u2019 speech (for a review, see). As regards the relations between IDS verbosity and maternal postnatal depression, several studies have reported a negative association between the amount of maternal IDS (in terms of total utterances, word tokens, and number of vocalizations) and the presence of maternal depressive symptomatology, highlighting the tendency of mothers with higher levels of depression to talk less with their babies. Conversely, a few studies did not find any statistically significant differences in maternal speech\u2019s verbosity between depressed and non-depressed mothers, suggesting the need for further studies. Concerning the lexical and syntactic complexity of maternal speech, measured by analyzing the number of different word types and the mean length of the utterance, Scheiber et al. did not find in their review any statistically significant differences in IDS produced by depressed mothers compared to non-depressed ones. However, the authors warned about these results because of possible bias related to the different procedures and methods with which both depressive symptomatology and IDS were measured. An interesting finding emerged in a study by Reissland et al., showing that depressed mothers, unlike non-depressed ones, did not show adaptation of their IDS with relation to the infant\u2019s age. In fact, when talking to their infant, they did not use shorter utterances when the infant was younger (i.e., 6 months old) compared to at 10 months of age, while non-depressed mothers showed this change. The use of shorter and syntactically simpler utterances is prototypical of IDS directed towards younger infants, because their cognitive and pre-linguistic abilities are still limited. However, the lack of this aspect in depressed mothers could suggest a lower ability of mothers with depression to adapt the complexity of their IDS according to their infants\u2019 age and abilities.

As highlighted by several perspectives (i.e., developmental psychology and psychopathology, infant research, affective neurosciences), during this developmental stage, maternal affective speech plays a crucial role in engaging the infant in positive interactions and promoting the development of a secure attachment bonding. From the first weeks after childbirth, the baby is able to process emotional information during dyadic interactions and prone to recognizing maternal affective expressions, which are frequently conveyed through maternal input. Research has indeed shown that younger infants are more responsive to affect-salient speech compared to information-salient speech, which becomes more relevant in later developmental stages, shaping the infant\u2019s cognitive, linguistic, and communicative development.

The overstimulating communicative style adopted by ELBW mothers while speaking to their babies could also reflect a certain degree of intrusiveness in interaction. This hypothesis is coherent with a previous study by Agostini et al., which reported more controlling and intrusive interactive behaviors in ELBW mothers compared to VLBW and FT ones. In fact, this interactive pattern would become evident when considering more severely premature infants, as a more intense maternal stimulation would emerge to enhance infant responsiveness.

This result is consistent with a previous study by Herrera et al. and may indicate a decreased ability of mothers with depressive symptoms to interact in a sensitive manner with their children, which means using more information-salient contents rather than affect-salient ones. Additionally, as higher information-salient input is more functional for sustaining the emerging linguistic and communicative skills in older children, the presence of more demanding maternal speech in depressed mothers may express a decreased ability to adapt their input to the their infant\u2019s developmental level, which would, in turn, suggest a lower degree of sensitivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31195, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is noteworthy that this study did not observe a significant interaction effect between severe prematurity and maternal depression, despite both being important factors that could influence maternal verbal input.

One of the main limitations of this study is the limited sample size, which restricts the generalizability of its results and reduces the power of data analyses; therefore, future research would benefit from an increase in the number of subjects. Another limitation of this study is represented by the exclusion of fathers from the research design. The follow-up program offered by the Laboratory of Developmental Psychodynamics (Department of Psychology, University of Bologna) involves the participation of both parents but, due to the low number of fathers who agreed to participate, they were not included in the present study.

Understanding the impact of premature birth on both parents\u2019 interactive behaviors can inform the development of targeted interventions and support programs for families in similar situations. A further limitation of our study is the collection of a limited range of sociodemographic variables; moreover, we could not collect data about the family history and obstetrics (such as corticotherapy, arterial umbilical pH, infant complications or diseases) of the participants in the study. For this reason, further studies should deepen our results by also including these variables and exploring any possible significant risk or protective effect in relation to the development of postpartum symptoms. An additional limitation of our study is represented by the use of a self-report questionnaire (EPDS) to assess the presence of maternal depressive symptoms. Future studies may benefit from complementing the use of self-report measures with diagnostic tools such as structured clinical interviews.
