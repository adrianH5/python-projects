Young children\u2019s understanding of drawing is better developed, with three year olds showing a grasp of the intentional nature of pictures.

Normally, quoted speech is presented without any determiner. For example, one might report She said it is raining, but not She said a it is raining. Draw is like most verbs in English, in that its argument is not a quoted form. Thus determiners are permitted and, in the case of singular count nouns, required. For example, we say Draw a kitten, but not normally Draw kitten. The verbs write and spell, by contrast, require quoted forms as their arguments. One says Write kitten and Spell kitten but not usually Write a kitten or Spell the kitten. This syntactic difference, if present in speech to young children, would indicate not only that writing and drawing are different but also that references to writing lack a determiner because they are quoting speech.

A full understanding of how writing works, of course, requires children to grasp exactly how writing goes about symbolizing spoken language. This further understanding may not happen until children receive formal instruction in school. Thus, although some aspects of literacy learning may require explicit instruction, children receive information about how writing works from informal interactions with their parents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 51737, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results also shed light on the ways in which young children understand writing. Their talk about writing changes across the preschool period, suggesting a respective set of changes in how they understand the glottographic nature of print. Previous studies have assessed children\u2019s understanding of writing by asking whether they to produce writings that are distinguishable from drawings and whether they explicitly recognize the difference between words and pictures. Although success at these tasks indicates knowledge about print, failure does not necessarily imply a lack of knowledge. The nature of our study allowed us to examine very young children who cannot easily participate in most production and recognition tasks. We found that children make some distinctions between writing and drawing from a young age but that the process of distinguishing the two systems is not complete even as children begin to do things such as produce their written names. This is shown, for example, by 4 and 5 year olds\u2019 statements such as draw my name.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52791, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results suggest that studies which focus on features of homes and families such as number of books in the home or time spent reading stories or teaching about letters have missed much of the richness of literacy-related activities that occur in homes. In particular, such studies have missed many of the conversations that mention writing. Our results show that such conversations occur sporadically across a host of contexts beginning when children are quite young and that they may provide children with useful information. In future research, it will be important to determine whether children take advantage of this information by examining early parent\u2013child conversations about writing in relation to children\u2019s later literacy skills. This was not possible in the current study, but our work sets the stage for future work by providing information about the types of parent speech that may be important.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 53709, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our use of the CHILDES data, while allowing us insight into literacy-related discussions that occur in homes, had certain other limitations. Although we had a large sample, there were certain age ranges for which only small amounts of data were available. The longitudinal analyses that we included mitigated the effects of this limitation to some extent, but not totally. Further, our analyses were confined to English. It would be valuable to examine data from other languages and cultures to provide a more complete understanding of language-specific and language-universal cues. It is also important to examine parent\u2013child conversations about writing as a function of social class and parent education. The CHILDES sample is skewed toward middle- and upper-middle-class families, as mentioned earlier, but differences as a function of social class and education would be anticipated on the basis of previous findings (e.g.,). In the present study, we did not have enough data to allow for separate analyses of different subgroups. In other ways, however, the variability among the corpora\u2014in date collected, context, and family background\u2014 were advantageous for our exploratory purposes, allowing us tosurvey the extent to which young children and their parents discuss written language across a broad range of conditions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 55043, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although much work remains to be done, our results show that children are exposed to information about certain aspects of writing in conversations with their parents even before formal instruction in reading and writing begins and even before they produce anything resembling conventional writing.

The present findings thus offer insight into the environmental input that may help children develop an understanding of the nature of written language.
