The goal of the present study was to explore syndrome-specific pragmatic profiles of adults with FXS and WS based on the assessment of the observance of Gricean maxims of conversation. The participants were 12 Spanish-speaking adults (6 FXS/6 WS), without a diagnosis of ASD, whose extensive naturalistic conversations (71,859 words) were transcribed and coded with the CHILDES/TALKBANK tools and the PREP-CORP pragmatic protocol. Violations of the maxims of conversation were analyzed, and indexes of cooperation and conversational response were obtained. Both groups showed reduced verbal production and repetitive dysfluencies; prominent features in the FXS profile were higher proportion of non-contingent language, perseverations of topic and form, and impulsive conversational responses; in the WS profile, salient characteristics were higher proportion of tangential utterances, reformulations, and conversational responses reflecting overly literal interpretation. Pragmatic profiles of violation of conversational maxims reflect specific communication skills impaired in adults with FXS and WS and raise the need for assessment and intervention methods that specifically address their social communication abilities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1529, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

These findings are consistent with the results of Roberts et al. indicating that non-contingent and perseverative speech were the most salient features in boys with FXS compared with peers with Down syndrome. Despite the higher levels of perseveration and tangential language in the FXS group, these types of violation of the conversational maxims still accounted for more than 12% in the pragmatic profile of cooperation of the WS group.

Thus, qualitative differences in the profiles were also observed, with a more marked tendency to perseveration in the FXS group and to tangential language in the WS group. Perseveration of topic and tangential language might then be considered not unique to FXS but also a symptom of pragmatic impairment in adults with WS, so that in this respect there would essentially exist a difference in degree between the syndromes. Social anxiety could account for these results, given that it has been described in both syndromes.

It has been suggested that utterance perseveration might be more distinctive in the FXS profile than topic perseveration. The presence of such stereotyped and idiosyncratic language in adults with FXS and without autism would confirm that phrase and topic perseveration is part of the FXS phenotype and, therefore, should not be considered among the discriminating criteria of ASD comorbidity in FXS. On the other hand, the individuals in the WS group presented a significantly higher index of reformulation, which to our knowledge is an aspect not described previously in the literature. Such tendency to reformulate or rephrase during discourse construction in the case of individuals with WS may partly explain why their relative strengths in grammar are not matched by pragmatic skills in conversational use.

Furthermore, a narrow conception of SPCD would also pose therapeutic dilemmas since, in FXS and WS, cross-cutting needs for assessment and treatment of social communication difficulties would persist. Pragmatic language skills contribute to the capacity for adult independent functioning in FXS; therefore, language intervention may be essential for this purpose.
