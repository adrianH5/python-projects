Semantic networks built in these ways from adult normative data have structural properties that are believed to support efficient processing and word retrieval. One property of large scale semantic networks that has been linked to their growth processes is a power-law structure in the distribution of links across nodes: most nodes in the network have few links to other nodes but a few nodes are hubs, having many links to other nodes.
