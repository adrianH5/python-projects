Most individuals in the cohort had a PCR or antigen test around the time of initial infection. Similar to existing findings, the large majority of reinfections occurred during the Omicron epoch.

The large number of reinfections during Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 makes it challenging to draw conclusions about comparing reinfections between variants because there may be other factors, such as adherence to masking or social distance policies, that impacted the likelihood of exposure and subsequent reinfections.

One possible interpretation is that experiencing hospitalization during reinfection may be related to experiencing hospitalization during the first infection, but the hospitalization may be less severe. A second possible explanation is that later variants tend to cause less severe infection.
