In addition, inclusion of data from a wide array of institutions increases sample size enabling researchers to study less common conditions or treatments, and can enhance generalizability of results. Electronic health records (EHR) are generated at the time of healthcare delivery as a component of clinical care. Structured data in EHR typically include detailed information on clinical encounters including any procedures, diagnoses, ordered and administered medications, demographic data, vitals, and lab orders and results. Because the United States does not have a universal healthcare system, EHR data are maintained by individual health systems, each with different standards and protocols for data collection and storage, leading to a high degree of variability in the availability and quality of data across systems. Even when the same EHR platform is used by two health systems, differences in implementation are common.

While information exchanges do exist, such as Epic CareEverywhere or Health Information Exchange, there are no guarantees on availability of such records for research purposes. If hospitalized patients typically receive primary health care services from a health system other than that of the admitting hospital, then any prior treatments, medications, immunizations, diagnoses, etc. may not be reflected in the EHR from the system where the COVID hospitalization occurred.

The general protocol for performing this analysis would be as follows: first, an initial analysis would be performed including only those patients whose EHR-continuity can be established. Then, the influence of EHR-discontinuity would be assessed by sequentially introducing groups with less prior history; in the N3C, the data include two additional groups, 1-23\u2009months of prior history, and no prior history.

These detailed clinical data measured at index admission can be used as more proximal measures to account for differences in severity of illness across patients, and may be more relevant than many chronic comorbidities that are more difficult to measure. When using the a multi-site EHR database, researchers will need to consider the specific research question at hand, what baseline confounders will be important to measure, and how much history is needed to reliably measure confounders of interest.

Depending on the time of day, a small difference in when a death was recorded and when a visit was ended can result in them occurring on different days.

It is part of a broader trend in which sources of RWD are consolidated into larger repositories for research purposes. This enables large-scale validation of findings across multiple health systems, the ability to achieve sufficient statistical power when investigating treatments and conditions with low prevalence, and improve equitability and representation of underserved hospitals and patient demographics in treatment effect studies. In addition, large data sets provide an opportunity for the deployment of machine learning methods while mitigating the risk of overfitting. As a centralized repository, N3C aggregates and harmonizes data in a single location. While this comes with its own challenges, it allows the data to be queried at the row level and enables detailed centralized investigations into data quality such as those presented here. This is in contrast to federated data models which allow data to be queried in aggregate, but rely on data curation at the local level. Nevertheless, operationalizing definitions for key clinical events can be complicated by limitations in site reporting and a loss of granularity through the use of a common data model to harmonize data across partners. The advantages of harmonization, however, outweighs the loss of granularity when addressing many research questions. The efficiency of centralization is also a significant advantage and was witnessed through the course of this study. For example, a number of sites using the ACT CDM initially did not have the ability to report vitals, but subsequently these data were made available due to continuous feedback during the review process.

Data missingness, for example, remains a significant analytical challenge. It may be reasonable to suspect that many of the lab measurements investigated in this study are informatively missing, in that they are clinically indicated (and thus ordered) only in the most severe patient cases. Yet, this may be confounded by individual data-contributing health systems\u2019 respective capacities to obtain these measures at a given point in time (e.g., clinicians faced with an overwhelming caseload during pandemic \u2018peaks\u2019 may have inferred a level of clinical severity in some patients without ordering/recording such measures once seeing it repeatedly in other clinically similar cases). This suspected mixture of missing at random (MAR) and missing not-at-random (MNAR) mechanisms, likely varying over time within each data partner health system, presents a challenge to data analysts who \u23e4 in trying to delineate between instances of informatively vs. inadvertently missing values \u23e4 cannot directly access subject-matter experts (such as clinical care providers experienced in each health system during each time interval under study) to form the reasonably defensible assumptions required, assumptions not verifiable from EHR data alone. With many severity-of-illness indicators, it is common to create derived factors and missing data indicators. For example, body temperature may be used to create a three-level factor: \u201cNormal temperature (<= 38 deg C)\u201d, \u201cFever (> 38 deg C)\u201d, and \u201cMissing.\u201d However, this approach has been shown to exhibit severe bias even with MAR data. The danger of this approach becomes even more evident when glancing at data missingness as a function of data partner and time shown previously in Fig. 2. A more principled variation on this approach is forming distinct (collections of) additional variable(s) indicating the missing value status for each variable in any given analysis; conditioning on these indicators in downstream analyses would make explicit the assumptions inherent to how those with missing values may be plausibly assumed to differ from those without missing values for the variables prone to missingness (and would inform analysts how to elicit plausible assumptions from domain experts, by considering these \u2018full\u2019 data).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 57537, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Excluding sites which are major contributors to data missingness does not eliminate all missing data, and there are outstanding issues that still need to be addressed. Here, considering the different possible mechanisms responsible for missingness is necessary. One contribution to overall missingness involves mechanisms reasonably assumed to be MCAR (an effectively random sample of individuals from included sites still lack values expected to have been recorded), while another likely contribution is disease severity. This mechanism is closely related to what is termed in the statistical literature as outcome-dependent observation processes. Labs are usually ordered in sets, with complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) being the most common, followed by complete metabolic panel (CMP). For COVID-19 positive patients, some providers may add CRP, d-dimer, and ferritin to CBC and BMP panels. Importantly, all of these orders vary depending on patient condition, provider practice, and standards of care - all of which may vary throughout the course of the pandemic; thus more tenable assumptions can be adopted (at least approximately, to mitigate bias) after considering how analyses incorporate care settings (from healthcare-system down to clinic/provide levels) as well as calendar time as proxy measures for such systematic differences.

In that case, a number of techniques including multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting exist to handle said missingness under specific assumptions, though special attention needs to be paid to both the model specification and algorithm.

However, a dedicated investigation into the effectiveness of dexamethasone may involve more subsetting of data based on availability of dosage and route of administration. Alternative explanations for observed drug exposure patterns should also receive consideration.

Therefore, estimating EHR continuity, as we have outlined above, is a crucial part of mitigating the resulting bias. It cannot be assumed that the lack of a given baseline comorbidity or therapy is evidence of its absence, particularly for chronic conditions and medications, unless EHR continuity can be established. This is also true for COVID-19 vaccination, which is an important exposure for COVID-19-related studies. There is no explicit indicator of non-vaccination, and the widespread availability of vaccines can further contribute to data fragmentation. It does appear however that some institutions may synchronize vaccination records with their state\u2019s vaccine registry, which provides one strategy for assessing the completeness of an institution\u2019s vaccine records. Given the significant potential for information bias due to EHR-discontinuity, some have proposed using predictive modeling to identify patients with high EHR-continuity. Furthermore, carefully designed methodological frameworks are needed to handle selection bias (the sickest patients often have the most complete records) which can arise when enforcing data completeness for the EHR data. There are ongoing efforts within N3C to link to CMS claims which will address many of these concerns for at least a specific patient population.

ICU admissions, for example, cannot be resolved from the visit-level information available, notwithstanding the possibility that some sites repurposed non-ICUs to serve as ICUs during surges in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, despite the popularity of composite outcomes, such as death or discharge to hospice, we find that most data partners do not provide discharge disposition. Perhaps most importantly with regards to outcomes is the lack of availability of mortality data outside the EHR, for the time being, which underestimates overall mortality and restricts investigations to in-hospital mortality alone. Although the use of survival methods may not be the most appropriate choice for patients who are hospitalized with critical illness, they are still nonetheless quite widely used. For survival analysis, being limited to in-hospital mortality alone has important implications. Patients who are discharged from the hospital are typically discharged due to recovery, or to a different care facility due to disease severity. In either case, the risk of death among discharged patients is not the same as those patients who remain hospitalized. Censoring patients at discharge introduces a differential risk of death between censored and non-censored observations, violating the non-informative censoring assumption necessary for common survival models such as Cox proportional hazards. This violation can be addressed by censoring all patients after a fixed time period, known as the \u201cbest-case\u201d or \u201cbest-outcome\u201d approach, which assumes discharged patients have survived until the end of the observation period. Alternatively, one can treat discharge as a competing outcome and rely on the subdistribution hazard function or other methods for competing-risk analysis. The most direct remedy would be to link patient records through PPRL to ancillary sources of mortality data to capture deaths post-discharge.
