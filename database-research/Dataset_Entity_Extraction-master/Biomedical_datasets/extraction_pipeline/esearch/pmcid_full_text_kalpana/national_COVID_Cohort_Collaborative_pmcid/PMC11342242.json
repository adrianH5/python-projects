In the United States (US), there have been >100 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, with >1 million deaths reported between January 2020 and March 2023. Some survivors present with persistent neurological, respiratory, or cardiovascular symptoms after the acute phase of the infection, regardless of the initial disease severity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes these long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection as post-COVID conditions (PCCs), postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), or long COVID. Per the CDC, long COVID consists of a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems occurring \u22654 weeks after first being infected with SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis showed that long COVID is associated with poor quality of life. A cross-sectional study conducted in the US in 2021\u20132022 found that 13.9% of US adults with a prior positive COVID-19 test reported continued symptoms >2 months after acute illness, representing 1.7% of US adults. Based on data collected by the US Census Bureau and CDC in June 2022, 19% of adults who have had COVID-19 have persistent symptoms of long COVID, and 7.5% of adults in the US have symptoms that have lasted >3 months after first infection. An estimated 2 million people in the United Kingdom self-reported long COVID symptoms as of 5 March 2023. Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe's corona surveys (2020\u20132021) indicated a prevalence of 71.6% for long COVID with an average of 3 symptoms among the respondents aged \u226550 years in 27 countries across Europe.

Age above 40\u201350 years, female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority group, smoking, obesity, higher number of preexisting medical conditions, and socioeconomic deprivation have shown an association with greater risk of long COVID, while completion of primary vaccination series prior to infection shows protective effects. Previous studies based on regional COVID-19 patients suggest that preexisting lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, are risk factors for long COVID. A cross-sectional study that focused on adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute COVID-19 during the first 2 waves in the United Kingdom found that preexisting lung disease was associated with a greater number of long COVID symptoms. A cohort study in Italy demonstrated a significant association between obstructive lung disease and long COVID among 739 nonhospitalized healthcare workers confirmed COVID-19 positive. These studies were based on select study populations and conducted within different time frames. Many of them relied on a limited sample size and focused on a narrower timeframe of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lack of a shared and specific definition of long COVID, and limited confounding factors included in the analyses, also suggests the need for further evaluation of the association between preexisting chronic lung diseases (CLDs) and the occurrence of long COVID. More recently, a retrospective case-control study based on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) established a machine learning\u2013based PASC diagnosis with CLD as one of the predictors in the model. Large, randomized controlled trials, such as the Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae and Immunity (RECON-19) and Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) studies, have focused on cohort characterization and symptom clustering.

The most common symptoms are shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and tightness in the chest. For this study, we identified a cohort with preexisting CLD before the first acute COVID-19 diagnosis in the N3C Data Enclave (the CLD group). In addition to the primary exposure, we included variables potentially associated with the outcome. Demographic characteristics were captured using age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Social history factors included tobacco use and substance abuse. Vaccination status was categorized into 3 groups: (1) incomplete vaccination (including patients who were unvaccinated or failed to complete the primary vaccination series, the reference); (2) completed primary series (including patients who completed the primary vaccination series but not boosted); and (3) boosted (including patients who received 1 or more boosters). We also accounted for the effects of medication history before the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and medications for acute COVID-19 treatment (see details in Supplementary Table 1), and all of the variables on medication use were dichotomous.

A cohort study in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia showed that preexisting lung disease was a predictor for dyspnea and was associated with higher risk for chronic fatigue between 6 weeks and 6 months after hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19. Our results came to the same conclusion. After adjusting for the confounders, we demonstrated a significant association between preexisting CLD and higher odds of long COVID. We also found that patients were more likely to develop long COVID if they were female, at older ages, or living in an urban area. The effects of sex and age are consistent with previous studies. The association with living in an urban area could be partially explained by the fact that more air pollution in urban area contributes to lung disease. It is also potentially confounded by the fact that people living in urban areas may have more access to healthcare resources and may be more likely to be diagnosed. In addition, some risk factors, such as positive antibody after infection, reinfection, rheumatologic disease, depression, obesity, and malnutrition, may be related to highly activated immune cells and elevated expression of cytokines. The higher odds of long COVID could be explained by the immune and inflammatory status under these conditions. Our findings on COVID-19 waves differ from a Spanish retrospective study (N = 325) and a Brazilian case-control study (N = 7051), which identified infection during Delta and Omicron waves as protective factors against long COVID.

Existing evidence suggests that immunosuppression could help tamper the cytokine storm or other aspects of the inflammatory response and thus HIV, characterized by immunodeficiency, is shown to have protective effects against long COVID. In terms of tobacco use, studies have shown that smokers are less likely to seek healthcare help for respiratory symptoms and long COVID might be underdiagnosed in this population. Similarly, help-seeking behavior is less frequent in people with substance abuse. This may account for the counterintuitive results that tobacco use and substance abuse were associated with lower odds for long COVID diagnosis. Our results concur with a systematic review and meta-analysis showing that vaccines have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of long COVID. However, the effects of vaccines were not statistically significant among those with CLD.

Use of the ICD-10 code was a unified way to define the response variable and made it easier to compare the results across studies using the same criteria for the response variable. Another notable advantage of our approach was the comprehensive integration of covariates associated with socioeconomic conditions, geographical influences, and preexisting or concurrent medication use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A survey in Italy showed that 28.9% of COVID-19 patients reported persistent symptoms >4 weeks from the onset of infection. The Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey showed that the prevalence of long COVID decreased to 6% among US adults in June 2023. Unawareness of long COVID and few show-ups at clinic for persistent symptoms in the early stage of the pandemic account for the underestimated long COVID cases in our study. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis supports the robustness of the results to the underreporting issue. In addition, the independent and dependent variables are constructed based on the concept sets (ICD-10 codes, etc) that are dependent on clinician and data coder inputs; data from different sites are potentially heterogeneous. There was no effort as part of this project in verifying these data at the site level as the N3C provides a limited data set with no potential reidentification of patients and no potential for chart review.
