Scientists warn that recurrences are likely after the current initial pandemic, particularly if SARS-CoV-2 immunity wanes over time. To curb this trajectory, in addition to public health measures to contain the virus as much as possible, it is crucial to gather large amounts of data in a comprehensive and unbiased fashion.

What treatments, risk factors, and social determinants of health (SDoH) impact disease course and outcome? How do we develop, adapt, and deploy CDS to keep up with a dynamic pandemic?

These networks are a vital resource for responding to the COVID-19 crisis, revealing key patterns in the disease. However, their distributed nature would greatly complicate certain types of analyses that require a centralized approach to enable timely analyses. Study questions and data queries that can be prespecified, such as testing for associations between one or a group of comorbidities and laboratory results, are often answerable using federated networks. In contrast, centralized resources can greatly simplify implementation of iterative processes such as training deep learning algorithms and carrying out clustering for phenotype development. A centralized resource also enables rapid integration with knowledge graphs and other translational knowledge and data sources to aid discovery, prioritization, and weighting of results. Federated machine learning algorithms will likely ultimately play important roles in allowing model training on distributed datasets. While these methods show great promise, we have chosen not to pursue this approach at this time to avoid adding complexity to an already ambitious project. Creating a massive corpus of harmonized EHR data for analytics would support rapid collaboration and discovery, and also build on the substantial resources (eg, CDM-specific data quality tools) developed within the federated consortia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5582, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The recent retractions in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine have underscored the need for fully provenanced and reproducible EHR analyses as major policy decisions that can hinge on EHR results.

Detailed temporal analyses of the progression of respiratory and other organ system dysfunctions are possible. Prevalence and predictors of complications such as cardiomyopathy, thrombosis, acute kidney injury, hypoxemia, stroke, and delirium can be evaluated. For populations with rare complications, such as the emergence of Kawasaki disease-like inflammatory symptoms, a centralized dataset provides the statistical power to characterize emerging adverse effects.
