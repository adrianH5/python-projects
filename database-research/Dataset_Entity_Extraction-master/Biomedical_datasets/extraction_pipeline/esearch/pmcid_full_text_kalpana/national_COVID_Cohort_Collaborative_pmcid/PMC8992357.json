The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) was created to share and harmonize individual-level electronic health record (EHR) data into a single dataset. The N3C has received, ingested, harmonized, and characterized data from across the United States. To balance data access and privacy, N3C created 2 levels of datasets: (1) the limited dataset (LDS) which has 16 HIPAA Privacy Rule direct identifiers stripped out except dates and zip codes, and (2) synthetic data which are computationally derived from the LDS to mimic the LDS data statistical distributions, covariance, and higher order interactions.

Thus, synthetic data may be the only privacy-preserving (pending privacy evaluations) N3C data that can be used to analyze some of the most critically important data related to pandemic management and preparedness while also providing citizens more transparency into the underlying data. However, previous research has reported deficits in how well-synthetic data mimic original data including limitations in their: ability to capture longitudinal relationships, model multiple data types, and perform well on small sample sizes Due to the combination of potential widespread synthetic data dissemination, heightened research interest in COVID-19, and the rise of \u201ccitizen science,\u201d the user base and applications of pandemic-related synthetic data will likely be heterogeneous and broad.

Additionally, the synthetic error relative to the original data value is likely small enough for most uses of synthetic data.

Since it is impossible to have less than zero count, the synthetic data cannot add privacy-producing noise in the negative direction for zip code monthly counts equal to 0. Consequently, the synthetic data systematically underestimate the monthly count of key indicators in zip codes with the most tests, cases, and deaths, and overestimate them in zip codes with the least.

In our study, we found the bulk of patients in the N3C data live in a small minority of zip codes (Figure\u00a02), likely those most adjacent to institutions contributing data. These zip codes are therefore more likely to be urban and less likely to have their zip code censored (Table\u00a03). As a consequence, rural zip codes, which are already underrepresented in the original data, become even less available to directly analyze. Additionally, patients with censored zip codes were older, potentially due to older patients traveling from sparsely tested regions to receive care offered at distant academic medical centers which participate in N3C.
