Additional analyses including two other phase II trials with a similar design also evaluating bendamustine debulking, followed by obinutuzumab with either ibrutinib or venetoclax (NCT02345863 and NCT02401503), are under way. First results suggest that the overall rate of adverse events and especially of cytopenias and infections are not increased, while infusion-related reactions seem to be less common in patients with prior debulking. The administration of single-agent ibrutinib over 2 to 3 months might serve as an alternative approach for debulking, as it effectively reduces the lymphadenopathy through a redistribution of the CLL cells to the blood.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22939, "infons": {"file": null, "id": "table003b", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "Adverse events during induction with ofatumumab and ibrutinib reported in \u22655% of patients: data are number of patients (%).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23065, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The inclusion of an all-comer population led to a quite heterogeneous group of patients. This might be seen as a limitation of the study but it can also be argued that it helps to transfer the results to routine clinical practice. The lack of CR confirmed by CT/MRI scan and bone marrow may also be criticized, but as the majority of patients continue treatment in a maintenance phase, it is planned that the missing examinations will be performed later. These assessments were not mandatory per study protocol at a defined time point in order to avoid unnecessary and repetitive CT scans or bone marrow biopsies. Instead it was recommended to perform these examinations as soon as the best clinical response was achieved, which is consistent with the updated IWCLL guidelines. Figure 2A suggests that the depth of response increases over time and consequently also the rates of CR and MRD \"negativity\". However, so far, only a few patients have achieved a deep, MRD-negative remission and have been able to stop maintenance treatment. The efficacy results in the current analysis are not superior to those achieved with ibrutinib monotherapy. The findings of six other clinical trials evaluating a combination of ibrutinib with an anti-CD20 antibody in patients with CLL have been published. Three evaluated the combination of ibrutinib with rituximab (including 2 randomized studies with single-agent ibrutinib as a comparator arm), two with obinutuzumab and one with ofatumumab. Cumulative evidence from these trials indicates that the addition of an antibody leads to faster and deeper remissions and one study showed that the achievement of a CR is associated with longer progression-free survival. However, the two randomized trials with ibrutinib with or without rituximab did not show (or have not yet shown) a difference in survival times. When comparing the results of this trial with those of the CLL2-BIG trial, which evaluated the same treatment regimen but with obinutuzumab instead of ofatumumab, the responses appear to be deeper, as the MRD \"negativity\" rate at the end of induction treatment was 48% compared to 14% in CLL2-BIO. The addition of an antibody to ibrutinib cannot be recommended in routine practice, but individual patients in whom a faster response or clearance of the lymphocytes from the peripheral blood is needed might benefit from a combination treatment. However, in such situations obinutuzumab should be favored over rituximab and ofatumumab based on the current data and because ofatumumab is available only in the USA but not in Europe anymore.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25652, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Further follow-up is necessary to determine whether bendamustine followed by ofatumumab and ibrutinib can produce deep, MRD negative remissions in a relevant proportion of patients and whether treatment can be stopped in this situation. For the regimen with bendamustine debulking followed by ibrutinib with obinutuzumab instead of ofatumumab it was already shown that patients, including those with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, remain in remission for a clinically meaningful time after termination of treatment. Termination of ibrutinib monotherapy would constitute a novel paradigm, as it overcomes the need for indefinite treatment, which is so far needed to maintain responses with the B-cell receptor signaling pathway inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib. Shortened treatment durations might reduce problems of patient compliance as well as treatment costs. It could also avoid resistance due to clonal evolution arising from a therapeutic pressure selecting small subclones with resistance mechanisms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []},
