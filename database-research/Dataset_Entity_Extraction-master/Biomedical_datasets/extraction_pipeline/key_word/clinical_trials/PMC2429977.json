Ticlopidine and later clopidogrel became a routine part of every percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Later, the CREDO and PCI-CURE trials showed that the patients pre-treated with clopidogrel have a lower risk of periprocedural ischaemic events. Clopidogrel became widely used for patients undergoing PCI. However, the loading dose given before PCI varies among different clinical trials and different hospitals. The approved loading dose is 300 mg. However, 600 mg loading dose was shown to be superior in a small randomized trial and is used with increasing frequency with supporting data from trials in acute coronary syndromes. These two loading doses are compared in the ongoing large randomized multicentre trial CURRENT/OASIS-7. Recommended time for the loading dose is >6 h before PCI. However, nearly all PCIs are currently performed as \u2018ad hoc\u2019 procedures [i.e. immediately following the diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG)], and thus the time between the decision to intervene and PCI procedure is just a few minutes. Due to this fact, some hospitals administer the loading dose of clopidogrel in advance to all patients undergoing CAG, others administer it during the procedure (i.e. after CAG) only to those undergoing PCI. It has not been established yet which of these strategies is better. Most Czech PCI centres have been using clopidogrel before PCI \u2018selectively\u2019 (i.e. in the cath-lab between CAG and PCI or even after PCI) in their routine practice for many years. When the new ESC guidelines for PCI were published in 2005, five study centres decided to compare their routinely used \u2018old selective\u2019 strategy with the ESC guidelines recommended \u2018new non-selective\u2019 strategy and the PRAGUE-8 trial design was born.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3879, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The hypothetical advantage of the \u2018non-selective\u2019 approach (clopidogrel >6 h before each elective CAG) is the full drug effect during ad hoc PCI resulting in a lower rate of ischaemic periprocedural complications.
