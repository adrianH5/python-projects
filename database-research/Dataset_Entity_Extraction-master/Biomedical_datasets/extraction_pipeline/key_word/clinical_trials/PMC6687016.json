We elected a lower minimum duration because this support can only be provided in an ICU setting at many centres, and in a population with a low baseline reintubation rate the intervention could potentially lead to longer ICU lengths of stay than necessary. The design of the PROPER trial specifies the provision of postextubation respiratory support from extubation until at least 5:00\u00a0hours the following day, at which point the patient\u2019s readiness to wean from postextubation respiratory support is assessed. This strategy involves a minimum of 5\u2009hours of respiratory support, and our preliminary data suggest a median of 17\u2009hours of support.

Previous studies have evaluated reintubation over a broad range of time intervals, from 48\u2009hours to 7 days and longer. Longer time intervals capture more events but increase the risk that the reintubation is unrelated to the original illness and respiratory function in the immediate postextubation period. Intubation within 96\u2009hours of extubation was chosen as the primary outcome based on a large observational study assessing time to reintubation in 96\u2009367 adults who received ventilation in an ICU in the USA. That study proposed 96\u2009hours as the optimal time point at which to assess reintubation. While justifiable, selection of a binary endpoint occurring within a defined time window might miss evidence for benefit, and so we have prespecified a survival analysis that considers time to reintubation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41463, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our design, we have made choices to bias towards the null. This means there are several threats to observing a difference between study groups. Foremost, the anticipated median duration of postextubation respiratory support of 17\u2009hours is shorter than the 24\u201348\u2009hours delivered in some prior trials. Some patients may be intolerant of postextubation respiratory support, which may further limit the average exposure to the study interventions. It is also possible that the use of postextubation respiratory support in the usual care group may be higher during the study period than prior to the trial due to increasing provider familiarity with postextubation respiratory support, contamination from the unblinded intervention being delivered in the same study location, or both. The provision of postextubation support provided in the usual care group of this single centre trial may not match the experience at other centres so we will provide data on the use of NIV and HFNC in the usual care arm of PROPER to assist in the interpretation of the results. Another potential possibility is that use of one therapy will be similar between the intervention and usual care groups (eg, use of NIV) with substantial separation between groups in the other therapy (eg, use of HFNC). This would require a more nuanced interpretation of the study findings. Treating clinicians are aware of study group assignment and so clinicians may alter the timing of extubation or management of postextubation respiratory failure based on group assignment. To assess for such bias, we will present characteristics of the two study groups at extubation, including duration of mechanical ventilation prior to extubation, and information about use of rescue respiratory support in the two groups. We will also perform analyses that adjust for these factors or conduct prespecified sensitivity analyses. Finally, group assignment at the level of the cluster with multiple cluster-level crossovers introduces the possibility for intracluster correlation, intraperiod correlation, and intracluster intraperiod correlation, which may confound the relationship between group assignment and outcome. In the PROPER trial, the two clusters are anticipated to be extremely similar, as they are two halves of a single ICU. The periods are relatively short and each cluster alternates between group assignment relatively frequently. Among patients in the study ICU in the year prior to the trial who would have met criteria for enrolment, we measured these correlations and found the effect of intracluster correlation, intraperiod correlation and intracluster intraperiod correlation to be negligible (see online\u00a0supplementary methods).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44178, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44189, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We describe, before the conclusion of enrolment or data unblinding, our trial design and our approach to analysing the data from a large, pragmatic, cluster\u00a0cross-over trial comparing the rate of reintubation between patients receiving protocolized post-extubation respiratory support on reintubation and those patients receiving usual care.
