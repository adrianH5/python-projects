Prior to March 2020, 19.7% of respondents were food insecure. Our regression models estimate that food insecurity rose by 9.1 percentage points in our first round of surveys (June\u2013September 2020; p\u2009<\u20090.05; t\u2009=\u20092.17), increasing to 17.2 percentage points in the second round of surveys (July\u2013November 2021; p\u2009<\u20090.05; t\u2009=\u20092.32). Qualitative interviews reveal that employment loss and deteriorating support systems led to reduced meals and purchasing of cheaper foods.

Our own research documented how people living with HIV (PLWH) in Uganda were impacted directly by COVID-19, stating that it negatively impacted their ART adherence in several diverse ways. For example, our mixed-methods study showed 14% of the sample said that COVID-19 had negatively impacted their ART adherence. We also found lockdowns and other mitigation measures taken to prevent infection spread discouraged clinic attendance: clinic visits plummeted by more than 50% after a national lockdown was initiated.

For example, reduced financial well-being could limit PLWH\u2019s ability to purchase food, which may in turn, limit their ability to take their ART medication consistently and correctly. Substantial evidence suggests that food insecurity can influence HIV outcomes and is associated with decreased ART adherence, reduced baseline CD4 cell count, incomplete virologic suppression, and decreased survival.

Individual fixed-effects are important because they adjust for the change in sample composition between the pre-and post-COVID survey waves (some participants had more pre- and/or post-COVID surveys than others). Calendar month is highly collinear with the post-COVID surveys, so we prefer specifications without calendar month included. Thus, our preferred specification includes individual fixed-effects without calendar month fixed-effects.

In our preferred regression specifications, we find that food insecurity among PLWH in our sample rose by approximately 40% just within a few months of the COVID-19-related lockdowns in Uganda, and almost a year later, it had increased by more than 80% compared to before the pandemic. Food insecurity can be particularly harmful for PLWH because ART medication typically should be taken with food to minimize side effects. Although we do not find evidence of reduced ART adherence following the start of the pandemic in our study, there is evidence that food insecurity is closely linked to adherence. A recent study from the same setting found that lack of food is one of the most important barriers to ART adherence. Food insecurity could also impact adherence through other mechanisms such as depression, which increased following the start of the pandemic. Thus, although we do not find evidence of reduced adherence in the short run, the increase in food insecurity documented in our study may lead to harmful effects on ART adherence as the pandemic continues.
