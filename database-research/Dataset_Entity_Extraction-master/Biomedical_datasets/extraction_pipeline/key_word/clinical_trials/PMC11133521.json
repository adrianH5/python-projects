The therapies available for AML can affect lymphocyte function, limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy while hindering leukemia-specific immune reactions. Recently, the treatment based on Venetoclax (VEN), a specific B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor, in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or low-dose cytarabine, has emerged as a promising clinical strategy in AML. To better understand the immunological effect of VEN treatment, we characterized the phenotype and immune checkpoint (IC) receptors\u2019 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from AML patients after the first and second cycle of HMA in combination with VEN. HMA and VEN treatment significantly increased the percentage of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells and TIM-3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and reduced cytokine-secreting non-suppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs). Of note, a comparison between AML patients treated with HMA only and HMA in combination with VEN revealed the specific contribution of VEN in modulating the immune cell repertoire. Indeed, the reduction of cytokine-secreting non-suppressive Tregs, the increased TIM-3 expression on CD8+ T cells, and the reduced co-expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are all VEN-specific. Collectively, our study shed light on immune modulation induced by VEN treatment, providing the rationale for a novel therapeutic combination of VEN and IC inhibitors in AML patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1828, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1841, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive heterogeneous disease.

Furthermore, AML cells can enhance T cell dysfunction through the expression of ligands activating immune checkpoint (IC) receptors expressed on T cells, modulating their functionality. These findings have provided the rationale for IC inhibitor (ICI)-based therapies in AML patients. However, despite the solid preclinical background, the early clinical results from trials addressing the impact of ICIs in AML have been globally disappointing. These data indicate the need for a more in-depth understanding of the complex cellular network operating within the AML immune microenvironment. Furthermore, considering that many studies have already shown that chemotherapy can be detrimental to the activity and survival of immune cells, a better characterization of the immunological effects of novel drugs is of utmost importance for fully exploiting immunotherapy strategies in AML.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3573, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The targeting of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) pathway has emerged as an efficacious and well-tolerated clinical strategy in AML.

It is well-known that VEN causes leukemic cell apoptosis through several characterized mechanisms. However, VEN resistance can occur and biomarkers able to predict response to treatment are still under investigation. Furthermore, few studies analyzed the bystander effect of VEN on immune cells. In particular, it has been shown that VEN enhances T cell-mediated activity against AML cells both in vitro and in vivo through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in parallel, azacitidine increases AML cell susceptibility to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity through viral mimicry. Furthermore, in AML patients, HMA and VEN treatment modulates the phenotype of NK and T cells, IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CD8+ T cells and Treg proliferation.

Interestingly, various T cell subsets depend on BCL-2 for their survival to varying degrees and, thus, may be influenced by the treatment with VEN. In particular, na\u00efve and memory T cells require BCL-2 for survival and/or homeostasis. In our study, after HMA plus VEN treatment, we did not find a modulation of either the total percentage of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells nor the percentage of CD4/CD8 immune T cell subsets, except for an increase of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells. This finding contrasts with previous works showing that BCL-2 inhibition in different settings led to a reduction of total and na\u00efve T cells and to an increase in the proportion of memory T cells. In particular, in AML patients treated with HMA and VEN a depletion of total T, B and NK cells and an increase of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell frequencies with an effector memory phenotype at the expense of na\u00efve T cells have been observed. However, despite a decrease in the total number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, their differentiation status did not change after 1 year of VEN-based therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The discrepancy in these findings could be due to different reasons:1) the different timing of blood collection during the therapy; 2) the analysis of percentages compared to the absolute numbers, and 3) the different cell surface markers used to identify the T cell immune subsets. Furthermore, it must be considered that our particular and previously unexplored setting, i.e. the paired analysis conducted on patients treated with HMA plus VEN or HMA only, may have allowed us to distinguish a VEN-dependent effect from an HMA-dependent effect. In our hands, VEN did not alter the percentage of CD8+ na\u00efve T cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27317, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Next, we found that HMA plus VEN treatment did not affect total Tregs and their subsets, according with a previous study. These results are corroborated by the demonstration that Tregs are relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by BCL-2 inhibition compared to other T cells. Indeed, BCL-2 is not required for Treg survival, as opposed to MCL-1, another member of the BCL-2 pathway, the loss of which leads to fatal autoimmunity in a mouse model. Interestingly, by analysing Tregs\u2019 subset after HMA plus VEN treatment, we found a decrease in the CD25+/CD45RA-/FOXP3+ T cells, which represent a cytokine-secreting and non-suppressive population with Th17 cell potential. Of note, we did not observe such reduction in patients treated with HMA only, suggesting a putative-specific role of VEN.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 28113, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the effect of VEN treatment on this cell population. The plasticity of CD4+ T cell subsets is well-known, and in particular, the plasticity between Th17 and Tregs has been described. The Th17 and Treg differentiation networks play a critical role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, Th17 cells are considered a double-edged sword in solid tumors, promoting at the same time tumor progression, angiogenesis, and anti-tumor response, and immune cells\u2019 recruiting. In line with this, Th17 cells can promote both pro- and anti-tumor immunity in hematological malignancies. An increase in Th17 cells was associated both with better and worse clinical outcomes in AML patients.

However, when we paired patients to dissect the contribution of VEN, this finding was not confirmed. On the contrary, we found a VEN-specific increased expression of TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells after the first cycle. As previously mentioned, TIM-3 expression has been associated with exhaustion and dysfunction of T cells, and with immune evasion in AML. Interestingly, AML cells can enhance the expression of inhibitory receptors, including TIM-3, thus determining CD4+ T cell exhaustion in vitro, and TIM-3 expression on immune cells has been correlated to both a better and a poor prognosis in AML patients. Besides its expression on immune cells, TIM-3 has been found in AML leukemia stem cells but not in their normal counterparts, and increased levels of Galectin- 9, a TIM-3 ligand, were found in AML patients\u2019 serum. However, despite its implications in cell survival and disease progression, the role of TIM-3 on AML cells is still unknown and the blockade of TIM-3 as a single agent did not show a substantial clinical benefit. However, our finding showing the increased TIM-3 expression on CD8+ T cells after VEN treatment could support on-going clinical trials based on the use of TIM-3 inhibitor (NCT03066648, NCT04150029, NCT04623216) in combination with VEN.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30485, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Of note, we found a significant VEN-dependent decrease of PD-1+TIM-3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after the first treatment cycle.

A higher proportion of PD-1+TIM-3+\u2009\u2009CD3+\u2009 T cells in the bone marrow and of PD-1+\u2009\u2009TIM-3+\u2009\u2009CD4+\u2009 T cells in the PB of non-complete remission versus CR patients after first-cycle chemotherapy were observed.
