Tumors exploit these mechanisms to escape immune surveillance and promote immune evasion. The interaction of programmed cell death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) with its receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1), which is found in lymphocytes and monocytes, is one of the major pathways exploited by cancer cells for immune evasion. PD-L1 is constitutively expressed in a wide variety of tumors and has been associated with clinical response. Binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 on activated T cells inhibits anti-tumor immunity by counteracting T cell-activating signals. Therapeutic antibodies blocking the PD-(L)1 signal restore anti-tumor immunity and lead to durable tumor regression.

This suggests that resistance to cancer immunotherapy can be mediated by additional immune checkpoints. There are intense ongoing efforts to identify new immune checkpoints and to develop approaches that can expand the benefits of immunotherapy to a larger patient pool. Among potential targets, LAG-3 has emerged as a possible candidate based on encouraging results in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. LAG-3 is a transmembrane protein primarily found on activated T cells and a subset of natural killer (NK) cells, where it mainly functions as a receptor that delivers inhibitory signals. The LAG-3 protein consists of four extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1\u2013D4) with high homology to CD4 and indeed binds to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) with a higher affinity than CD4. Studies in LAG-3 knock-out mice demonstrated an inhibitory role of LAG-3 in regulating CD8+\u00a0and CD4+\u00a0T cell proliferation. Currently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block the interaction of LAG-3 with its canonical ligand, MHC-II, are being evaluated for their antitumor activity in clinical trials (NCT02460224, NCT01968109, and NCT02720068), and limited responses have been reported as monotherapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4258, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Co-expression of LAG-3 and PD-1 on intra-tumoral T cells has been observed in several mouse tumor models, and the combination of anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-LAG-3 antibodies synergistically inhibits tumor growth in preclinical tumor models.

These studies generated a rationale for blocking both LAG-3 and PD-(L)1 molecules in a clinical setting. In a phase III trial in first-line melanoma, relatlimab combined with nivolumab resulted in a significantly longer median PFS compared with nivomumab alone (10.1 versus 4.6\u00a0months).

Given the difficulties to calculate the absolute cell number in blood, we measured the proportions of different immune cell subsets within the CD45 population. After IBI323 treatment, the proportions of CD8+\u00a0T and CD4+\u00a0T cells within the CD45 population were significantly higher than control group (Figure 5b). Importantly, IBI323 treatment enhanced the number of effector cytokine-producing, tumor-specific CD8+\u00a0and CD4+\u00a0T cells in the tumor (Figure 5c\u2013f) and blood (Figure 5g\u2013j), as detected by flow cytometry after incubation with MC38 tumor cells ex vivo.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35228, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35239, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments are the backbone for many clinical trials in various types of cancer and have been combined with other treatment strategies. However, owing to treatment resistance, alternative immune checkpoint blockers are desperately needed. LAG-3, a promising immune checkpoint, is mainly found on activated immune cells and is involved in the process of T cell exhaustion. Its co-expression with PD-1 has led to extensive research on the blockade of LAG-3 and PD-(L)1 in preclinical and clinical settings.

Along with tumor cells, PD-L1 expression is also upregulated in T cells in the tumor microenvironment in response to antigen presentation. PD-L1 acts as both ligand and receptor on T cells, which exert tumor-promoting tolerance in the adjacent innate and adaptive immune compartments. The binding properties of IBI323 to T cells, which express both PD-L1 and Lag3, suggest the cis-action of IBI323 on PD-L1 and LAG-3 double-positive T cells in vitro. The avidity of the multivalent IBI323, obtained by targeting PD-L1 and LAG-3 on one T cell, may lead to prolonged inhibition of immunosuppressive pathways. In addition, PD-L1 is also expressed on different types of tumor cells and professional APCs. Lag-3 was mainly found on activated T and NK cells. We showed that IBI323 mediates the crosslinking between PD-L1+\u00a0cells and LAG-3+\u00a0cells in a simplified in vitro system comprising two types of target-expressing cells. IBI323-mediated crosslinking of PD-L1 on APCs and LAG-3 on T cells may stabilize immunological synapses and thereby facilitate T cell activation.

As human PD-L1 and LAG-3 can bind to murine PD-1 and murine MHC-II molecules, respectively, we evaluated the in vivo activity of IBI323 in PD-L1/LAG-3 double knock-in mouse model bearing human PD-L1 knock-in MC38 colon adenocarcinoma. IBI323 significantly inhibited MC38 tumor growth through both CD8+\u00a0and CD4+\u00a0T cells and led to increased number of cytokine producing cancer-specific T cells in the tumors and blood. In addition, we further evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of IBI323 in NOG mice reconstituted with human immune cells that can capture the distinct features of the corresponding human immune system and tumor microenvironment.

However, we indeed observed that the absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in tumor increased significantly compared with IgG control group one week post IBI323 treatment. There might be several reasons for this difference: 1) We used PD-L1/LAG-3 double knock-in mice to characterize the mechanism of action of IBI323 directly. 2) The affinity of IBI323 to human antigens is higher than the affinity of FS118 surrogate antibody to mouse antigens. Therefore, IBI323 is possible to induce stronger anti-tumor immune response. Of note, we optimized the affinities of the PD-L1- and LAG-3-binding moieties, by applying two PD-L1 sdAs and LAG-3 mAb affinity maturation, respectively, to guarantee that IBI323 binds with high affinity to PD-L1+\u00a0tumor cells while maintaining the blocking function of anti-LAG-3 mAb. The unequal affinities to PD-L1 and LAG-3 might result in a certain degree of IBI323 accumulation within PD-L1+\u00a0tumor.
