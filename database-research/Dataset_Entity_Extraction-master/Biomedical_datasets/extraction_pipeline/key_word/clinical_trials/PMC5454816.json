Moreover, mitophagy, a specific type of autophagy that selectively degrades excessive or damaged mitochondria, is shown to contribute to cancer progression and recurrence in several types of tumors. Nanomedicine has been shown to tackle the CSCs problem by overcoming drug resistance. In this work, we developed a nanomedicine, 188Re-liposome, which was demonstrated to target autophagy and mitophagy in the tumor microenvironment. Of note, the inhibition of autophagy and mitophagy could lead to significant tumor inhibition in two xenograft animal models. Lastly, we presented two cases of recurrent ovarian cancer, both in drug resistance status that received a level I dose from a phase I clinical trial.

This normal physiological mechanism, which responds to defective or damaged organelles, activates fusion with lysosomes to digest mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes. A number of investigations suggest that autophagy induction can promote resistance to cell death within tumor cells and play a critical role in resistance to chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Besides traditional cancer hallmarks, now the regulation of autophagy is recognized as a new hallmark of cancer cells. Autophagy is able to facilitate survival of cancer cells through conquering metabolic stress and chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity. For example, pancreatic cancer cells showed elevated autophagy in cases when treated with chemotherapy.

During mitophagy, dysfunctional mitochondria are engulfed by a double-layered membrane (phagophore) and form so-called autophagosome followed by degradation. Recently, the concept of an autophagic tumor-stroma model of cancer cell metabolism that is relevant to mitophagy has been advocated. According to this model, tumor-released ROS induce oxidative stress in adjacent tumor-associated fibroblasts. These permissive fibroblasts may respond at two levels: first, by producing more ROS, which in turn promote DNA damage and aneuploidy in the malignant cells (i.e., genomic instability), and secondly, these tumor-associated fibroblasts enter into a \u2018reverse Warburg effect\u2019, whereby they can undergo autophagy/mitophagy and aerobic glycolysis that eventually leads the tumor microenvironment to be more prone to tumor progression and drug resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14428, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "From a clinical standpoint, some trials have showed the efficacy of autophagy inhibitors.

At the writing of this manuscript, two cases are still alive, and the performance scores are 0/1, implying a low toxicity of 188Re-liposome. Currently, there are several ongoing early clinical trials exploiting autophagy inhibition to fight cancer. The aim of the presentation of the two clinical cases is not to present the report of phase I trial of 188Re-liposome. Instead, we just present the potential of 188Re-liposome to reverse drug resistance status. The results of these trials may change the treatment outlook for ovarian cancer. In the future, randomized multi-institutional studies are justified to confirm the valid potential of this novel strategy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25787, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title"}, "text": "Author Contributions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25808, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Chia-Ming Chang, Chih-Hsien Chang and Chi-Mu Chuang conceived and designed the experiments; Keng-Li Lan performed the experiments; Chia-Ming Chang, Wen-Sheng Huang, and Yi-Jang Lee analyzed the data; Chih-Hsien Chang and Te-Wei Lee contributed reagents, materials, and analysis tools; Chia-Ming Chang and Chi-Mu Chuang wrote the paper; Keng-Li Lan and Chih-Hsien Chang revised the manuscript contents; and Chia-Ming Chang and Chi-Mu Chuang approved the final version.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26276, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "title"}, "text": "Conflicts of Interest", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26298, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The authors declared no conflict of interest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26344, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26355, "infons": {"fpage": "7", "lpage": "17", "name_0": "surname:Schorge;given-names:J.O.", "name_1": "surname:Modesitt;given-names:S.C.", "name_2": "surname:Coleman;given-names:R.L.", "name_3": "surname:Cohn;given-names:D.E.", "name_4": "surname:Kauff;given-names:N.D.", "name_5": "surname:Duska;given-names:L.R.", "name_6": "surname:Herzog;given-names:T.J.", "pub-id_doi": "10.1016/j.ygyno.2010.06.003", "pub-id_pmid": "20692025", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Gynecol.
