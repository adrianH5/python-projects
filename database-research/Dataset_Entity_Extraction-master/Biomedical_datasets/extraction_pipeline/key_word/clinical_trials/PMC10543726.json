CD8+ T cells remained relatively stable, as has been shown previously. The percentage of Tregs, a key cell type in immune tolerance, was increased with stable gene expression and methylation of FOXP3 following ATG monotherapy. However, in the combination therapy, G-CSF appeared to impact Treg-associated genes in a negative way, through increased methylation at the FOXP3 TSDR locus and reduced FOXP3, IL2RA, and GATA3 transcript expression, which may have dampened its clinical effectiveness. Likewise, the IL-6 concentration was elevated in ATG/G-CSF responders compared with nonresponders. This difference was not seen in the ATG arm alone. IL-6 has been described as an effector molecule of G-CSF treatment and also plays a role in differentiation of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to effector phenotypes, specifically promoting Th17 cells at the expense of peripheral Tregs. Overall, similar Th1- and proinflammatory-type cytokines were stimulated in both treatment arms, although the cytokine surge was prolonged following combination treatment (through 12 weeks after the start of therapy).

A CD8+ T cell exhaustion phenotype has been associated not only with slower progression to complete loss of insulin secretion following diagnosis, but also with response to teplizumab (anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody) in new-onset T1D and at-risk individuals, as well as alefacept (lymphocyte function\u2013associated antigen 3\u2013IgG fusion protein) in new-onset individuals. Overall, a common shift toward T cell exhaustion following treatment with agents such as teplizumab, alefacept, or ATG now display some congruence in terms of a positive responder signature in the setting of autoimmunity, in opposition to the unfavorable state of T cell exhaustion in the context of chronic infection or cancer. Additionally, we can postulate that the strong activation signal resulting from low-dose ATG may work in the immune system to either delete autoreactive precursors (subject to ongoing investigations), exhaust T cells, and/or simultaneously preserve Tregs. Autoreactive T cell receptors are often low to moderate affinity, or they would be deleted by thymic negative selection.
