AD is the most common inflammatory skin disease worldwide with currently up to 25% of children and 1\u20133% of adults being affected (Weidinger et al,). Besides genetic predispositions, environmental and immunological factors contribute to AD manifestation and pathogenesis rendering it a multifactorial disease. Defects in the epidermal barrier of human skin favor sensitization and strong inflammatory responses to external stimuli, ultimately triggering a systemic response (Bieber,).

This receptor complex is expressed by a wide range of immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and T cells but also epithelial cells and neurons (Zhong et al,). TSLP binding activates the TSLPR complex, which in turn activates protein tyrosine kinases and transcription factors including STAT3, STAT5, STAT6, and GATA3 which promote the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 (Arima et al,; Rochman et al,). Moreover, TSLP activates DCs that subsequently prime human CD4+ T cells into Th2 cytokine-producing cells in local lymph nodes (Soumelis et al,; Watanabe et al,; Ebner et al,). TSLP signaling in CD4+ T cells is also required for memory formation after Th2 sensitization (Wang et al,) and the activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells, which further drive the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases (Kim et al,).

Formation of site I is essential for the second step, in which the TSLP:TSLPR complex recruits IL-7R\u03b1, thus, forming the signaling complex (Verstraete et al,; Verstraete et al,). Hereby, TSLP establishes a T-shaped ternary complex through two extensive interaction interfaces, namely site I (TSLP:TSLPR) and site II (TSLP:IL-7R\u03b1). TSLP bridges the two receptors and site III (TSLPR:IL-7Ra) is formed involving the interaction between the membrane proximal residues of the two receptors (Verstraete et al,; Verstraete et al,).

Notably, some of the most active NCI-DTP compounds did not possess a terminal aromatic ring system and instead possessed a carbamoylsulfanyl moiety (i.e., NSC13363 and NSC13350). Sixteen diverse compounds were synthesized and again screened for their efficacy to block TSLP-induced IL-4 and IL-13 release in Hut78 cells. From these sixteen compounds, BP79 most effectively blocked IL-13 (80% inhibition at 20\u2009\u00b5M) and IL-4 (60% inhibition at 20\u2009\u00b5M) release in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a03C,D). Combining features of C7 and C13 (i.e., BP86) led to a decrease in potency compared to both C7 and C13, supporting that these compounds are not likely to act as binders of both TSLP and TSLPR. Replacement of the sulfur atom with other heteroatoms appears to be reasonably tolerated, yet the most profound discovery was that the terminal dihydroimidazole or aromatic moiety was not required for potent inhibitory activity, as observed with BP79 (Fig.\u00a03G; Appendix Tables\u00a0S2\u2013S7).

TSLP activates JAK1 and JAK2 and subsequently phosphorylates downstream signaling proteins such as STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6. To identify the secondary messengers that stimulate Th2 cytokine secretion in primary human CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, TSLP-activated T cells were treated with inhibitors of JAK1/2 (ruxolinitib (Sada et al,) and AZD1870 (Hedvat et al,)), STAT3/5 (SH-4-54) (Haftchenary et al,), STAT5 (573108) (M\u00fcller et al,), and STAT6 (AS1517499) (Chiba et al,) inhibitors showing that targeting the JAK-STAT pathway impairs IL-4 and IL-13 secretion (Appendix Fig.\u00a0S3). In particular, the inhibition of JAK1/2, and STAT6 effectively downregulated Th2 cytokine secretion. In addition, the STAT3/5 dual inhibitor suppressed IL-4 and IL-13 secretion. However, STAT5 inhibition only modestly decreased Th2 cytokine secretion and primarily at rather high concentrations (100\u2009\u00b5M). In keratinocytes, TSLP activates STAT3, thus, downregulating the skin barrier protein filaggrin while upregulating TSLP expression (Kim et al,; Dai et al,). Interestingly, BP79 treatment blocked STAT3 and STAT6 phosphorylation in keratinocytes and CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells (Fig.\u00a04G,H), respectively, suggesting that its inhibitory effect on IL-4 and IL-13 release indeed results from an inhibition of TSLP signaling.

Subsequently, we compared treated versus untreated skin and lung samples. For atopic-like and normal skin models, we observed a large number of differentially expressed genes, indicating a strong treatment effect. At FDR\u2009<\u20090.01, there were 1080 genes with at least twofold difference in treated versus untreated diseased skin models (Appendix Fig.\u00a0S7) substantiating the presence of the disease phenotype, and the anti-inflammatory effect of BP79. On gene level, the topical application of BP79 onto diseased skin significantly changed protein synthesis and cell metabolism (Appendix Table\u00a0S8; Fig.\u00a08D). Further, we found that the transcription profiles of treated diseased skin were more similar to healthy skin than untreated diseased skin. For example, at FDR\u2009<\u20090.01 and absolute log2 FC\u2009>\u20092, there were 1080 DEGs between treated and untreated diseased skin, 809 DEGs between treated diseased skin and healthy skin, and as much as 3331 DEGs between untreated diseased skin and healthy skin.

Other classic tools to verify target engagement such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements did not produce conclusive results. This may be due to the following reasons: (1) TSLPR and IL-7R are transmembrane receptors. While recombinant proteins are commercially available, their quality, purity, and functionality are highly variable. It is possible that they are not folded correctly, thus preventing to assess the binding of small molecules. Such recombinant proteins are typically stabilized by His- or Fc-tags, which may also impact the protein structure, thus not resembling the native state.

While murine and human TSLP operate in a similar manner (Verstraete et al,; Verstraete et al,), they only share 43% and 35% homology for TSLPR, respectively, with no cross-reactivity between the species (Savino and Izraeli,). Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no animal model available to accurately mimic human TSLP-mediated Th2 inflammation in atopic diseases. Our TSLP inhibitors have been specifically designed to block human TSLPR, rendering currently available mouse models unsuitable.
