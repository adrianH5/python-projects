At present, there are effective approaches that can reduce the incidence of diabetic kidney disease and postpone its progression such as controlling blood glucose levels and blood pressure as well as blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Many researches of traditional Chinese medicine have also been carried out in the treatment of DN and have made some achievement in recent years, such as berberine, Qidan Dihuang grain (QDDHG), and Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS). The mechanism of action may be multifaceted, such as regulating glucose metabolism, correcting lipid metabolism disorder, inhibiting the activation of polyol pathway, antioxidative stress, improving the structure and function of podocytes, inhibiting inflammatory response, and intervening cell signal transduction.

In recent decades, many studies on DN have been carried out, and some results have been achieved. However, no better treatment drugs or measures have been produced so far. In recent years, Chinese traditional medicine in the treatment of DKD has also carried out a lot of researches and has made achievements. Wang et al.'s study has shown that cordyceps sinensis can protect renal tubules and promote renal tubules repair in animal models of drug-induced acute renal injury, thus improving renal function. Researches showed that cordyceps cicadae could alleviate glomerulosclerosis and improve the chronic renal failure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13335, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study systematically studied the potential mechanism of cordyceps cicadae for the treatment of DN by the method of network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis and analyzed and constructed the \u201cactive ingredient-target-disease\u201d network diagram of cordyceps cicadae for the treatment of DN. 36 main active ingredients of cordyceps cicadae and 85 common targets of DN, including myriocin, guanosine, and adenosine, were screened out through the database search and screening. Besides, key targets such as AKT1, MAPK8, MAPK1, TP53, IL6, and TNF were screened out. Molecular docking studies showed the binding modes of myriocin with ATK1 and MAPK8. AKT is a serine threonine kinase, a central regulator of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Podocyte injury is a predictive indicator of DN. It has been reported that can inhibit podocyte autophagy and aggravate its apoptosis through the AKT pathway. IL-6 is a proinflammatory factor, and one of the important factors in the occurrence of DN is inflammation. DN patients showed a higher level of IL-6, which positively correlated with the extent of proteinuria. IL-6 seemed to be a good biomarker of chronic kidney injury; the signal transduction inflammatory response it participated in was critical to the progression of DN. Study suggests that these IL-6 responses were mediated through a gp130-STAT3-dependent mechanism. TP53 is also called TRIAP1. Under high-glucose conditions, TRIAP1 is a small conserved protein containing 76 amino acids. It is induced by TP53 under low-level genotoxic stress and helps reduce cell death. It has been reported that TRIAP1 interacts with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to regulate the apoptosis pathway. Studies have shown that TRIAP1 is a direct target of miR-770-5p. The expression of miR-770-5p in podocytes is upregulated under high-glucose conditions, and the downregulation of miR-770-5p by targeting TRIAP1 can eliminate podocytes induced by high glucose and inhibit cell apoptosis, which further proves that TP53 has a potential role in the occurrence and development of DN. In a diabetic environment, the increasing production of glycation end products activates NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and other signaling pathways, which in turn mediates the activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways and promotes the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix. MAPK8 is related to lipid metabolism, and lipid metabolism disorder is an important risk factor for the occurrence of DN. GO enrichment analysis results showed that the key targets were mainly enriched in BH3 domain binding, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential biological processes. It was reported in the literature that the BH3 domain was involved in the process of cell apoptosis and autophagy. Mitochondria also play a very important role in the process of cell apoptosis. The results of pathway enrichment indicated that R-HSA-450341, 157.14-3-3 cell cycle, and PDGF signal pathways may be related to the treatment of DN by cordyceps sinensis. Among the active compounds of cordyceps cicadae, the candidate compounds that may be related to these targets include myriocin, \u03b2-sitosterol, guanosine, arachidonic acid, inosine, berberine, cinnamaldehyde, linoleyl acetate, uralene, linoleic acid, and deoxyandrographolide. Myriocin (ISP-1, thermozymocidin), an atypical amino acid, was isolated from the culture broth, mycelia, and sporoderm-broken spore powders of cordyceps cicadae. The molecular docking studies showed that myriocin bound to AKT1 with four key hydrogen bonds as well as to MAKP8 through two hydrogen bonds. The results revealed that myriocin, one active compound of cordyceps cicadae, may act on AKT1 and MAPK8. However, the main active compounds of cordyceps cicadae such as myriocin that may act on the DN targets require further experimental verifications and explorations. The interaction of active compounds from cordyceps cicadae needs further research. In order to verify the effectiveness of network pharmacological screening of active compounds and targets, we will further use molecular biology methods to investigate the effects and molecular mechanism of candidate compounds on targets and their effects on DN.
