Then, the memory impairment is aggravated and the logical thinking and comprehensive analysis abilities decrease. As the condition worsens, the cognitive impairment becomes more serious and widespread, making the person incapable of simple daily life tasks such as dressing and eating; at this time, the individual may be diagnosed with AD dementia. Later in the disease, patients suffer from impaired mobility, hallucinations, and seizures. The average duration from symptom onset to death is 8.5 years. At present, the underlying mechanism of AD is unclear and may be associated with pathological processes such as the deposition of extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. AD pathology is confirmed in the entorhinal and temporal cortexes. A previous study identified that the expression of genes highly correlates with AD tau pathology and is most significantly increased in the entorhinal cortex, followed by the temporal cortex; tau pathology usually begins in the medial temporal lobe (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) in the allogeneic cortex. It is generally believed that the entorhinal cortex is the earliest brain structure with pathological changes in AD, while layer II of the entorhinal cortex is one of the most severely affected structures in AD.

FPR3, also known as FPRL2, is a member of the FPR family localized within the cytoplasm. Human FPRs belong to the G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors, which are expressed in blood innate immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, playing an important role in infection and inflammation. Interestingly, it has been reported that another subtype of the FPR family, FPRL1, can be specifically activated by \u0391\u03b242, suggesting that FPRL1 may be involved in the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. GABRB2 encodes the \u03b22 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor, which regulates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and plays an important role in the nervous system. Some researchers believe that GABRB2 is related to schizophrenia, but this view is widely controversial. GABRG2 encodes the GABA-A receptor subunit \u03b32. Mutation of this gene contributes to the pathogenesis of both febrile seizures and childhood absence epilepsy. GABRA1 encodes the GABA-A receptor subunit \u03b11.

The genes selected through our research are closely related to the GABA-A receptor. \u03b22, \u03b32, and \u03b11 subunits, which are encoded by GABAB2, GABAG2, and GABRA1, respectively, are the most abundant receptor forms (\u03b11\u03b22\u03b32) in the brain. Patients with AD exhibit nonamnestic manifestations, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, which may be attributed to GABAergic dysfunction. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling governs the function of the nervous system. The destruction of GABAergic neurons and GABA receptors disrupts the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, which is a crucial mechanism involved in epilepsy and seizures. The seizure rate of patients with AD significantly increases compared with that of normal people, and the stability of the neural network in the AD brain is decreased, suggesting that the E/I imbalance is strongly related to the pathogenesis of AD. Researchers have studied the pathogenic factors A\u03b2, BACAE1, and APOE\u03b54 and hyperactive glial cells and concluded that all result in GABAergic dysfunction and E/I imbalance in AD mouse models. More importantly, correcting the E/I imbalance improves the cognitive dysfunction in mice with AD. Besides, ageing is the strongest risk factor for AD and is related to GABAergic damage, which may lead to cognitive decline in rodents and primates. The prevalence of AD in females is higher than that in males; further, there are obvious sex-based differences in GABAergic signaling and progression of AD.

Currently approved clinical drugs for AD are modulators of the cholinergic and glutamatergic targets, but their effects are limited, suggesting that other drugs are needed to restore the E/I imbalance. Presently, the GABAergic dysfunction is thought to be a significant cause of E/I imbalance and pathogenesis in the AD brain, making it a potential therapeutic target. The GABA-A receptor has already been identified as a prolific target for some therapeutic drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anesthetics, and ethanol. It has been found that a low dose of benzodiazepine clonazepam (0.05\u2009mg/kg) is beneficial to AD, and a daily peritoneal injection of the GABA-A receptor potentiator pentobarbital sodium rescues the learning and memory impairment in ApoE4-Ki mice, while the GABA-A receptor antagonist reverses this rescue. To restore the E/I balance, five agonists (meprobamate, topiramate, glutethimide, sevoflurane, and ergoloid mesylates) targeting the GABA-A receptor are useful in AD, while the rest of the antagonists may be related to the aggravation of the cognitive impairment.
