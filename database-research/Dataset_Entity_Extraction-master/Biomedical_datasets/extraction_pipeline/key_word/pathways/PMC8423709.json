However, to date, alterations in iron metabolism in the epileptogenic brain have not been addressed in detail. Iron-related neuropathology and antioxidant metabolic processes were investigated in resected brain tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), post-mortem brain tissue from patients who died after status epilepticus (SE) as well as brain tissue from the electrically induced SE rat model of TLE. Magnetic susceptibility of the presumed seizure-onset zone from three patients with focal epilepsy was compared during and after seizure activity. Finally, the cellular effects of iron overload were studied in vitro using an acute mouse hippocampal slice preparation and cultured human fetal astrocytes. While iron-accumulating neurons had a pyknotic morphology, astrocytes appeared to acquire iron-sequestrating capacity as indicated by prominent ferritin expression and iron retention in the hippocampus of patients with SE or TLE. Interictal to postictal comparison revealed increased magnetic susceptibility in the seizure-onset zone of epilepsy patients. Post-SE rats had consistently higher hippocampal iron levels during the acute and chronic phase (when spontaneous recurrent seizures are evident). In vitro, in acute slices that were exposed to iron, neurons readily took up iron, which was exacerbated by induced epileptiform activity. Human astrocyte cultures challenged with iron and ROS increased their antioxidant and iron-binding capacity, but simultaneously developed a pro-inflammatory phenotype upon chronic exposure. These data suggest that seizure-mediated, chronic neuronal iron uptake might play a role in neuronal dysfunction/loss in TLE-HS. On the other hand, astrocytes sequester iron, specifically in chronic epilepsy. This function might transform astrocytes into a highly resistant, pro-inflammatory phenotype potentially contributing to pro-epileptogenic inflammatory processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2268, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Information", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2294, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00401-021-02348-6.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2386, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2399, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that is characterized by \u201can enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition\u201d. Epileptogenesis describes the pathogenic process by which physiological and structural changes in the brain are induced, leading to increased seizure susceptibility and enhanced likelihood of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) to occur. A major pathogenic mechanism of epileptogenesis in epilepsies of various etiology is oxidative stress (OS).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2973, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "OS is defined as an imbalance between the antioxidant capacity of a cell or tissue and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a shift towards the latter leading to cell damage or even cell death. During acute seizure activity, excessive ROS are generated due to i.e. mitochondrial dysfunction and/or increased activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Targeting OS by providing ROS scavenging antioxidants or by boosting endogenous antioxidant systems, specifically the activity of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf-2), was shown to have a beneficial disease-modifying effect in models of acquired epilepsy, delaying onset and progression of seizures. These effects were likely facilitated by proteins involved in the production and recycling of the primary intracellular antioxidant glutathione.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3857, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this context, recent evidence from congenital epilepsies due to focal cortical dysplasia and tuberous sclerosis complex indicates that OS and iron metabolism are tightly linked and could act synergistically to exacerbate cell dysfunction and damage in epilepsy. Accordingly, high concentrations of unbound Fe2+ iron could act as catalyst in the Haber\u2013Weiss and Fenton reactions to enhance the potency of hydrogen peroxide from cellular processes to more reactive ROS like the hydroxyl radical or hydroxide ion, thereby facilitating cell dysfunction or death. Besides congenital epilepsies, intracerebral hemorrhages resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and sequential post-traumatic epilepsy are characterized by brain iron deposition and intracortical iron injections evoke seizures and epilepsy in experimental models. Additionally, independent of large-scale hemorrhages, dysfunction of the BBB is a hallmark of a variety of epileptogenic pathologies in which iron concentrations could increase locally by non-specific leakage of iron-rich blood components into the brain parenchyma and subsequent iron release. In line with this, previous microarray studies of brain tissue from low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors and a rat model of acquired epilepsy point towards a critical role of iron metabolism in epilepsy. However, up to now, alterations in iron metabolism and its consequences have not been assessed in detail in brain tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5358, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study aims to investigate (1) if iron accumulation and iron metabolism are altered after status epilepticus (SE) and in TLE per se in conjunction with OS and antioxidant capacity, (2) which cell types are involved in iron regulation and (3) whether iron has ictogenic effects and could be involved in epileptogenesis. To this end, we evaluated OS and iron metabolism in post-mortem brain tissue of patients who died after SE and in surgically resected brain tissue from patients suffering from intractable TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) to elucidate the effects of acute seizure activity and chronic epilepsy in iron metabolism, respectively. These findings were further validated by assessing the transcriptome of a cohort of TLE-HS hippocampal tissue. Furthermore, by employing quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of three patients with focal epilepsies, spatial and temporal changes in iron in the seizure-onset zone were assessed. Consequently, iron overload and affected cell types were studied during different stages of epileptogenesis in the electrical post-SE model of TLE.

In total, 6125 downregulated and 5937 upregulated genes were identified, containing a multitude of genes involved in functions related to antioxidant capacity and iron metabolism (Fig.\u00a03a). Two sets of genes relating to different functional modules were sub-selected for analysis: 1. a combined list of genes involved in detoxification of ROS and glutathione conjugation and 2. genes involved in iron uptake and transport. Investigation of a subset of genes involved in glutathione metabolism revealed upregulation of cysteine import (xCT [SLC7A11], SLC3A2, CD44), glutathione synthesis (GCLC, GSS) as well as recycling (GSR) and glutathione-dependent peroxidation (GPx1). A subset of genes involved in iron metabolism revealed lower expression of iron uptake (TFR2), iron binding (FTH1, FTL) and iron export suppression (HAMP), while genes involved in endosomal iron reduction and export (STEAP3, DMT-1 [SLC11A2]) as well as cellular iron export (FPN-1 [SLC40A1], HEPH) were overexpressed compared to autopsy control tissue.

To investigate the relationships between cytopathology and the transcriptional changes of glutathione metabolism, a correlation analysis was conducted of xCT [SLC7A11], GCLC and GPX1 with either the astrocyte marker GFAP or neuronal marker RBFOX3 (NeuN).

Expression of FTH-1 and FTL was higher upon FAC and GO/FAC stimulation, while FPN-1 was only elevated compared to control in cells exposed to GO/FAC (Fig.\u00a07c).

Time-dependent changes in RNA expression of glutathione and iron metabolism genes in response to FAC, GO or H2O2 in astrocytes were investigated as well (Online resource 5a-f). These experiments revealed prominent changes in iron metabolism genes predominantly in response to OS, not iron overload (Online resource 5b, d, f). Positive Perl\u2019s iron stain and quantification of iron in fetal astrocytes exposed to GO/FAC or hemin/H2O2, indicated an uptake of iron (Fig.\u00a07e, f, h, i). Moreover, without compromising cell viability (Online resource 5i, j), HMGB-1 in the supernatant was higher in chronic GO/FAC stimulation, while it was lower in hemin/H2O2-treated astrocytes (Fig.\u00a07g, j). Since astrocytes are important mediators of neuroinflammation in TLE-HS, expression of pro-inflammatory mediators upon FAC and GO/FAC or hemin and hemin/H2O2 were assessed as well.

Indeed, iron accumulation in CA1 neurons of SE and TLE-HS tissue could be found specifically in neuronal nuclei and nucleoli. Iron in neuronal nuclei was previously demonstrated upon ultrastructural analysis in the rat brain, supposedly playing important physiological roles e.g. in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA. Notably, very strong iron accumulation in neuronal nuclei was detected in TLE-HS and SE in pyknotic neurons. Since pyknosis is a feature of degenerating neurons, this finding indicates that nuclear iron accumulation accompanies neuronal cell death in TLE-HS. Furthermore, ferritin was not expressed in neurons, indicating a low iron storage capacity. In agreement with this finding, elevated nuclear iron accumulation was previously found in degenerating neurons in the context of hereditary iron storage disorders and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Although total neuronal iron load in SE and TLE-HS tissue was low, the DAB-enhanced Perl\u2019s method detects Fe3+. Hence, the visualized iron likely represents non-reactive, protein-bound Fe3+ iron. Unbound, soluble Fe2+, which represents the more Fenton-reactive pool, could also accumulate and more readily react with ROS in neurons.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 87458, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Higher 4-HNE reactivity was detected in neurons in SE and TLE-HS tissue. Additionally, high 4-HNE adducts could be detected in the CSF and overexpression of glutathione metabolic enzymes in the hippocampus of TLE-HS patients, indicating a more global state of OS in the brain. 4-HNE represents a marker of lipid peroxidation, a process previously implicated in iron-catalyzed regulated necrosis, termed ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is prevented via system Xc\u2212-mediated cysteine import, the key metabolite in glutathione synthesis required for lipid-ROS detoxification by lipid peroxidases. In turn, system Xc\u2212 is a glutamate/cysteine antiporter, hence elevated extracellular glutamate concentrations in epilepsy could not only promote excitotoxicity but also facilitate ferroptosis. While the exact cell-death mechanism of pyknotic neurons in TLE-HS is unclear, previous studies demonstrated that specifically hilar GABAergic neurons, a neuronal subtype whose dysfunction is supposed to play a pro-epileptogenic role in patients with TLE and animal models of acquired epilepsy, seem to be highly sensitive to ferroptosis. A protective response of the brain might require upregulation of the catalytic subunit of system Xc\u2212, xCT, for sufficient glutathione synthesis. This is in line with the detected overexpression of glutathione metabolism on total hippocampal RNA and protein in TLE-HS tissue. Moreover, only a fraction of 4-HNE-positive neurons exhibited pyknotic morphology, suggesting elevated lipid peroxidation does not automatically predestine cells for necrosis. Besides 4-HNE, neurons also showed high expression of HO-1, an acute stress protein whose transcription is regulated by antioxidant defense systems like the Nrf-2 signaling pathway. Importantly, HO-1 represents a key enzyme in the acute antioxidant response releasing iron in the process. Consequently, acute HO-1 expression is involved in detoxification, while chronic Nrf-2-dependent HO-1 overexpression induces iron release and paradoxically was shown to accelerate oxidative damage and ferroptosis. Thus, in addition to extrinsic seizure-mediated iron ingress via BBB leakage, neurons might also be confronted with iron overload via intrinsic enzyme-mediated iron release.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 89710, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Iron accumulation and ferritin expression in glia implicate increased iron-binding capacity of astrocytes in SE and TLE-HS tissue", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 89840, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A principle finding in SE and TLE-HS brain tissue was a prominent shift in the localization of ferritin expression from microglia and oligodendrocytes in autopsy control tissue to markedly higher expression in astrocytes. Microglia were shown to upregulate ferritin expression in experimental epilepsy models. In addition, astrocytes appear to dynamically acquire the capacity to sequester iron in SE and TLE-HS. Interestingly, astrocytic ferritin overexpression was accompanied by a decrease in total ferritin gene and protein expression in TLE-HS hippocampi. One explanation for the reduction of total ferritin might be that iron sequestration via microglia is dysfunctional or overloaded in epilepsy, either because of higher brain iron load due to seizures or altered microglial iron homeostasis. In this context, recent developments in single cell transcriptomics revealed that microglial subtypes show more distinct changes in homeostatic functions during pathological situations, which could include iron metabolism. This shift in iron handling from microglia to astrocytes is supported by a previous report studying multiple sclerosis brains, which revealed a similar function for reactive astrocytes as iron-storing cells. Besides iron and ferritin, TLE-HS tissue also displayed lower RNA expression of TFRC and higher expression of DMT-1 in epileptogenic tissue. TFRC is involved in transferrin-dependent Fe3+ iron uptake, while DMT-1 facilitates endosomal iron export, but also direct transmembrane entry of Fe2+ into cells. Immunohistochemistry of TFRC and DMT-1 revealed low neuronal TFRC and higher TFRC and DMT-1 expression in astrocytes. DMT-1 shuttles Fe2+ while TFRC transports transferrin bound Fe3+, thus, indicating either a shift in the brains Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio or changes in iron handling such as an increased need to rapidly take up Fe2+ or metabolize endosomal Fe2+. Strong DMT-1 and TFRC expression in astrocytes suggests higher glial uptake of iron, while overall lower TFRC might be explained by neuronal loss but also reduced expression including other cell types such as endothelial cells. Additionally, higher FPN-1 RNA expression might indicate enhanced cellular iron export. The intimate interaction of astrocytes with the BBB and their consequent improved ability to control iron flux as compared to microglia could be another explanation for the shift of iron sequestration to astrocytes in epilepsy. Interestingly, strong TFRC expression in punctate, astrocytic end-feet around the microvasculature could be detected, which might indicate a shift in control over iron shuttling from endothelium to astrocytes in epilepsy. In addition to SE/TLE-HS tissue, TBI and stroke lesions were studied, since brain tissue from both injuries typically exhibit brain iron overload due to hemorrhages. Notably, iron accumulation and ferritin expression in TBI and stroke lesions was detected in macrophages/microglia acutely, while astrocytes overexpressed ferritin in older lesions.

FPN-1-mediated iron secretion is hepcidin (HAMP) and redox dependent, mainly mediated by the ferroxidases hephaestin (HEPH) or ceruloplasmin (CP). CP was shown to be expressed predominantly in astrocytes and its lack thereof promoting astrocytic iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia. Thus, CP downregulation might promote iron retention specifically in astrocytes. On the other hand, HAMP downregulation, which promotes FPN-1 internalization, and HEPH overexpression support increased iron secretion in other cell types. Interestingly, the transcriptomic data also revealed that of the family of antioxidant peroxiredoxins, solely PRX6 was found to be upregulated in TLE-HS hippocampi. PRX6 constitutes the only glutathione-dependent peroxiredoxin that has high affinity for lipid hydroperoxides. Thus, the strong expression of PRX6 in astrocytes supports their high glutathione-dependent antioxidant capacity in TLE-HS. Notably, RNA sequencing showed a large heterogeneity between TLE-HS cases revealing distinct sub-clusters.

In concordance with the current literature, this change in magnetic susceptibility might indicate an increased accumulation of brain iron temporally and spatially associated with the epileptic seizure. Notably, magnetic susceptibility of Fe2+ and Fe3+ were shown to be similar, thus not allowing a precise discrimination between oxidation states. Current evidence for acute BBB dysfunction and consequent iron influx upon brain insults such as TBI or SE is strong, while prolonged BBB opening was demonstrated to play a role in epileptogenesis and aggravation of the epileptic condition. Moreover, brain intrinsic alterations in iron handling such as HO-1-mediated iron release or also iron release from iron-sulfur clusters in stressed mitochondria might impact the seizure-associated increase in QSM signal. The presented QSM data clearly demonstrate an increased susceptibility as a consequence of seizure activity in vivo, while data from epilepsy brain tissue suggests alterations in iron homeostasis temporally independent of the seizure. This finding likely represents a symptom of ongoing BBB dysfunction in combination with dysfunctional clearance of postictal iron. Here, accumulated iron could contribute to increased excitability by impairing astrocytic function (e.g. reduced potassium buffering) or by stimulating neuroinflammation, as supported by the in vitro data.

This finding could be explained by the difference in Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio since the method for measuring total iron detects both ionization states, whereas the Perl\u2019s staining only detects Fe3+. Based on these differences, it could be assumed that more Fe2+ is present during the chronic stage, potentially mediated by an altered brain redox state. Ferritin expression was almost exclusively found in microglia and only occasionally in astrocytes when SRS occurred, though at much lower numbers than in human brain tissue. Thus, higher FTH-1 expression during the latent stage might be attributable to activated microglia, as also shown by previous studies, even before the onset of SRS. Here, FTH-1 upregulation was detected also after the development of SRS, when neuronal loss is minimal, implicating altered iron metabolism in the pathogenesis and progression of epilepsy. Another contributing factor to the increase in iron during the acute stage might also be HO-1, which was strongly overexpressed by reactive astrocytes. In contrast to tissue iron, RNA expression of iron metabolic genes and xCT was highest in the latent phase. Altogether, these data suggest a strong iron influx acutely post-SE, followed by iron metabolism/removal in the latent stage and, finally, chronic, low iron influx after the development of SRS. Contrary to human tissue, astrocytes appear to play a less important role in iron sequestration in this model which may be explained by the difference in i.e. seizure focus, epilepsy duration and differences in astrocyte competence in handling iron between rodents and humans.

Although previous reports demonstrated epileptogenic potential of intracortical iron injections in experimental animals, we did not find evidence for acute ictogenic properties of ferric iron in hippocampal slices. However, neurons in acute hippocampal slice preparations stimulated with FAC revealed neuronal iron uptake primarily into nuclei and nucleoli, further pinpointing the nucleus as potential site of neuronal iron storage. These findings support that neurons could rapidly take up ferric iron upon excessive, local exposure as also seen in SHSY5Y cells. Moreover, SHSY5Y cells also displayed altered mitochondrial ultrastructure without impaired viability upon FAC exposure. Assuming BBB leakage, iron accumulation in neurons of TLE-HS patients is probably a slow, chronic process that is likely accompanied and influenced by other epileptogenic events such as altered redox status, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, etc. Since Fe3+-citrate is known to be a substantial component of blood, this way of iron exposure could be feasible. Additionally, seizure-mediated dysfunction of iron clearance and metabolism in brain cells might induce iron accumulation. Hence, we conclude that iron accumulation represents a consequence of seizures. The fact that hemin treatment did not lead to neuronal iron uptake indicates the importance of the iron-donating molecule as iron bound to the protoporphyrin ring of hemin requires enzymatic degradation via HO-1 for release.

Additionally, VGCCs, which are also implicated in epilepsy, were shown to facilitate neuronal iron uptake. Using inhibitors of VGCCs and NMDA receptors we could not detect a reduction of iron uptake upon treatment with Glu, suggesting other, possibly unspecific routes of entry. Of note, while no ictogenic propensity of FAC was detected on the hippocampal network level, iron was shown to be involved in modulating synaptic excitability in physiological conditions at the cellular level. An additional finding in hippocampal slices was the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression upon FAC stimulation and an exacerbation of this effect when paired with 4-AP or Glu.

Moreover, HMGB-1 release coupled to higher expression of IL-6 and C3 indicate that chronic iron coupled to OS might promote neuroinflammation. Elevated secretion of HMGB-1 could also be found in SHSY5Y cells treated with FAC/GO, but in contrast to astrocytes also hemin/H2O2. Importantly, HMGB-1 disulfide formation is facilitated by OS, which can activate the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-HMGB-1 axis in neurons promoting hyperexcitability, excitotoxicity and seizures. Thus, inflammatory changes in astrocytes coupled to secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns such as HMGB-1 might be associated with astrocytic iron accumulation in epileptogenic brain tissue. Importantly, in conjunction with the proposed iron-catalyzed exacerbation of ROS, astrocytic expression of antioxidant, iron metabolism and pro-inflammatory genes was higher when co-treated rather than with ROS or iron alone. Another link between antioxidant and pro-inflammatory signaling might be the overexpression of PRX6 in astrocytes identified from transcriptomics since PRX6 possesses phospholipase A2 activity which could be involved in the synthesis of inflammatory lipid mediators. Interestingly, previous studies demonstrated that pro-inflammatory activation can promote iron-buffering and resistance to OS in astrocytes. Thus, pro-inflammatory gene expression might reflect a homeostatic mechanism which, when activated chronically, could ultimately contribute to the progression of the disease.
