Yet their efficacy is often limited by poor immunogenicity, attributed to inadequate priming and generation of antitumor T cells by dendritic cells (DCs). Identifying biomarkers to enhance DC functions in such tumors is thus crucial. Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), recognized for its influence on immune cells, has an underexplored relationship with DCs. Our research reveals a correlation between high TIMP1 levels in metastatic melanoma and increased CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration and survival. Network studies indicate a functional connection with HLA genes. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of a national melanoma cohort revealed that TIMP1 expression in immune compartments associates with an HLA-A/MHC-I peptide loading signature in lymph nodes. Primary human and bone-marrow-derived DCs secrete TIMP-1, which notably increases MHC-I expression in classical type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), especially under melanoma antigen exposure. TIMP-1 affects the immunoproteasome/TAP complex, as seen by upregulated PSMB8 and TAP-1 levels of myeloid DCs. This study uncovers the role of TIMP-1 in DC-mediated immunogenicity with insights into CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell activation, providing a foundation for mechanistic exploration and highlighting its potential as a new target for combinatorial immunotherapy to enhance ICT effectiveness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1559, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1572, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has transformed advanced solid tumor treatment. In melanoma, combined anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab) therapies result in a five-year survival rate of 52%. Yet, many metastatic melanoma patients either resist or relapse post-ICT, with only the ones with BRAF mutation in tumors qualifying for targeted therapies as a standard of care. Approximately 53% of these patients show ICT resistance due to T cell exclusion mechanisms. Such \u201ccold\u201d tumors, characterized by a nonimmunogenic tumor microenvironment (TME) and minimal immune infiltration, are invariably resistant to ICT. Recently, we discussed how cancer cells foster these cold tumors, via T cell desertification, where they regulate suppressive elements inhibiting dendritic cells (DCs) from effectively presenting tumor neoantigens to T cells, causing reduced anti-tumor T cell expansion. This compromised DC functionality can culminate in immune-desert tumors, marked by a dearth of anti-tumor immunity and unresponsiveness to ICT.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2632, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Research efforts have been placed on identifying new pathways and biomarkers that enhance the immunogenic activities of DCs in the TME. To this end, combinatorial methods have been developed, leveraging the discovery of these biomarkers. These approaches often involve strategies like drug infusions or gene therapies to elevate their presence in the TME. In this context, the Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) has recently emerged as a potential immune functional biomarker. While traditionally recognized for its primary role in inhibiting metalloproteinases, recent findings highlight TIMP-1 as a promising cytokine interacting with multiple cell-surface receptors and co-receptors, including CD63, LRP1, and CD74. Notably, all these receptors have been previously described to play critical roles in the immunogenic functions of myeloid DCs.

Using NanoString GeoMX, we found TIMP1 expression in the immune compartment of the TME, which corresponded to higher immunogenicity in lymph nodes (LN) due to its association with MHC-I peptide loading, indicating TIMP-1\u2019s possible impact on melanoma immunogenicity through DC priming. We further demonstrated that both T cells and DCs secrete TIMP-1 and that its soluble form increased the expression of MHC-I in myeloid DCs, exposed to tumor antigens, highlighting its potential to enhance antigen presentation in DCs, particularly in classical type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1). Initial mechanistic investigations reveal that TIMP-1 exerts modulatory effects on PSMB8 and TAP-1, constituents of the immunoproteasome/TAP complex. These findings are consistent with the functional associations predicted by cross-tissue spatial analysis within our national melanoma cohort and preliminary cross-presentation and T cell activation studies.
