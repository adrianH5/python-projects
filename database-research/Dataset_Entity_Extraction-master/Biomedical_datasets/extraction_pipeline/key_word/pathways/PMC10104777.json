Using a systems biology approach, we provide a holistic overview of gene co-expression networks in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of HNSCC RNA sequencing data from 519 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to determine correlates of 5-year survival, using regression tree-based optimal threshold calculations. Survival-associated gene sets were transformed to gene set scores that were assessed for correlation with clinicopathological data. We identified 8 gene co-expression modules for HNSCC tumors, each of which contained co-expressed genes associated significantly with 5-year survival. Survival-associated co-expression gene signatures correlated dominantly with tumor HPV and p16 status. Network analysis identified that survival was associated with signaling networks of infection, immunity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, glycolysis, focal adhesion, extracellular matrix, MYC signaling, autophagy and transcriptional regulation. EMT-associated gene signatures were expressed dominantly in fibroblasts, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were inversely correlated with immune activity. Interestingly, a high Immune Suppression Score based on expression of 21 genes associated with immune inhibition and including immune checkpoints, cytokines and regulatory T cell factors, was also associated with increased survival probability, and was significantly higher in HPV+\u2009HNSCC. Networks associated with HNSCC survival were further associated with survival in cervical cancer, melanoma and lung cancer. This study defines 5129 genes associated with HNSCC survival, organized into co-expressed networks, their correlation with clinicopathological data, and with gene expression data from other malignant diseases, and provides a source for the discovery of biomarkers and novel therapies for HNSCC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2283, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2296, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are the sixth leading cause of cancers, and more than 600,000 new cases are diagnosed yearly worldwide.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2447, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "HNSCC are a diverse group of malignant diseases that are located at various anatomical sites in the mucosal linings of the upper aero digestive tract.

An increasing proportion of HNSCC, however, is associated with persistent infection with oncogenic HPVs, and it is acknowledged that HPV+ HNSCC have a better prognosis than HPV\u2212 HNSCC. This was confirmed in the current study, where HPV+ HNSCC defined by either presence of HPV viral sequences or p16 expression (as a recognized surrogate for HPV-associated cancer) was correlated strongly with survival. HPV status was in fact the dominant clinicopathological trait that correlated with survival-associated gene co-expression networks. Specifically, gene networks where high expression was associated with increased survival were highly correlated with HPV+ HNSCC, and gene networks where high expression was associated with decreased survival were highly correlated with HPV\u2212 HNSCC. In contrast, tobacco, alcohol use, or clinical and pathology stage, did not correlate with the survival-associated gene co-expression networks, and future studies exploring gene-environment associations may inform these relationships more specifically. Of note, this study was not powered to determine the effect of different HPV genotypes on survival-associated gene co-expression networks, as 82% of HPV+ samples expressed viral sequences of HPV16, and very few samples (n\u2009=\u200913) expressed other HPV genotypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30765, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We describe in detail three survival-associated gene co-expression networks in the current study; an immune module, an EMT module and a module rich in transcription factors and metabolic proteins.

Thus, paradoxically, immune-cell infiltrated HNSCC that co-expresses high levels of some immune-inhibitory gene transcripts have a better survival prognosis than HNSCC without any immune activity, regardless of whether the gene expression profile would be predicted to be immune stimulating or immune inhibitory. This observation is in line with our previous study in cervical squamous cancers, where we identified many of the same immune suppressive genes that were positively associated with survival.

This is in line with the observation that HPV\u2212 HNSCC is less radiosensitive, where hypoxia is a recognized factor that reduces radiosensitivity. We acknowledge that gene expression does not always correlate with protein expression, and that the TCGA gene expression data do not offer spatial or cellular resolution for a more concise analysis of inter-cellular signaling in space. We therefore integrated HNSCC single-cell transcriptomic data to identify specific cell populations that are enriched with specific survival-associated gene co-expression networks, and identified that gene expression of the EMT module was dominantly enriched in CAFs with contractile properties (myofibroblasts), confirmed by expression of the fibroblast-activation protein (FAP) gene in the EMT module. This observation is consistent with an observed higher density of CAFs in HNSCC, associated with advanced tumor stage, nodal infiltration, clinical stage, vascular invasion and poor differentiation. CAFs develop alongside epithelial cancer cells and acquire an activated phenotype, and persistently activated CAFs produce extracellular matrix components, resulting in compartmentalization of tumor nests that hinder immune cell infiltration. Indeed, we observed negative correlations between proportions of CAFs and T cells, and between a CAF score and the immune score, suggesting that one may lead to the exclusion of the other. CAFs can originate from epithelial cancer cells by transdifferentiating into myofibroblasts under oxidative stress. CAFs can also originate from endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells or adipocytes, and hence represent a heterogeneous group of cells that can drive EMT, invasion and metastasis. CAFs also produce chemokines and cytokines, recruiting and polarizing immune cells towards immune suppression. This might explain why a high Immune Score, overall associated with increased survival, was not strongly negatively correlated with a high EMT score in our analysis.

In a nutrient-deficient environment, however, autophagy can lead to an increase of nutrient availability by facilitating catabolism and promoting angiogenesis, thereby promoting tumor progression.
