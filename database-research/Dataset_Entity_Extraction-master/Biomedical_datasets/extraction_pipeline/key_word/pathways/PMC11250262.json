Menarche normally occurs between ages 10 and 15 years, and its variation is associated with risks of several health outcomes, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hormone-sensitive cancers. Thus, widespread secular trends toward earlier puberty timing may have an important impact on public health. AAM is a highly polygenic trait, and previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~400 common genetic loci, the vast majority of which were discovered in samples of European ancestry. AAM has a strong genetic correlation with male puberty timing (rg\u2009=\u20090.68), as well as with adiposity (body mass index (BMI), rg\u2009=\u2009\u22120.35), and specific pathways have been identified that link nutrient sensing to reproductive hormone axis activation.
