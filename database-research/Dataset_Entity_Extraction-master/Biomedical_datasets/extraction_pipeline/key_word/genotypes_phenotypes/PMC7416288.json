This study was aimed at elucidating the regulatory network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA and identifying the precise inflammation-related targets in GC. The expression profiles of GSE83521, GSE78091, and GSE33651 were obtained from the GEO database. Interactions between miRNAs and circRNAs were investigated by the Circular RNA Interactome, and targets of miRNAs were predicted with miRTarBase. Then, a circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory network was constructed. Also, functional enrichment analysis of selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed. The inflammation-/GC-related targets were collected in the GeneCards and GenLiP3 database, respectively. And a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DE mRNAs was constructed with STRING and Cytoscape to identify hub genes. The genetic alterations, neighboring gene networks, expression levels, and the poor prognosis of hub genes were investigated in cBioPortal, Oncomine, and Human Protein Atlas databases and Kaplan-Meier plotter, respectively. A total of 10 DE miRNAs and 33 DEGs were identified. The regulatory network contained 26 circRNAs, 10 miRNAs, and 1459 mRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the selected 33 DEGs were involved in negative regulation of fat cell differentiation, response to wounding, extracellular matrix- (ECM-) receptor interaction, and regulation of cell growth pathways. THBS1, FN1, CALM1, COL4A1, CTGF, and IGFBP5 were selected as inflammation-related hub genes of GC in the PPI network. The genetic alterations in these hub genes were related to amplification and missense mutations. Furthermore, the genes RYR2, ERBB2, PI3KCA, and HELZ2 were connected to hub genes in this study. The hub gene levels in clinical specimens were markedly upregulated in GC tissues and correlated with poor overall survival (OS). Our results suggest that THBS1, FN1, CALM1, COL4A1, CTGF, and IGFBP5 were associated with the pathogenesis of gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as biomarkers and inflammation-related targets for GC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2219, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

GC displays high heterogeneity with respect to histopathological and epidemiological characteristics and can be divided into proximal nondiffuse, diffuse, and distal nondiffuse subtypes. Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) is the primary pathological type associated with environmental factors, including a high-salt diet, infectious agents, and smoking, and this form of GC is characterized by ease of invasion and metastasis and a very low early diagnosis rate. Despite the tremendous efforts that have been paid in the diagnosis of GC, together with improvements in surgical techniques and targeted chemotherapy in recent years, the prognosis of patients with GC remains unsatisfactory due to the prevalence of diagnosis of the disease at advanced stages that are often accompanied by lymphatic metastasis, which limits successful therapeutic strategies. Additionally, cancer-related systemic inflammation is recognized as a flag sign of cancer-related cachexia development and progression, which results in an inappropriate systemic reaction, including fevers, weight loss, and sweats. Therefore, further exploration of appropriate molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis and identification of potential inflammation-related targets of GC are urgently needed to expand the promising strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and clinical prognosis in patients with GA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3780, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel type of endogenous, noncoding RNA, which is also widely expressed in different species and has been demonstrated to belong to a class of RNAs with tissue-/developmental-stage specificity, making them potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a special type of small noncoding RNAs comprising approximately 21 nucleotides that bind to the 3\u2032-untranslated regions (3\u2032-UTRs) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and leading to mRNA degradation or blocking of translation, which contribute to the central regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies have revealed that the abundance and evolutionary conservation of circRNAs play significant effects in regulating cancer progression-related processes such as metastasis, apoptosis, and invasion and that circRNAs primarily function as miRNA sponges, thereby relieving miRNA-mediated target repression. For instance, circRNA-ZFR serves as a sponge of miR-130a/miR-107 and modulates PTEN expression, resulting in the suppression of GC cell proliferation and the promotion of apoptosis. Another report by Zhang et al. showed that circRNA-LARP4 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion in GC by sequestering miR-424-5p and regulating LATS1 expression. Besides, it has been reported that knockdown of ciRS-133 reduced cancer cachexia by activating PRDM16 and suppressing miR-133 in tumor-implanted mice.

Additionally, inflammation has long been recognized to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Hence, the identification of novel diagnostic markers and inflammation-related targets and the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of GC onset and progression have become major topics in GC research.
