This conformation is driven by a temperature-dependent Ca2+-binding site in the intracellular domain, and is essential for TRPM4 function in physiological contexts. We demonstrated that ligands, exemplified by decavanadate (a positive modulator) and ATP (an inhibitor), bind to different locations of TRPM4 at physiological temperatures than at lower temperatures, and that these sites have bona fide functional relevance. We elucidated the TRPM4 gating mechanism by capturing structural snapshots of its different functional states at physiological temperatures, revealing the channel opening that is not observed at lower temperatures.

In the cold conformation, ATP bound at the interface between the MHR1/2 domain and the adjacent MHR3/4 domain, consistent with the previous findings. At this ATPcold site, the adenosine moiety of ATP was tightly encapsulated in a cleft in the MHR1/2 domain, forming extensive hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with surrounding residues, while its triphosphate tail loosely engaged with a positively charged cap (Arg421) on the adjacent MHR3/4 domain. The transition to the warm conformation shifted the MHR1/2 domain toward the TMD, moving the \u2018adenosine cleft\u2019 to near the N-terminal tip of the rib helix. Notably, this movement also transferred ATP within the cleft to this new location, ATPwarm (Fig. 5c).

The identification of the open-state structure of TRPM4 at physiological temperature underscores the importance of the cold-to-warm transition in channel activation. However, the precise interplay of temperature and Ca2+ during this transition remains to be further explored. A plausible explanation is that elevated temperatures may weaken the intersubunit interface in the cold conformation, potentially facilitating, in conjunction with Cawarm binding, the transition to the warm conformation with new intersubunit interfaces. The cold-to-warm transition of TRPM4 also profoundly affects its ligand recognition, highlighted by the identification of temperature-dependent binding for ligands across three principal categories: Ca2+, the endogenous agonist; DVT, a positive modulator; and ATP, an inhibitor.
