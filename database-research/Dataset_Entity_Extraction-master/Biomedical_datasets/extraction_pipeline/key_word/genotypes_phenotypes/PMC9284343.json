G-protein effectors have been recently reported in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, less information is available from polyploid crop species having complex networks of G-protein components. Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) is a well-characterized GTPase accelerating protein, which plays an important role in the regulation of the G-protein cycle in plants. In the present study, four homologs encoding RGS proteins were isolated from the allotetraploid Brassica juncea, a globally important oilseed, vegetable, and condiment crop. The B. juncea RGS proteins were grouped into distinct BjuRGS1 and BjuRGS2 orthologous clades, and the expression of BjuRGS1 homologs was predominantly higher than BjuRGS2 homologs across the tested tissue types of B. juncea. Utilizing B. juncea Y2H library screening, a total of 30 nonredundant interacting proteins with the RGS-domain of the highly expressed BjuA.RGS1 was identified. Gene ontology analysis indicated that these effectors exerted various molecular, cellular, and physiological functions. Many of them were known to regulate cell wall metabolism (BjuEXP6, Bju-\u03b1-MAN, BjuPGU4, BjuRMS3) and phosphorylation-mediated cell signaling (BjuMEK4, BjuDGK3, and BjuKinase).

The metabolic changes in the cell wall play an important role in plant development, particularly during fruit ripening and silique maturation. These changes are mediated by various cell wall synthesis, loosening, and degrading enzymes, which control the overall dynamics of fruit and silique maturation and dehiscence. In our study, multiple cell wall synthesis and degrading enzymes like BjuEXP6, Bju-\u03b1-MAN, BjuPGU4, and BjuRMS3, were identified as the interacting partner for BjuA.RGS1box+Ct domain. Interaction of these proteins could possibly activate the heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and their associated downstream components, which eventually regulate the cell wall metabolism during the pod maturation stage in Brassica species. Earlier, Klopffleisch et al. through Y2H library screening also identified various interacting partners of G-protein components that are involved in cell wall metabolism. Besides, the identification of interacting proteins like BjuGGDR, BjuASP2, BjuGLN1, and BjuSAsoMet2 in the current study suggests the probable involvement of the identified BjuRGS1-targets in other biosynthetic processes of B. juncea.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24629, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Furthermore, various kinases like BjuMEK4, BjuDGK3, and serine/threonine-protein kinase were also found to interact with the BjuA.RGS1box+Ct domain (Table 2).

The protein kinases identified in the present study could play an important role in the phosphorylation of BjuA.RGS1, resulting in its separation from cognate G\u03b1 protein, thereby reinforcing phosphorylation-based activation and deactivation regulation of the G-protein cycle in plants, which needs further investigation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25246, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The proteins that are interacting with each other could possess similar biological functions, and cellular localization, and are more likely to be coexpressed.

The BjuEF1B2, BjuExp6, BjuAIP, BjuGGDR, and BjuSAdoMet2 genes show profound expression in different tissue types.
