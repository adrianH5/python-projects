There was a large overlap in the profiles for the two cell types; 156 proteins were quantified only in osteoblasts and 111 proteins only for the MSCs. The osteoblast-specific proteins included several extracellular matrix proteins and a network including 27 proteins that influence intracellular signaling (Wnt/Notch/Bone morphogenic protein pathways) and bone mineralization. The osteoblasts and MSCs showed only minor age- and sex-dependent proteomic differences. Finally, the osteoblast and MSC proteomic profiles were altered by ex vivo culture in serum-free media. We conclude that although the proteomic profiles of osteoblasts and MSCs show many similarities, we identified several osteoblast-specific extracellular matrix proteins and an osteoblast-specific intracellular signaling network.

Hematopoietic cells have a hierarchical organization, and the minor subsets of normal or leukemic stem cells within these hierarchical populations localize to specialized stem cell niches formed by bone marrow stromal cells. The niches have traditionally been divided into two main types, the osteoblastic or endosteal and the vascular or sinusoidal niche. These two microenvironments seem to have different functions with regard to regulation of stem cell homeostasis, i.e., quiescence and maintenance versus proliferation/differentiation, respectively. A third arteriolar niche has recently been described where periarteriolar stromal cells are important; this niche also seems to maintain quiescence. Osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are members of these stem cell niches. Furthermore, the extracellular matrix is also important for regulation of hematopoiesis through their effects on communication between various bone marrow cells and regulation of hematopoietic cell localization. Thus, bone marrow stromal cells are important both through their cell\u2013cell contacts, extracellular release of specific soluble mediators/proteins (e.g., growth and/or differentiation factors), and formation of the extracellular matrix.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2942, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Even though osteoblasts differentiate from MSCs, experimental studies suggest that these two cell types differ in their molecular mechanisms for support of normal hematopoiesis. Furthermore, both MSCs and osteoblasts can support carcinogenesis and development of cancer chemoresistance, including homing of circulating cancer cells to the bone marrow with later development of metastases as well as the development of myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Targeting of this protective bone marrow microenvironment and the stroma-cancer cell interactions (e.g., blockade by specific monoclonal antibodies) should therefore be considered as a possible therapeutic strategy. Thus, targeting of osteoblasts and/or MSCs is now considered a possible strategy in the treatment of malignant disorders but also nonmalignant bone diseases, e.g., osteoporosis.

Third, TLR4 initiated signaling is involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and function. Several such immunoregulatory mediators are also included in an osteoblast-specific protein\u2013protein interaction network (see Figure 2; CD14, TANK, TRAF6) together with immunoregulatory HLA molecules.

Furthermore, the osteoblast-specific/associated proteins identified in our present study included several extracellular matrix molecules, and similar differences are also reflected in the osteoblast/MSCs secretomas.
