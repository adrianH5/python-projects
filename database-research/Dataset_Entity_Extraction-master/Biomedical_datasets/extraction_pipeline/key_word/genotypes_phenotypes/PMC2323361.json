It is important for discovery of vaccines and immunotherapies. Tens of thousands of protein variants have been characterized in viruses, such as HIV, influenza, or dengue. The numbers of bacterial, fungal, and parasite antigens are even larger. Several hundred of tumor-related antigens and their variants have been reported. More than two thousand variants of human MHC (HLA) have been characterized to date. Given the significant number of antigens and their variants, and a large number of HLA variants, systematic experimental testing of binding capacity of these peptides is impractical. A number of computational methods have been developed to facilitate the identification of MHC binding peptides. More than thirty prediction servers have been developed and are accessible via the Internet. These methods use a variety of statistical and machine learning approaches making computational pre-screening of antigens for CTL epitopes a standard approach in epitope-mapping studies. However, with so many choices of prediction servers, new questions have arisen: how to select the best server for a particular HLA allele; can they be used to predict binding affinity of peptides rather than classify into binders and non-binders; and how to use predictions to identify T-cell epitopes amongst HLA ligands? Lack of standards for the development of MHC-I binding predictors resulted in servers that show differences in predictions values and the wide scale of prediction values. Comparisons of methods for prediction of MHC-binding peptides have been reported, indicating high accuracy of binding predictions. Predictions of T-cell epitopes, which are a subset of MHC-binders are less accurate and more difficult to model than peptide binding predictions. In a recent study using HLA class I (HLA-I) transgenic mice, 40 candidate T-cell epitopes were identified from computational screening of some 2,900 peptides. Of these 21 were identified as T-cell epitopes and 17 were high-affinity HLA-binders. A new generation of predictive models that combine predictions of multiple antigen processing and presentation steps: HLA binding, peptide binding to transported associated with antigen processing (TAP) and predictions of proteasomal cleavage have been developed (reviewed in). While combination of HLA predictions and TAP predictions offers improvement of predictions in some cases, it eliminates TAP-independent peptides from further analysis, such as those produced by vacuolar, lysosomal, or endosomal, among others, pathways. Proteasomal cleavage predictions are of much lower accuracy than HLA-binding or TAP-binding predictions; proteasomal cleavage methods have not yet been adequately validated. The utility and the mode of usage of combined predictors are yet to be determined.

Trost et al., on the other hand, compared the performance of sixteen servers, and combined predictions by a number of tools into a more accurate combined method. Because of the lack of adequate independent test sets, the comparison studies performed to date have been based on assessing predictive performance using pre-defined sets of peptides, rather than full-overlapping studies of complete antigens. In this study we compared the performance of 30 servers by first normalizing the predictions to a common scale and then assessing the performance using the data from a full-overlapping binding study of 9-mer peptides to seven HLA-I molecules. These peptides were derived from a tumor antigen and from a fragment of a viral antigen. We compared all the servers to find whether any of them produce identical predictions. The main part of the study explored the classification (prediction into binders and non-binders) vs. peptide binding affinity prediction capabilities of these servers.

For example MAPPP and ProPred1 predict multiple steps of antigen processing, MULTIPRED predicts peptide binding to HLA supertypes, and BIMAS predicts peptide binding as half-time dissociation (off-rate). Some servers have advanced options, for example MHCPred enables the specification of anchor positions. For this analysis we used the simplest prediction method available at each server. After performing all predictions using the test set, we first calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient for all the servers and found that MAPPP (BIMAS) and MAPPP (SYFPEITHI) showed identical predictions (r = 1) to BIMAS and SYFPEITHI, respectively. The ProPred1 and BIMAS predictions showed r \u2265 0.998 for six HLA-I molecules, r = 0.25 for B*0702, while B*1501 were not available in ProPred1. This was as expected because BIMAS and SYFPEITHI matrices were adopted by MAPPP servers and BIMAS matrices in ProPred1 as HLA-I binding prediction tools.

Experimental measurements from the iTopia\u2122 are expressed as the concentration of peptide needed to achieve 50% binding (ED50 value) and compared as percentage binding affinity relative to the positive control peptide. For example, the binding scores for BIMAS represent off-rates (minutes), IEDB and NETM_ANN servers represent binding affinity on a nanomolar scales, MHC I server predicts \"binding energy\", while MULTIPRED server predicts an arbitrary binding score. Large discrepancies are observed even between predictors from the same server. For example the survivin1\u20139 peptide MGAPTLPPA is an experimental binder to A*0201 with estimated 94% affinity relative to the positive control. The respective predictions for IEDB_ANN, IEDB_ARB, and IEDB_SMM are 23441, 365, and 3237 nM, while NETM_ANN predicted value is 8574 nM.

Obviously these predictors must be treated as different in silico assays and the comparison can be made only by using relative scales of predictions. Using iTopia\u2122 binding assay as the experimental control, we calculated correlation coefficients for all available predictors for three data sets (survivin, CMV construct, and the combined data set). The results show that a high accuracy prediction of peptide binding affinity can be achieved for A*0201 (Figure 4) where IEDB_ANN and NETM_ANN show values of r > 0.8 while A*0201 predictors MHCI_MM, MULTI_ANN, MULTI_SVM, NETM_WM, and SYFPEITHI showed a relatively high correlation coefficient of 0.8 < r < 0.7.

predictors. Group A (BIMAS, MHC_BP, and NHP_ANN) have the majority of predictions clustered at the top of the graph with the nearly horizontal trend line. Although these predictors may provide good prediction of accuracy with carefully selected threshold, however this threshold is difficult to determine. The predictions are of low sensitivity, but relatively high specificity because of a small numbers of TP and FP, and large numbers of TN and FN. Group B (IEDB_SMM, IEDB_ARB, MHCP_I and MHCP_AA) have majority of predictions clustered along the bottom of the graph with the nearly horizontal trend line. Again, these predictions may show good classification accuracy but it is difficult to identify the appropriate threshold. The predictions are typically of high sensitivity and low specificity because of the large number of TP and FP, and small numbers of TN and FN. Group C numbers of (MHC_BPS, MULTI_HMM, NHP_CP, PEPDIST, PREDEP, SVMHC_M, and SVMHC_S) have predictions clustered horizontally or as a cloud with the nearly horizontal trend line. These predictors show moderate accuracy of predictions irrespective of the selected threshold. Finally, the remaining predictors form group D which show the distribution of predictions across the diagonal with a trend line showing slope from non binders to high binders. The accuracy of these predictors is moderate to high with a reasonable balance of TP, TN, FP, and FN. However, these results need to be taken with a note of caution, because some of the T-cell epitopes used for the comparison are likely to be included in the training sets for server development.

Non-linear algorithms, in particular ANNs appear to offer advantage for prediction of peptide binding affinity. Recently developed algorithms are generally work to be done, since in silico assays that match contemporary experimental accuracy are available only for single HLA*0201 9-mer peptides. We have also identified the problems with some prediction methods (Figure 6): group A predictors suffer from low sensitivity and can be improved by re-training their prediction engines with new data, particularly binders; group B suffers from low specificity and these models can be improved by retraining with larger number of non-binders; group C can be further improved by retraining with larger number of training data; while group D can be improved by further improvement of algorithms, while addition of new data is likely to offer only a small gradual improvement for this group. The combination of predictions from high-accuracy predictors is likely to be a major direction for improvement of predictions other than for A*0201.

In this schema, the negative control peptide maps to 0, while the positive control peptide maps to 100. Binders of higher affinity than the positive control will have binding score greater than 100. The interpretation of the normalized scores is clearer than the raw scores for examples shown in Table 1, 2, 3. Appropriate scaling of outputs also provides practical benefits: a number of predictors that theoretically have good or excellent predictive performance when analyzed in fine detail. However, for those that belong to predictor groups A, B, or C (Figure 6) it is difficult to determine the best threshold for classification predictions because the threshold zone between \"good\" and \"poor\" predictions is narrow, rather than wide as in group D predictors.

HLA-A*0201 restricted T-cell epitopes have been extracted from the literature and contain 85 well-characterized tumor antigen-related peptides and 44 well-characterized viral T-cell epitopes (see supplemental materials in Additional file 1). Several predictors do not have information on specific genotype alleles but have predictions for serotypes. For instance, the prediction results generated by SMM are actually the binding affinities of peptides to HLA-A2, not exclusively HLA-A*0201. Such approximation may affect their specificity in predicting HLA-A*0201 epitopes to some extent.
