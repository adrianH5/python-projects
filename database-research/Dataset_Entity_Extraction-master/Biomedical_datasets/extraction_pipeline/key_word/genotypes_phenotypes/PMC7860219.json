Current studies and epidemiologic investigations showed that these symptoms are closely related to intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) mediated neurological defects. IDD is initiated by a series of pathogenic processes including biological, biochemical and structural impairment that eventually causes imbalanced metabolism of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the intervertebral disc, thus manifesting as collapsed disc and incapability of maintaining movement. The nucleus pulposus (NP) region of the disc is most vulnerable during these pathogenic processes, and such degeneration affect its normal function of absorbing the pressure and maintaining the flexibility of the spine. The etiology is rather complex and multifactorial, in which aging, injuries, and genetic variations are all involved. Although many factors are associated with the IDD, the exact mechanism is far from clear. Hindered by the poor understanding of its molecular mechanism, no effective non-surgical treatment has been developed to treat IDD.

The annulus fibrosus (AF) functions differently from NP as their respective constituents or extracellular matrix (ECM) components are very different. While NP is mainly composed of type II collagen and aggrecans to provide basis for forming the osmotic environment for optimal disc hydration, the AF is mostly composed of type I collagen optimized for resisting tensile load.

On the other hand, the functional roles of TNFAIP6, DPT, PXDN, CLIP, CHI3L1 and EMILIN1 in IVD are not elucidated yet. Since the network is constructed by KCore and Degree value (Additional file 6), it is obvious that centered nodes are more intercorrelated with other genes, which may take an important functional role in the degeneration phenotype. Among which, CHST3, COL1A2, TIMP1, COMP, CCDC80 and ABI3BP are most centered proteins in the degenerated network. CHST3, TIMP1 and COL1A2 are known genes correlated with IDD, while the correlation of COMP, CCDC80 and ABI3BP with IDD are not elucidated yet. Aside from proteins, ASPN, ITGBL1 and IFIT3 are of the few key mRNAs that are correlated with IDD in previous reports. While many other key mRNAs are not reported to be related with IDD. By further analyzing the network, we can find ossification related genes, IBSP, SOX4, RSPO3 and OGN are also included in the network.

Post-transcriptional regulation refers to the regulation of efficiency of mRNA translation to protein products by various factors. For example, microRNAs (miRNAs) are well-known post-transcriptional regulators of mRNA translation, and functions in many biological events. Conditional knockout of miRNA processing enzyme Dicer1 would cause translational defects of mRNAs and causes critical effect on cellular or mammalian survival. Another typical model is natural antisense transcript, which is generated from the opposite DNA strand to other transcriptional genes. These antisense transcripts are usually non-coding transcript that related to the antisense strand of a protein-coding gene, and could regulate that protein-coding gene expression at both transcriptional or post-transcriptional level through simple mRNA pairing of antisense transcripts to their sense strands to induce degradation. Alternatively, antisense transcripts may cause blocking effect on translational process of the sense-strand mRNAs without causing degradation of the latter. Thus, a transcriptomic and proteomic combined approach is needed to decipher the IDD mechanism in case of biased results that generated by either transcriptomic or proteomic approach along.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28796, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In order to testify this hypothesis, we those high through-put profiling data to gain insight into the regulatory network of intervertebral disc degeneration.

This means that all the included genes could affect each other and take a role in the pathogenesis of IDD in an uncovered mechanism. During which, we can find genes such as COL6A2, COL11A2, KRT19, COL1A2, TIMP1, and ITGBL1 are known extracellular matrix related factors in the regulation of IDD. Since the most eminent change of disc degeneration takes part in the extracellular matrix region of nucleus pulposus, these genes could act as \u2018effectors\u2019 or downstream components resulted from the activation of NP degeneration cascades during degeneration. Consequently, the upstream regulators of these \u2018effectors\u2019 could be more important to the process of degeneration.

First of all, the samples were collected from surgical patients, which would inevitably cause damage to the nucleus pulposus tissue, which would have effects on the gene expression of the NP cells (especially using trauma samples). So, the tissue samples, especially the normal NP samples, would have some differences to its physiological state. Moreover, the sample size for proteome study is rather small (only 3 control and 3 degenerated samples were used), which needs further validation for each candidate gene we reported in this study. Secondly, our study mainly focused on deciphering the interaction network of coding genes using RNA sequencing and protein sequencing data from NP cells, and due to the limitation of the techniques we used, some type of the proteins (like proteoglycans) and other functional RNAs like microRNAs and lncRNA (long non-coding RNAs) were not or could not be considered in this study. However, since the coding genes were of strong function in disease pathogenesis, we think that our data would throw light on further in depth studies based on our findings. Thirdly, due to the nature of the NP tissue, it is hard to collect large number of NP cells using one patient\u2019s sample, so the limited cell number may hinder the discovery of low abundance proteins expressed in it. And also, due to the limited understanding of NP cell degeneration, other issues like selecting normalization genes would be difficult than normal.
