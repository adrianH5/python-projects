Amplifications in 3q, 5p, 7p, 8q, 11q, and 20q and deletions in 3p, 8p, 9p, and 18q have been observed in most OSCC studies. In general, these CNAs can either result in altered gene dosage or disrupt intragenetic regions. Although previous studies have shown that CNAs can predict prognosis in solid malignancies, the clinical significance of CNAs in OSCC remains unclear and requires thorough investigation in large clinical cohorts.

Crucially, the ultra-deep coverage allows the highly sensitive detection of DNA sequence changes, even in small subclones. Most of the genes included in commercially available UDT-Seq panels are clinically actionable genes that are frequently mutated in numerous cancer types. Moreover, such genetic changes are clinically actionable by currently available drugs or new molecules under clinical development. This would ultimately facilitate the clinical translation of genetic data from bench to bedside. The sooner genetic alterations are identified, the sooner patients can be transferred into a clinical setting for treatment selection. Because of the low cost and high sensitivity of UDT-Seq, this therapeutically targetable cancer gene panel is increasingly being used in clinical laboratories for treatment selection. Certain clinically actionable genes contain single nucleotide variants (SNVs), whereas others contain CNAs (e.g., EGFR and BRAF). However, beyond use in identifying SNVs, the potential usefulness of UDT-Seq for detecting CNA remains unclear. How to reliably detect CNAs by using UDT-Seq data remains open to discussion. In this study, we prioritized identifying CNAs in the actionable genes targeted by UDT-Seq. The purpose of this study was to expand the use of UDT-Seq from SNV detection to CNV discovery, and examine the feasibility of UDT-Seq for molecular prognostication and identification of potential therapeutic targets in OSCC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4946, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Currently, computational methods of CNA analysis have been developed for whole exome sequencing (WES). However, various methods require paired control samples and are applicable with small sample sizes only. Thus, these established methods cannot be applied to large samples (like vast collections of tumor specimens), especially in the absence of paired controls. In addition, when control sample size is much smaller than tumor sample size, the PCA/SVD normalization algorithms tend to falsely exclude copy number variations between tumor and normal samples; instead, such methodology captures the internal variation structure of copy number data among the predominant tumor group. PCA projections are influenced by uneven sample group size. Because the UDT-Seq-targeted regions covered in this study are much sparser and smaller than those covered by WES, the small number of targeted regions is insufficient to reliably estimate parameters in hidden Markov model-based inference. Other currently available CNA tools display optimal performances only for the detection of rare CNA (i.e., those with a frequency of <1% in the patient population). The recently published ONCOCNV considers normalization with multiple factors.

Because genetic variants may explain the variable clinical trajectories of OSCC patients who share similar traditional risk factors, molecular stratification and targeted therapies are urgently needed. In this article, we extend the conventional utility of UDT-Seq in SNV detection and demonstrate that high-depth UDT-Seq is also clinically useful for identifying CNA.

All of the examined regions were classified into one of three categories: amplification, deletion, or normal. Most of the targeted regions were found to exhibit CNA in the OSCC samples. However, approximately 50% of the identified CNAs were present in less than 20% of the samples. Specifically, among the 46 targeted genes, 26 genes exhibited CNA with a frequency exceeding 20%. Figures 1 and 2 depict the frequency of copy number amplifications and deletions, respectively. The figures are sorted according to the total number of samples classified as harboring CNAs in the targeted genes. Common amplifications shared by at least 30% of the patients were identified in only 13 genes. Similarly, common deletions occurring in at least 30% of the patients were observed in only 12 genes. According to the number of SNVs reported by the Torrent Variant Caller, we noticed that OSCC samples were characterized by more CNAs than SNVs (Supplementary Table S5). Furthermore, the samples characterized by a higher number of CNAs tended to have a lower number of nonsynonymous SNVs (Figure 3). For each sample, we calculated the SNV occurrence rate as the fraction of the targeted genes harboring SNVs in a particular sample. The CNA occurrence rate was also calculated for an individual sample as the fraction of the targeted genes exhibiting copy number changes. The highest CNA occurrence rate was observed in samples with a SNV occurrence rate of less than 0.06. By contrast, samples with a SNV occurrence rate exceeding 0.1 generally exhibited a CNA rate of less than 0.3. Only 6% of all mutational events were characterized by the presence of CNA and SNV in the same gene. All of the remaining mutations were either isolated CNA or SNV.

When one breakpoint falls into a coding region, the whole CNA segment would encompass some entire genes and one incomplete gene region. Therefore, a CNA event occurring only in a part of a gene may be observed in this study because of the highly discrete nature of amplicon sequencing in UDT-Seq. Considering this, we therefore assessed the consistency of CNA calls between amplicons within a gene using a consistency score. Such score reflects the fraction of copy number-altered amplicons harboring the same amplification/deletion status of the neighboring amplicons within the same gene.

independent predictors of outcomes even after allowance for traditional risk factors in multivariate models, we used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to further validate our predicted copy number status. There were a total of 140 remaining DNA samples available for qPCR analyses, although their quantity was limited. Therefore, we selected prognostically important genes, PIK3CA and FGFR1, to be validated using qPCR because the CNAs in both genes were independently associated with multiple prognostic outcomes in the multivariate model. The experimental validation showed a mean accuracy of 85%. Accuracy was defined as the fraction of samples whose copy number (CN) status were replicated in the qPCR results. Similar to PIK3CA amplification, PTEN deletion may constitutively activate the PI3K signaling cascade. PTEN deletions were common in our study and its prognostic impact was successfully replicated in the independent cohort. We thus decided to confirm the CN status of PTEN using qPCR. The result revealed that 80% of its CN status were validated. Common SNVs in TP53 have been previously associated with OSCC. The clinical significance of SNVs in TP53 is already well known. However, TP53 deletions were also observed in the current study. Thus, we further validated TP53 deletion. The results of validation experiments indicated a mean accuracy of 87%. By contrast, several CNA associations involving amplifications in EGFR, RET, and ABL1 and deletion in BRAF were not significant after FDR correction but were still detected in the independent cohort. To confirm these CNA events, the validation of CNA in EGFR, RET, and BRAF by qPCR indicated a mean accuracy of 84%. As for ABL1, the accuracy was 70%. It should be emphasized that not all true CNAs could be detected using qPCR method. The sensitivity of qPCR decreases in presence of low-copy number variations. Thus, the accuracy results may be only conservative estimates.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23716, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To further investigate whether the knowledge of CNA could provide additional predictive power when combined with clinical risk factors, we assessed the predictive power of the individual integrated models reported in Table 3 and their corresponding clinical-factors-only models. For each prognostic outcome, the corresponding clinical-factors-only model included the clinical variables independently associated with the outcome of interest. Accordingly, we estimated the predictive power using the concordance index (c-index) for each prognostic outcome separately. The c-index was calculated using the R package survcomp to measure the probability of concordance between predicted and observed responses. A c-index exceeding 0.5 implies good prediction ability, whereas a c-index equal to 0.5 indicates random findings. When the c-index is less than 0.5, the predicted response is reversed. The significance of a difference in c-index between the integrated and clinical-factors-only models was calculated as described by Haibe-Kains et al.. Consequently, a c-index increase was observed in all outcomes when the CNA markers were added to the clinical-factors-only model (Table 4).

The prognostic CNAs identified in our study were consistent with those reported previously (Supplementary Table S4), supporting the methodological validity of our genotyping approach. For example, PIK3CA amplification was observed as ranging from 9% to 66% for OSCC, and FGFR1 amplification was found in 33% of patients with OSCC. Deletions of PTEN (29%), RB1 (66%), SMAD4 (11%), and TP53 (56%) have been previously reported in independent OSCC cohorts. Accordingly, the prevalence of CNA in TP53 (28%), FGFR1 (17%), and RB1 (35%) was lower in this study as compared with previous research conducted in Western countries. In turn, deletions in PTEN (53%) and SMAD4 (60%) were more frequently observed compared with previous studies. Such discrepancies may be explained at least in part by ethnic differences in risky oral habits. Betel quid is the main risk factor for OSCC in Eastern countries, whereas cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are the main causative agents in the West. Hence, the underlying tumorigenic mechanism in OSCC in Asia might differ from that in Western countries.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28637, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Because both the CNA amplifications and deletions observed in this study contribute to carcinogenesis in numerous solid malignancies, we sought to investigate their associations with clinical outcomes in two independent cohorts of patients with OSCC. The independent prognostic associations were successfully replicated (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, we explored the distributions of those prognostic CNA predictors using molecular pathways. Some of the prognostic CNA events identified in our study (e.g., FGFR1 amplification) were found to be distributed in the proteoglycan metabolism pathway, particularly in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthetic process. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are involved in numerous tumorigenesis processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Because the enzymatic modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans can dramatically modify tumor cell behavior, our data suggest that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthetic process is a potential therapeutic target for patients with OSCC who have the CNA in this pathway. In addition, other prognostic CNAs also clustered in the PI3K\u2013AKT signaling pathways. The PI3K\u2013AKT signaling pathway comprises key survival factors involved in the control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis and is hyperactivated in several malignancies. Among the aberrant genes in this pathway, PIK3CA amplification retained its independent prognostic significance for multiple clinical outcomes in the multivariate analysis. PIK3CA amplification constitutively activates PI3K, thereby triggering continuous activation of downstream signaling (e.g., mTOR pathway). Interestingly, PIK3CA amplification has been shown to be correlated with metastatic OSCC. Other CNA events in the PI3K\u2013AKT signaling pathway, such as loss of the PTEN suppressor, could exert the same effect as PIK3CA amplification. Furthermore, we also observed prognostic CNAs accumulated in the FOXO signaling cascade, which is downstream to the PI3K\u2013AKT pathway. The FOXO family of transcription factors are master regulators of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Notably, phosphorylation of FOXO by AKT inhibits their transcriptional functions, causing cell survival and proliferation. Hence, in the absence of PTEN-induced downregulation of AKT, FOXO transcription factors are constitutively phosphorylated, thereby inhibiting the activation of the programmed cell death pathway. However, copy number deletions in PTEN were common (52%) in the current study. FOXO signaling may be constitutively blocked in patients with OSCC who have PTEN deletion. In light of these findings, the repression of the PI3K\u2013AKT pathway (e.g., by PI3K inhibitors) and induction of FOXO transcription factors (e.g., by AKT inhibitors that suppress FOXO phosphorylation) may be considered as attractive therapeutic targets for patients with OSCC who have the CNAs in those pathways. Indeed, inhibitors of the PI3K\u2013AKT pathway are currently in various stages of development in clinical trials.

Nonetheless, using UDT-Seq to determine CNA may facilitate the molecular classification of OSCC into prognostically relevant subtypes and provide new insights into different oncogenic pathways. Although UDT-Seq could miss large CNA events, it can be clinically useful for the rapid identification of CNA patterns in OSCC.

First, identifying the main disturbed pathways (i.e., the proteoglycan metabolism, FOXO and PI3K\u2013AKT signaling) can aid in identifying novel therapeutic strategies.
