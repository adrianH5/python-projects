Advances in the treatment of CHDs have improved the survival rate of CHD patients and have largely led to an increase in its prevalence in older children and adults, who remain at high risk for continued disease burden after surgical repair, with the possibility of atrial arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and other complications requiring repeat surgery, subsequently increasing the health expenditure and medical burden on society. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to unravel the pathogenesis of CHDs.

Its potential impact on many forms of CHDs and cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, sick sinus node syndrome, atrial septal defect, pulmonary atresia, and VSD has been reported. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in MYH6 have been found to be potentially associated with CHD, whereas no reports have focused on variants in the promoter region of the MYH6 gene causing CHD. Recent studies on gene promoter regions have shown that mutations and variations in promoter regions can alter the expression of genes, which may lead to related diseases. In view of the fact that MYH6 protein is an important subunit of myosin during cardiac development, we hypothesized that variants in the MYH6 promoter may change the expression of MYH6 and may be involved in the formation of VSD.

Recent studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in MYH6 are associated with risk of VSD. Further, there is growing evidence that variants in the gene promoter play a key role in cardiac transcriptional regulation. Based on the STRING database and a previous study, we found that the major proteins interacting with MYH6 protein are basically involved in myocardial development.

It was predicted that variant g.4716G>A may attenuate the bindings of TBX1, TBX4, TBX6, TBX15 and TBX18 to the promoter region of the MYH6 gene. In fact, these genes are differentially expressed at various stages of heart development, participating in the formation of the heart. In summary, the variants in the promoter of MYH6 gene identified in this study may modify the TFBS clusters in the promoter and interfere with the formation of transcriptional regulatory complexes with related TFs, leading to the formation of VSD.
