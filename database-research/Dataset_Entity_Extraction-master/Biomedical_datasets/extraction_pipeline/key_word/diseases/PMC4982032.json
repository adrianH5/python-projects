Whole\u2010exome sequencing generates a large number of candidate disease\u2010causing variants and typical analyses rely on deleterious variants being observed in the same gene across several unrelated affected individuals. This is less likely to occur for genetically heterogeneous diseases, making more advanced analysis methods necessary. To address this need, we present HetRank, a flexible gene\u2010ranking method that incorporates interaction network data. We first show that different genes underlying the same monogenic disease are frequently connected in protein interaction networks. This motivates the central premise of HetRank: those genes carrying potentially pathogenic variants and whose network neighbors do so in other affected individuals are strong candidates for follow\u2010up study. By simulating 1,000 exome sequencing studies (20,000 exomes in total), we model varying degrees of genetic heterogeneity and show that HetRank consistently prioritizes more disease\u2010causing genes than existing analysis methods. We also demonstrate a proof\u2010of\u2010principle application of the method to prioritize genes causing Adams\u2010Oliver syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous rare disease.

An efficient and popular strategy is \u201cintersection filtering\u201d [Robinson et\u00a0al., 2011], in which several unrelated affected individuals are whole\u2010exome sequenced and their sequence variants filtered and compared. Filtering is necessary to reduce the large number of sequence variants identified for each affected individual [Li et\u00a0al., 2012], and is achieved by discarding variants which fail to meet specific criteria based on an a priori expectation of the genetic architecture of the disease under study. Typically for rare monogenic diseases, discarded variants could include those with minor allele frequencies exceeding a specified threshold, with a predicted mild functional impact, or which have been observed in an unaffected control dataset [Bamshad et\u00a0al., 2011; Robinson et\u00a0al., 2011; Li et\u00a0al., 2012]. Subsequently, genes in which a large proportion of the affected individuals carry a post\u2010filtering variant are strong candidates for disease causality and can be validated (or rejected) by other methods [Hood et\u00a0al., 2012; Jones et\u00a0al., 2012; Lines et\u00a0al., 2012; Nakazawa et\u00a0al., 2012; Polvi et\u00a0al., 2012; Simpson et\u00a0al., 2012].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2866, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This approach can be applied to both rare inherited and sporadic disorders, and does not require prior knowledge of the disease process or a set of candidate genes. However, while the search is genome wide, intersection filtering is attractive because the number of genes in which several unrelated individuals carry post\u2010filtering variants will generally be small. Conversely, the effectiveness of the approach can be limited by missing data, non\u2010exonic causal variants, or genetic (locus) heterogeneity [Robinson et\u00a0al., 2011; Boycott et\u00a0al., 2013]. In this work, we focus in particular on genetic heterogeneity, that is, mutations occurring in different genes causing the same phenotypic outcome in different patients\u2014thus, intersection filtering would likely fail to reveal those genes [Oti and Brunner, 2007; McClellan and King, 2010].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3715, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We present here a flexible analysis approach (\u201cHetRank\u201d) that addresses the problem of genetic heterogeneity in exome sequencing studies by incorporating information from biological networks (such as protein interaction networks). Networks are ideally suited to this purpose because biological function is hypothesized to arise from systems of molecular interactions [Emmert\u2010Streib and Glazko, 2011]. Networks that systematically describe these interactions can therefore group together functionally related genes beyond existing curated biological pathways [Lehne and Schlitt, 2012]. Finally, the protein products of genes causing phenotypically similar diseases are more likely to physically interact than those from non\u2010disease genes [Goh et\u00a0al., 2007; Feldman et\u00a0al., 2008]. The use of interaction data is also intuitively reasonable at a molecular level: each partner in a molecular interaction is vulnerable to mutation and a disease phenotype may result from a mutation disrupting the interaction and thus, the cooperatively achieved function [Barabasi et\u00a0al., 2011; Vidal et\u00a0al., 2011].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4822, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We previously presented BioGranat\u2010IG [Dand et\u00a0al., 2013], a software tool that searches biological networks for candidate disease\u2010causing pathways: small sets of genes whose connectedness in the network implies a functional relationship, and which when taken together carry a post\u2010filtering sequence variant for all (or most) of the patients in an exome\u2010sequencing study. HetRank has several advantages over BioGranat\u2010IG. By incorporating network information into a gene\u2010ranking framework, HetRank retains the ability to prioritize genes that are not included in the chosen input network. It also deals explicitly with the problem caused by highly connected (hub) genes in the network, which in practice can occur frequently in BioGranat\u2010IG results because of their connectivity rather than true disease involvement. The flexible ranking framework allows incorporation of diverse sources of information for variant prioritization, and limits the risk of excluding true disease\u2010causing variants due to hard filtering thresholds. Finally, HetRank can incorporate healthy control exomes to address the overrepresentation of long and variant\u2010tolerating genes among prioritized variants, a common problem in exome sequencing studies [Fuentes Fajardo et\u00a0al., 2012; Petrovski et\u00a0al., 2013].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6127, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There exist several variant prioritization tools appropriate for the study of rare monogenic diseases that integrate various sources of evidence for causality [Li et\u00a0al., 2012; Sifrim et\u00a0al., 2012; Carter et\u00a0al., 2013; Frousios et\u00a0al., 2013; Sifrim et\u00a0al., 2013; Robinson et\u00a0al., 2014].

The final gene ranking takes into account variants found in neighboring genes in the interaction network, allowing genes which do not initially score highly in a given individual to have their score improved based on evidence for disease involvement from a neighboring gene; this preferentially improves the final ranking of disease genes because the sharing of evidence between any pair of interaction partners is more likely to occur consistently across unrelated individuals as a result of true genetic heterogeneity than due to chance.

Scores are derived from variant annotations thought to be informative regarding the likelihood of a variant causing the disease being studied. Intersection filtering would remove variants from further consideration by applying hard thresholds to these annotations; here they are used as ranking criteria. Such criteria typically include the alternative allele frequency (effectively set to zero for novel sequence variants) and variant effect (e.g., synonymous, missense, nonsense). As ranking criteria are specified by the user, functional prediction scores or quantification of disease\u2010specific knowledge may also be included. With respect to each annotation in turn, all variants in an exome are ranked, with average rank being used to resolve ties. User\u2010supplied reference tables allow ranking of ordered categorical criteria. This rank is transformed into a score by taking its reciprocal and scaling: the reciprocal rank is a decaying function which prevents overweighting of variants with little evidence for disease involvement; the scaling ensures that when there are multiple joint top\u2010ranked variants, all are assigned the maximum score of 1. To incorporate user expectations of plausible disease\u2010causing variants, a \u201cfilter\u2010equivalent\u201d value for the annotation can be supplied (the same value that would be used as a threshold for intersection filtering), and the scores are scaled so that variants ranking better than this value score\u00a0\u22650.5 (Supp. Fig. S1). A variant's final score is calculated by summing the scores it achieves across all m ranking criteria. Finally, gene scores are calculated based on the mode of inheritance assumed.

In autosomal recessive (AR) mode, gene scores are either the highest score of a homozygous variant or half the sum of the top two heterozygous variants, whichever is greater (this accounts for the possibility of compound heterozygous disease\u2010causing mutations). In neutral mode, gene scores are set to the maximum score of any variant they contain, regardless of zygosity.
