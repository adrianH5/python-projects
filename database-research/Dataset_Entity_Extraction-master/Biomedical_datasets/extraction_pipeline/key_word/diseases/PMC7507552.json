Fluid accumulation in tissues can manifest as swelling in specific parts of the body, mainly in the lower limbs, but also in the upper limbs, face, and genitals. Primary lymphedema is the term used when the lymphedema is not caused by another medical condition. Milroy disease (MD) is a congenital form of lymphedema with autosomal dominant inheritance, characterized by painless unilateral edema, often present at birth, usually affecting the dorsum of the feet and extending to the lower limb. In about 70% of cases, MD is associated with missense point mutations of the FMS\u2010like tyrosine kinase 4 gene, FLT4 (MIM 136352), which encodes the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR\u20103) (Connell et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). Recent studies have shown that variants in VEGF\u2010C (MIM 601528), the gene coding for one of the VEGFR\u20103 ligands, can lead to a MD\u2010like phenotype; five families with dominantly inherited lymphedema have been so far described to present heterozygous VEGF\u2010C variants (Balboa\u2010Beltran et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014; Fastr\u00e9 et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018; Gordon et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013b; Nadarajah et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3195, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "VEGF\u2010C, important for lymph vessel development, is synthesized as precursor protein, which undergoes proteolytic processing which increases its affinity for its receptors, VEGFR\u20102 and VEGFR\u20103, with the consequent activation of intracellular signaling involved in lymphangiogenesis (Alitalo, Tammela, & Petrova,\u00a02005; Tammela & Alitalo,\u00a02010). The metalloproteinase ADAMTS3 has been shown to directly interact with VEGF\u2010C and induce its proteolytic processing.

Immunoblot analysis revealed a strong interaction between an Fc\u2010tagged version of the N\u2010terminal domain of VEGF\u2010C (VEGF\u2010C\u2010NT/Fc) and ADAMTS3 (Figure\u00a03a, lane 1). We next speculated that the Ser65Arg mutation might influence the binding of VEGF\u2010C to ADAMTS3. To test this interaction, we mixed conditioned media from 293T cells separately transfected with CCBE1, ADAMTS3, and wild\u2010type VEGF\u2010C (VEGF\u2010C\u2010WT) or mutant VEGF\u2010C (VEGF\u2010C\u2010MUT), where CCBE1 was used in ratio of 1:16 in the final reaction volume.

Based on our previous studies [17], we reasoned that high concentrations of CCBE1 and/or ADAMTS3 could mask differences in the efficiency of VEGF\u2010C activation. Assuming that differences would become more apparent when CCBE1 and/or ADAMTS3 availability were rate\u2010limiting for VEGF\u2010C activation, we performed the assay by mixing different amounts of conditioned media from cells transformed separately with expression vectors for CCBE1, ADAMTS3, and VEGF\u2010C\u2010WT or VEGF\u2010C\u2010MUT.

The lack of increment of dye distribution upon exercise in both limbs in the proband strongly suggests that these lymphatics not only lack their normal intrinsic contractility but are also affected by structural\u2010morphological defects or even partial absence of either the unidirectional intraluminal valves and/or of the fibrous molecular links between the outer surface of the lymphatic wall and the surrounding tissue fibers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25592, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Lymphoscintigraphic evidences for the limbs of the twin brother and father show a significantly reduced foot\u2010to\u2010inguinal dye distribution after mild exercise, suggesting again that the lower limbs lymphatic trunks did not benefit of the extrinsic propulsive contribution.

Milroy\u2010like disease has been described as transferred by variant in autosomal dominant state. However, we cannot exclude that they both have a pathogenic effect. Thus, based on our clinical and experimental findings, we propose that the Ser65Arg mutation affects VEGF\u2010C processing and thus may contribute to lymphedema. The arguments in favor of the role of the Ser65arg variant are: (a) it is a rare variant; (b) in silico prediction is supportive of a pathogenic role for the variant; (c) in vitro study confirmed a role in the reduction of activity of VEGF\u2010C; (d) the variant co\u2010segregate with a subclinical phenotype in the family. Instead, the variant c.148\u20103_148\u20102delCA has been shown elsewhere to be causative of lymphedema due to exon 2 and 3 skipping with the consequent deletion of 135 of the 419 amino acids of the protein. Moreover, we can hypothesize that the overt phenotype in the proband is due to the additive inactivation of VEGF\u2010C due to the hypomorphic VEGF\u2010C missense variant in a haploinsufficiency setting. This is not new in lymphedema; in particular, the work of Ghalamkarpour et al. described that  VEGFR\u20103 lymphedema, usually associated with a dominant transmission, can be caused also by an hypomorphic homozygous VEGFR\u20103 mutation (p.Ala855Thr) that impact the functioning of the receptor to a lesser extent than a dominantly inherited VEGFR\u20103 mutation (Ghalamkarpour et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). In addition, also in VEGF\u2010C animals model, a residual activity of an hypomorphic vegfc allele has been documented by Vivien et al., which showed in zebrafish that hypomorphic vegfc allele in association with a loss of function of vegfd could still retain few lymphatic vessels on the bulbous arteriosus while this was not possible in a double mutant line (Vivien et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019). In conclusion, the present data may provide an important contribution to unveil the etiology of Milroy\u2010like lymphedema and improve the possible inheritance pathway associated to VEGF\u2010C.
