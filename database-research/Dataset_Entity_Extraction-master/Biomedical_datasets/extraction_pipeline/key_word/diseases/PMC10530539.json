The characteristics of this disorder are low serum urate levels, high renal fractional excretion of urate, and occasional severe complications such as nephrolithiasis and exercise-induced acute renal failure. In this study, we report two Spanish (Caucasian) siblings and a Pakistani boy with clinical characteristics compatible with RHUC. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis identified two homozygous variants: a novel pathogenic SLC22A12 variant, c.1523G>A; p.(S508N), in the two Caucasian siblings and a previously reported SLC2A9 variant, c.646G>A; p.(G216R), in the Pakistani boy.

RHUC patients present low serum levels of UA, high fractional excretion of UA (FE UA), and increased predisposition to exercise-induced acute renal failure, EIARF) and nephrolithiasis. Two types of RHUC are distinguished based on the mutated gene; RHUC type 1 (OMIM # 220150) is caused by inactivating mutations in the SLC22A12 gene that encodes urate transport 1 (URAT1), a member of the organic anion transporter family, while RHUC type 2 (OMIM # 612076) is the result of loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 encoding glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9, a member of the GLUT family of hexose transporters). URAT1 and GLUT9 are UA transporters involved in the reabsorption of UA in the proximal renal tubule. The URAT1 protein contains 12 predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs), a long cytoplasmic loop between TMDs 6 and 7, cytoplasmic amino and carboxy ends and localized to the apical membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial cells. SLC2A9 generates two GLUT9 isoforms by alternative pre-mRNA splicing, GLUT9L and GLUT9S, which differ only at their amino termini and contain 12 predicted transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic amino and carboxy termini. In the kidney, GLUT9L is expressed at the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and is responsible for UA reabsorption, whereas GLUT9S is localized to the apical membrane of collecting duct cells. Both the GLUT9 variants facilitate urate uptake. It has been suggested that in the proximal tubule UA is reabsorbed from the lumen by URAT1 located at the apical membrane, while GLUT9 facilitates the basolateral exit of the reabsorbed UA to the peritubular interstitium and the blood.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3036, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Loss-of-function mutations in these two transporters impair UA reabsorption resulting in reduced serum levels of UA and increased UA levels in urine. Nevertheless, it has been reported that homozygous SLC2A9 mutations cause a more severe hypouricemia than homozygous SLC22A12 mutations. This difference can be explained because the reabsorption of UA is mediated not only by URAT1 but also by other apical UA transporters like the organic anion transporters OAT4 and OAT10, whereas the UA release into to the blood is facilitated exclusively by the basolateral GLUT9L transporter. Consequently, the loss of URAT1 function causes a partial defect in UA reabsorption, while the loss of GLUT9 activity prevents UA reabsorption by all the apical transporters producing a total reabsorption defect.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3830, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To date, more than 200 cases harboring mutations in the SLC22A12 gene, and approximately 30 cases with mutations in SLC2A9, have been described worldwide.
