However, interpretation of equivocal results that include variants of uncertain significance remains a challenge. In those cases, follow-up testing and clinical correlation can help clarify the clinical relevance of the molecular findings. In this report, we describe the diagnostic odyssey of a 4-year-old girl who presented with global developmental delay and seizures, with leukodystrophy seen on MRI. Clinical evaluation, MRI, and comprehensive metabolic testing were performed, followed by whole-exome sequencing (WES), parental testing, follow-up testing, and retrospective detailed clinical evaluation. WES identified two candidate causative pathogenic variants in SAMHD1, a gene associated with the recessive condition Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) type 5 (OMIM 612952): a previously reported pathogenic variant NM_015474 c.602T>A (p.I201N), maternally inherited, and a rare missense variant of uncertain significance, c.1293A>T(p.L431F). Analysis of type I interferon-related biomarkers demonstrated that the patient has an interferon signature characteristic of AGS. Retrospective detailed clinical evaluation showed that the girl has a phenotype consistent with AGS5, a rare neurological condition. These results further define the phenotypic spectrum associated with specific SAMHD1 variants, including heterozygous variants in AGS carriers, and support the idea that autoinflammatory dysregulation is part of the disease pathophysiology.

Genetic encephalopathies, depending on the causative pathogenic variants, may have a characteristic age of onset, a set of described features, and rate of progression of symptoms. A genetic diagnosis can lead to more personalized management and facilitates risk assessment in family members. Although it is therefore important to pinpoint the molecular etiology, deciding which gene or set of genes to test can be difficult when based solely on clinical features, because of overlap of features and broad phenotypic variability in affected individuals. Accordingly, clinicians are increasingly turning to comprehensive genetic testing modalities such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) to complement existing diagnostic tools, including physical exams, radiologic imaging, biochemical testing, electromyography/nerve conduction study, and tissue biopsies. WES is particularly useful for cases in which monogenic conditions are suspected but lack of specific clinical clues forestall well-defined differential diagnoses. WES has provided a molecular diagnosis in challenging cases, especially in neurometabolic disorders with nonspecific presentation. However, one of the major challenges posed by large-scale genomic sequencing modalities such as WES is simply the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) identified. VUS pose a challenge to the clinician in the sense that they raise doubts as to whether the diagnosis is likely, and whether these variants should be used for targeted testing in the future by family members to inform genetic risk assessment including prenatal diagnosis.

Mapping (hg19), alignment, and variant calling were done according to the Broad Institute's best practices using BWA and GATK. Variants were computationally annotated and filtered using an in-house bioinformatics pipeline based upon genomic position, minor allele frequency (MAF) within the 1000 Genomes database and the Exome Aggregation Consortium database (n = 61,486 exomes), and predicted effect on the resulting protein. Variants were confirmed by bidirectional Sanger dideoxy sequencing in the UNC Hospitals CLIA-certified McLendon laboratory.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21271, "infons": {"file": "MCS002758HASTB2.xml", "id": "MCS002758HASTB2", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "Sequencing coverage metrics", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21299, "infons": {"file": "MCS002758HASTB2.xml", "id": "MCS002758HASTB2", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table", "xml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><colgroup span=\"1\"><col align=\"left\" span=\"1\"/><col align=\"left\" span=\"1\"/><col align=\"char\" char=\".\" span=\"1\"/><col align=\"char\" char=\".\" span=\"1\"/><col align=\"char\" char=\".\" span=\"1\"/><col align=\"char\" char=\".\" span=\"1\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mean coverage (sample)</th><th align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">83.6\u00d7</th><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/><th rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;8\u00d7</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;15\u00d7</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;30\u00d7</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;50\u00d7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Transcript coverage (NM_015474.3)</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Transcript</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.000</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.000</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.992</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.825</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"/><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;8\u00d7</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;15\u00d7</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;30\u00d7</td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fraction &gt;50\u00d7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"17\" colspan=\"1\">Coverage (per exon;
