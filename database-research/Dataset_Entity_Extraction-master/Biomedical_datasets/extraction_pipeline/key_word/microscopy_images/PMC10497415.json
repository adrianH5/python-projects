Like dynein, Lis1 is conserved from yeast to mammals. Lis1 is a dimer, with each monomer consisting of an N-terminal small dimerization domain, an alpha helix, and a C-terminal \u03b2-propeller following a flexible linker (Fig. 1a). Lis1 is the only dynein regulator known to bind directly to dynein\u2019s AAA+ motor domain, with two known binding sites: one on dynein\u2019s motor domain between AAA3 and AAA4 (sitering), and the other on dynein\u2019s stalk, a long anti-parallel coiled coil that leads to dynein\u2019s microtubule-binding domain (sitestalk). In humans, mutations in LIS1 (PAFAH1B1; GeneID: 5048) or the dynein heavy chain gene (DYNC1H1; GeneID: 1778) cause the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly and other malformations of cortical development. Recent studies have shown that Lis1 has a role in forming active dynein complexes. Human dynein\u2013dynactin\u2013activating adapter complexes form more readily in vitro in the presence of Lis1 and move faster on microtubules owing to the recruitment of a second dynein dimer to the complex. In S. cerevisiae and the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, mutations in dynein that block the formation of the autoinhibited Phi conformation can partially rescue Lis1 deletion or mutations, suggesting that Lis1 may activate dynein by relieving autoinhibition. However, the inability of Phi-blocking mutations to fully rescue Lis1 loss-of-function phenotypes suggests that Lis1 may have additional roles in regulating dynein beyond relieving the autoinhibited Phi conformation.

Although this data set appeared to consist primarily of particles containing one dynein motor domain bound to one Lis1 dimer, we revisited it to look for other structures. To our surprise, additional data processing revealed several two-dimensional (2D) class averages that contained two dynein motor domains, even though the dynein that we used for cryo-EM sample preparation was engineered to be monomeric. Using this subset of particles, we solved a structure of two dynein motor domains in complex with two Lis1 dimers to 4.1\u2009\u00c5. We called this structure \u2018Chi\u2019 because the dynein conformation resembles the Greek letter Chi, and because Chi follows Phi in the Greek alphabet (Fig. 1c,d, Supplementary Video 1, Extended Data Fig. 1, and Table 1). In our structure, two dynein motor domains, each bound by a Lis1 dimer, come together through dynein\u2013Lis1 interactions which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously reported. This arrangement is consistent with previous studies that have reported the binding of two Lis1 dimers to dynein in solution. In our Chi structure, the closed conformation of dynein\u2019s ring and the characteristic bulge in the stalk near its contact site with the buttress indicate a weak microtubule-binding state. The overall structure of each dynein\u2013Lis1 complex is very similar to the structures that we have solved of individual dynein motor domains bound to a Lis1 dimer, also in a weak microtubule-binding state. Importantly, the Chi conformation is not a consequence of the E2488Q substitution in dynein, or the use of ATP-vanadate in the sample: we also observed Chi in a data set collected from a sample containing wild-type dynein monomer, ATP, and Lis1 (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Table 1).

For this, we turned to experiments in S. cerevisiae. In yeast, dynein functions to align the mitotic spindle, such that, upon the completion of mitosis, both the mother and daughter cell inherit a nucleus. Deletion of the gene encoding dynein (DYN1; GeneID: 853928) and dynactin subunits, as well as Lis1, causes nuclear segregation defects that are readily quantifiable because they produce binucleate cells. To disrupt the Chi-specific interactions (Fig. 4a,b), we mutated Asn213 in Lis1 to Ala (Lis1N213A), Trp288 to Asp (Lis1W288D), or both (Lis1N213A W288D) in the endogenous locus of yeast Lis1 (PAC1; GeneID: 854443). Western blots of strains containing FLAG-tagged versions of the mutants confirmed that Lis1N213A, Lis1W288D, and Lis1N213A W288D were expressed at wild-type levels (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We found that, among cells expressing any of these three mutants, the percentage of cells containing two nuclei was increased, similar to cells in which Lis1 was deleted (Fig. 4c). We obtained similar results when we disrupted Chi on dynein\u2019s side. On the basis of our structure, we introduced F3446A in AAA5 and E3867A in AAA6 (Dyn1F3446A E3867A; Fig. 4a,b). Although we did not build the side chain for E3867 in our model owing to the lower resolution of that part of the map, this residue is a good candidate for mediating the interaction between dynein and Lis1-N213. These substitutions in dynein resulted in an increase in the percentage of binucleate cells similar to that observed following deletion of dynein (Fig. 4d). This suggests that the dynein\u2013Lis1 interactions involved in forming Chi are required for Lis1\u2019s regulation of dynein in vivo.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20768, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Dynein localization in yeast depends on dynein and Lis1 Chi contacts", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20837, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Next, we wanted to determine how the Lis1\u2013dynein interactions involved in forming Chi contribute to dynein\u2019s localization in yeast cells (Fig. 4e\u2013h). Yeast dynein assembles into fully active complexes with dynactin and Num1, the presumed yeast dynein activating adapter, at the cell cortex. From this site, active dynein pulls on spindle pole body (SPB)-attached microtubules to align the mitotic spindle, which ultimately favors equal segregation of nuclei between mother and daughter cells. Dynein reaches the cortex by first localizing to microtubule plus ends, through either kinesin-dependent transport or cytosolic recruitment. Dynein also localizes to the SPB, where microtubule minus ends are found. Lis1 is required for dynein\u2019s localization to all three sites. To assess how the mutants that target the new interactions between dynein and Lis1 in Chi affect dynein localization, we introduced Lis1N213A, Lis1W288D and Lis1N213A W288D at the endogenous Lis1 (PAC1) locus. In these strains, dynein, \u03b1-tubulin, and a spindle pole body component were also tagged with a fluorescent protein (DYN1-3XGFP, TUB1-CFP, and SPC110-tdTomato, respectively) (Fig. 4e) and used to measure the number of dynein foci that were found at the cell cortex (Fig. 4f), SPBs (Fig. 4g), or microtubule plus ends (Fig. 4h) in each cell. All three mutants showed a striking reduction in the number of dynein foci at the cell cortex, similar to the strain with Lis1 deletion (Fig. 4f). Because the cortex is the site of dynein\u2013dynactin\u2013Num1 assembly, these data suggest that the Chi conformation is important for the assembly of active dynein complexes in vivo. All three mutants also significantly affected the ability of dynein to localize to microtubule plus ends. One mechanism dynein uses to reach microtubule plus ends is through kinesin transport in a complex that also contains Lis1 and Bik1/CLIP170 (refs. ). Thus, it is possible that this transport complex uses the dynein\u2013Lis1 interactions we identified in Chi, or potentially the Chi conformation itself.

In vitro, human Lis1 protein (herein, LIS1) enhances the formation of dynein\u2013dynactin\u2013activating adapter complexes containing two dynein dimers, which move faster than the single dynein dimer complexes that form in the absence of LIS1 (refs. ). To do this, we first had to identify Chi-disrupting substitutions in human LIS1 that were predicted to be equivalent to the ones we identified in yeast. Directly overlaying our recent structure of a human dynein\u2013LIS1 complex onto each motor domain of yeast Chi did not work, as LIS1 bound to sitering is too far away from the opposite dynein to form the Chi-stabilizing interactions with AAA5 and AAA6 (Fig. 5a). This difference is due to human LIS1 having shorter peripheral loops and being slightly rotated relative to yeast Lis1 (ref. ) when bound to dynein. To circumvent this problem, we modeled human Chi by aligning a copy of our structure of human dynein bound to two LIS1s to each motor domain in Chi dynein, and then manually moving the models so that they were within interacting distance while still maintaining the stalk\u2013stalk interaction observed in both Chi and Phi dynein. Using this model, we made two sets of human LIS1 substitutions: p.N203A, p.D205A, and p.Y225A to disrupt both the LIS1\u2013AAA5 and LIS1\u2013AAA6 interfaces, and p.N203A, p.D205A, and p.D245A to disrupt the LIS1\u2013AAA6 interface alone.

In these assays, activation of motility is read out by observing an increase in dynein complex velocity in the presence of LIS1, which results from the enhanced formation of dynein complexes containing two dynein dimers. As we have shown previously, pre-incubation of dynein\u2013dynactin\u2013BICD2 with 300\u2009nM wild-type human LIS1 increased the velocity and number of processive runs of these complexes (Fig. 5b\u2013d).
