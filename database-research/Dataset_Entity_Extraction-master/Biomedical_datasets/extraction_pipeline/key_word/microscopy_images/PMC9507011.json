VWF is an adhesive multidomain plasma glycoprotein (Figure 1A) that functions in hemostasis by acting as a stabilizer of coagulation factor VIII and a crosslinker of platelets and extracellular matrix components at sites of vascular injury. The ability of VWF to staunch bleeding is correlated with its ability to form long and polyvalent disulfide-linked concatemers. Short VWF concatemers are associated with the excessive bleeding of type 2A VWD. Maturation of VWF requires a remarkable intracellular biogenesis pathway that includes the formation of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds, glycosylation, and proteolytic removal of an N-terminal D1D2 prodomain (Figure 1A). Biogenesis starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where VWF dimerizes through disulfide bonds between C-terminal cysteine knot (CK) domains. Surprisingly, however, the disulfide bonds that covalently link VWF dimers into concatemers do not form in the oxidoreductase-rich ER but in the acidic environments of the trans-Golgi and Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). In these acidic environments, the C-terminal A2-CK domains in VWF zipper together to form a \u201cdimeric bouquet,\u201d and the dimers then assemble through their N-terminal portions into helical tubules. The helical tubules are proposed to template the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between adjacent D3 domains, leading to the formation of VWF concatemers. However, the mechanism by which tubules template concatemerization is incompletely understood, and there is uncertainty about which cysteine residues form the intermolecular disulfide linkages. Mass spectrometry showed that C1099 and C1142 were free in monomeric VWF D\u2032D3 but not in mature VWF. Substitution of these 2 cysteine residues with alanine prevented disulfide-mediated dimerization of the D\u2032D3 domain and concatemerization of full-length VWF. However, only C1142\u2013C1142-linked peptides were observed in tryptic digests of plasma VWF. Further casting doubt on the presence of a C1099\u2013C1099 linkage was a recent electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human MUC2, a filament-forming mucin with an N-terminal head domain that resembles VWF, which indicated that C1142 and C1097 but not C1099 are responsible for intermolecular disulfide bonds.

Although we expected to see histidine residues in key interactions in tubules, we instead found that only a small number are found in such contacts, and these are restricted to intramolecular interfaces (Figure 4B-C).
