Due to the limited ablation rates of low Ga+ ion beam currents required to maintain the structural integrity of vitreous specimens, common preparation protocols are time-consuming and labor intensive. The improved stability of new-generation cryo-FIB instruments now enables automated operations. Here, we present an open-source software tool, SerialFIB, for creating automated and customizable cryo-FIB preparation protocols. The software encompasses a graphical user interface for easy execution of routine lamellae preparations, a scripting module compatible with available Python packages, and interfaces with three-dimensional correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) tools.

Fixation through rapid cooling to cryogenic temperature (below \u2013140\u00b0C) arrests water molecules in a glass-like phase, thus preserving biological structures in a near-native state. The vitrification temperature is pressure dependent. Hence, the maximum achievable vitrification depth ranges from ~10 \u00b5m for plunge-freezing at ambient pressure to ~200 \u00b5m in high-pressure freezing (HPF). Most cellular cryo-ET imaging is performed in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 300 kV, at which the inelastic mean free path of an electron in biological material is in the order of 300\u2013400 nm. Consequently, thicker samples will exhibit a rapidly decreasing signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, most cells, excluding the thinnest peripheries of adherent eukaryotic cells, are not directly suitable for cryo-ET. Cryo-FIB micromachining enables the production of electron-transparent cellular slices thinner than 300 nm, which are termed lamellae. Cryo-FIB milling has been successfully applied to single-cell specimens deposited or grown on TEM grids, or to voluminous multicellular samples from HPF using in situ lift-out. These approaches yield specimens of suitable quality for molecular-resolution cryo-ET, circumventing artifacts described for mechanical sectioning by cryo-ultramicrotomy. However, common cryo-FIB preparations constitute a low-throughput method owing to slow ablation rates of Ga+ ions at low currents (30 pA to 1 nA) typically used to micromachine vitreous specimens. The method further requires significant user expertise with a steep learning curve, which limits its practical usability. In addition, emerging concepts such as multi-modal imaging through serial cryo-FIB ablation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) volume imaging coupled to lamella preparation are challenging to achieve with manual operations. Automation is thus essential to improving the performance, throughput, and applicability of cryo-FIB methods as has been the case for cryo-TEM imaging.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3371, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Automation for cryo-FIB , designed for the specialized task of routine on-grid lamellae preparation from single-cell specimens, has been to date based on proprietary software or command-line operation. An open-source and easy-to-use package for customized cryo-FIB-SEM workflows is currently missing. Inspired by SerialEM, we developed an automation software platform to address the current gap for cryo-FIB instruments. We demonstrate the flexibility of this software platform on several use cases ranging from standard preparations to customized applications. This includes (i) on-grid lamella preparation, (ii) cryo-fluorescence light microscopy (cryo-FLM)-based 3D-targeted lamella preparation, (iii) cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging, with an option for subsequent lamella preparation, and (iv) micromachining for in situ lift-out from voluminous HPF samples. Apart from the proprietary application programming interface (API) required for communication with the microscope, the software code is open source, opening the potential for further workflow development. We show that our milling protocols can be performed without supervision on six different specimens. Some of the specimens contain high-density intracellular structures, that is, lipid droplets or minerals, which introduce additional difficulty to the generation of homogenously thin lamellae. We therefore provide milling protocols for a broad range of cellular sample types. We demonstrate that cryo-FIB procedures such as cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging and lift-out trench milling can be user-tailored in SerialFIB.

Protocols simplify the creation of pattern sequence files by focusing on use-case-specific parameters. For example, for on-grid lamella preparation, the parameters specified are the number of milling steps, the current and milling time in each step, and the upper to lower milling pattern distance. Currently, we provide protocols for several use cases including on-grid lamella preparation, 3D cryo-FLM-guided lamella preparation, and FIB-SEM volume imaging. More customized tasks employ pattern sequence files directly, as has been implemented here for automated lift-out site preparation. Upon selection of a protocol in the SerialFIB GUI (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A), the software automatically generates the necessary pattern sequence files, which are then parsed and executed through the system-specific intermediary driver. Protocols and pattern sequence files can be edited in a text editor or through one of the dedicated \u2018Designer\u2019 modules, which provides a graphical interface and preview of parameters to enable adjustments during optimization of the workflow (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B and C).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9379, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "During a typical cryo-FIB session, points of interest on the sample and their coincidence height (the height at which the FIB and SEM beam coincide) are identified manually through the microscope\u2019s user interface.

For on-grid lamella preparation, for example, this means defining the lamella position, width, and extreme points above and below the target lamella from which ablation of material will begin (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A). To start the procedure, the corresponding protocol is initiated. This will trigger the creation and execution of pattern sequence files for each patterning step as defined in the protocol.

Then, the user can choose to create micro-expansion joints to relieve tension in the frozen specimen (Figure 2B). This is followed by removal of material in two stages: (i) rough milling, where all positions of interest are milled to ~1 \u00b5m thickness, and (ii) fine milling, where the generated slices are thinned to ~200 nm thickness at the end of the session to achieve electron transparency (Figure 2C). Amorphous ice condensation on the final lamellae due to residual water in the microscope, which reduces image contrast, can be minimized by limiting the total fine milling time for each grid.

HeLa and C. reinhardtii, respectively). Using fiducials, fluorescent microbeads for example, which are visible in fluorescence, SEM and FIB imaging, cryo-FLM data can be superposed with SEM and FIB images to localize a structure of interest for targeted lamella preparation. Currently, resolution in cryo-FLM imaging is limited due to the use of dry objectives. For the confocal laser scanning system employed in this work, which has an objective of numerical aperture 0.9, lateral resolution is limited to 215\u2013442 nm and axial resolution to 933\u20131915 nm at a pinhole size of 1 Airy unit across the visible spectrum. The previously described 3D Correlation Toolbox (3DCT) provides an interface to calculate the geometric transform between imaging modalities. To improve the precision of localization beyond the resolution limit, Gaussian fitting is performed for the determination of fiducial centers in the fluorescence modality. To further improve on the throughput and usability of this technically challenging workflow, we have introduced new features in 3DCT to assist with fiducial selection and superposition of the cryo-FLM data (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1).

Thus, correlation is often performed first with the SEM image. To aid in this process, we implemented a bead detection tool based on cross-correlation with a Gaussian kernel and Hough transform to facilitate semi-automated detection of beads in the SEM image (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A), after which corresponding beads in the cryo-FLM data can be selected in the 3DCT interface for calculation of a coordinate transform. For fast validation of the calculated transform, maximum intensity projections of the 3D cryo-FLM data can now be generated within 3DCT and overlaid onto the SEM image (Figure 3A). Once the positions of fiducials have been established, their corresponding positions in the FIB image need to be determined. The matching of fiducials between SEM and FIB images was previously performed manually. The new \u2018Fiducial Rotation\u2019 feature in 3DCT (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B) takes advantage of the fact that at coincidence height SEM and FIB images are related by the angle between the two beams and beam shifts. By rotating and translating fiducial coordinates with respect to a user-defined reference point in both images (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B), for example, surface ice contaminants or similarly recognizable feature, the positions of fiducials in the FIB image are determined. These positions can be adjusted subsequently within the 3DCT GUI in an iterative manner to minimize registration residuals and a final transform calculated. For automated milling, the correlated FIB image is loaded into SerialFIB to serve as the reference image with marked target position of structures of interest. Maximum intensity projections can be generated and overlaid onto the displayed FIB image to help define milling positions (Figure 3B). Additionally, transformed coordinates of points of interest calculated in 3DCT can be imported directly into the SerialFIB GUI (Figure 3C). Automated milling as described above can then be executed to generate lamellae that retain the structure of interest (Figure 3D).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28906, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, a new 3DCT feature offers the possibility to overlay the cryo-FLM data with the SEM images of the generated lamella for subsequent navigation during cryo-ET data acquisition (Figure 3E\u2013G). A 3D mask describing the thickness, orientation, and boundary of the lamella can be created and applied to the original fluorescence volume before projection onto the SEM image (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C). We term the resulting masked fluorescence volume a FLM \u2018virtual slice\u2019, which provides a way to visualize signal contained within the lamella (Figure 3E). For guiding cryo-ET data acquisition, we make use of the 2D affine image registration feature of SerialEM to relate between the SEM/fluorescence overlay and TEM montage of the lamella (Figure 3F).

Targeted lipid droplets measured less than 500 nm in diameter, which is comparable to the resolution of the cryo-FLM system used, and thus make a good case study for evaluating this workflow. Cells were plunge-frozen on two different substrates: titanium grids with holey 1/20 SiO2 support (1 \u03bcm holes positioned 20 \u03bcm apart), and the more widely used gold grids with holey 1/4 SiO2 support. By comparing between the final TEM image and FLM virtual slice based on correlations with the pre-milling FIB image, we found that the targeted lipid droplet was retained in 7 out of 10 lamellae on titanium SiO2 1/20 across three grids processed in separate sessions. In contrast, the targeted lipid droplet was retained in zero out of four lamellae on gold SiO2 1/4 from one grid (Supplementary file 2, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). However, upon comparison between the final TEM image and FLM virtual slice based on FIB images acquired after milling, none of the target positions coincided with the lamella any more (Supplementary file 2). To investigate this mismatch, we generated virtual slices corresponding to different sample heights in the FIB image and projected these slices onto the TEM image. By assessing qualitatively how well bead and lipid droplet fluorescence in the different virtual slices corresponded to features on the TEM image, we determined which sample height in the FIB image generated the best-fitting virtual slice (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2G\u2013I). We found that the best-fitting slice was within 3 pixels in the FIB y-direction (corresponding to 253\u2013506 nm) of the correlated target position post-milling for 9 out of 10 lamellae on titanium SiO2 1/20, and more than 10 pixels away (>670 nm) for all lamellae on gold SiO2 1/4 (Supplementary file 2, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). These results hint at the possibility of local deformations within the sample occurring during FIB milling, which can impinge on the success rate of 3D-CLEM-guided workflows beyond inaccuracies in milling and correlation. Indeed, elastic 2D B-spline registration of FIB images before and after milling revealed a nonuniform displacement in the support of the grid squares (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3). This displacement occurred irrespective of whether rough and fine milling were carried out separately or in one continuous sequence per position. In all cases, regardless of support type, the displacements seemed more pronounced in areas of thin ice and along the y-direction of the FIB image (up to 2.5 \u03bcm). Despite this, it was still possible to retain the target lipid droplet during milling in 70% of the tested cases on titanium support. Taken together, our observations suggest that mechanical stability of the specimen should be considered when performing 3D-CLEM-guided milling for retaining structures of interest in the final lamella. It appears that the combination of a rigid titanium grid, a more continuous support (1/20), and similar thermal expansion behavior between grid and support can help to mitigate local deformations around the milling site. However, a more systematic evaluation would be needed to confirm these observations. In cases of mechanical deformations that compromise correlation accuracy, intracellular fiducials, for example, by lipid droplet staining, can be leveraged to provide local reference points for refinement of the correlation post-milling across modalities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33380, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33408, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Serial cryo-FIB sectioning and SEM imaging produce a nanometer-scale 3D representation of the specimen, providing valuable cellular context on organelle size and distribution and an opportunity to fine-tune the positioning of lamella preparation. Once a feature of interest is identifiable in the SEM images, volume imaging can be stopped to allow subsequent lamella generation. With SerialFIB, we provide an automated cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging workflow. We tested this workflow on Sum159 breast cancer cells. First, an opening into the cell is created by FIB ablation at the cell\u2019s uppermost edge. Then, a volume to be imaged is chosen, within which cellular material is alternatingly ablated in defined steps and the newly exposed surface is imaged by the SEM (Figure 4A\u2013E, Figure 4\u2014video 1). SEM imaging conditions are optimized to visualize cellular structures, while keeping acquisition times as short as possible (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A, see Materials and methods).

The root-mean-square residual of the fitted transform was 386 nm, with outliers occurring in clusters, indicating potential local elastic image deformations (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). In the present dataset, the alignment of SEM slices was also heavily dominated by surface structures outside of the sliced volume. These features presumably lie on a different incline relative to the imaged slices and thus contribute to the shear in y along z. Furthermore, stretching of the cryo-FLM volume in z was necessary, reminiscent of axial distortion correction factors that are applied in light microscopy to account for compression when the refractive index of the immersion medium (air) is lower than that of the specimen (ice). In line with a recent study on lipid droplet-based registration between cryo-FLM and cryo-FIB-SEM volumes, stretching of the cryo-FLM volume may also have been required due to stage drift in our cryo-FIB system.

The prepared site can subsequently be approached by a cryo-gripper mounted on a micromanipulator, secured between the gripper arms, detached from the bulk by FIB milling and transferred to a specialized carrier grid, termed half-moon grid (Figure 5E). Unlike previous studies where the half-moon grid was fashioned into slots prior to lamella deposition, here we attached the chunks directly to the grid pins. Lamellae attachment was performed by re-deposition of the grid material onto the lamella while held in place by the gripper, similar to procedures described for tungsten needles. Subsequently, the gripper was moved to a safe position and organometallic platinum was deposited to secure the lamella to the grid pin (Figure 5E). Finally, the lamellae were fine-milled manually at a pre-tilt of 10\u00b0 with respect to the grid plane (Figure 5F and G inset), and the grid transferred to the TEM for cryo-ET data acquisition (Figure 5G).

While communication with the microscope is based on a proprietary API provided by the microscope manufacturer, functions required for automation, including alignment tasks or transformation of FLM data, are decoupled from the commercial scripting interface.

The density and distribution of cells on TEM grids is a crucial factor that determines vitrification quality and milling success. To this end, the concentration of cell in suspensions and the applied volume need to be optimized for each sample type. For adherent cells, the use of micropatterning to direct their seeding helps to improve their positioning on grids for lamella preparation.

Two recent hardware solutions have been developed to reduce manual handling of cryo-grids: integration of a fluorescence microscope into the FIB-SEM chamber or the use of shuttles that can be loaded both in the cryo-FLM and cryo-FIB-SEM microscope. Tension buildup in the grid support during freezing likely arises due to differences in thermal expansion coefficients between the metal mesh and the support film, or from tension in the ice film itself. In our experiments, titanium grids with almost continuous SiO2 support appeared to perform better in 3D-targeted lamellae preparations than gold SiO2 grids. Nevertheless, local deformations were evident during FIB imaging and milling regardless of grid type in areas of thin ice. Thus, grids with stable supports should be considered for cellular preparations and ice thickness should be optimized in the vicinity of the milling area. Furthermore, we show that native cellular structures such as lipid droplets that can be stained with live dyes provide a means to identify and validate the 3D positioning of cryo-FLM data corresponding to the produced lamella.

Thus, an isotropic distribution of fiducials around the target point is important to minimize the registration error. The fluorescence signal intensity of fiducials and features of interest are also of importance as they determine how confidently the objects can be localized, which also contributes to the registration error. In this respect, 1-\u03bcm-sized fluorescent beads are a good choice of fiducials for 3D-CLEM-guided workflows as they are sufficiently large to detect by FIB and SEM imaging and sufficiently bright in cryo-FLM when embedded in ice.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 53264, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Current solutions for diffraction-limited cryo-FLM employ non-immersion (dry) objectives.

For single-cell specimens, where the cellular volume does not exceed 10 \u03bcm in thickness, our cryo-FIB-SEM-based analysis of microbeads and lipid droplets in HeLa cells suggests that affine transforms are sufficient for overcoming potential imaging aberrations and achieving reasonable correlation accuracies for 3D-CLEM-guided milling.

The increasing cooling runtimes of cryo-FIB-SEM microscopes paired with customized automation will enable shifting time-consuming steps of cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging to overnight operation. While conventional on-grid milling already benefits from the higher throughput made possible by overnight runs and lower in-chamber contamination, the impact on successfully targeted cryo-FIB lift-out is expected to be also significant. Currently, cryo-FLM-guided site-specific preparation for in situ lift-out relies on manual identification of global features from cryo-FLM data at the surface of the sample for rough registration. Microbead fiducials, if introduced before cryo-fixation, would be buried within the bulk specimen and therefore preclude precise 3D registration. Cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging prior to cryo-FIB lift-out should allow identification of fiducials in the bulk specimen, whether they be fluorescent microbeads or biological landmarks, and subsequent precise registration with the 3D cryo-FLM data. This opens the possibility of using fluorescence signal in combination with cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging to refine targeting for lift-out approaches once on-the-fly postprocessing and automated segmentation of the cryo-FIB-SEM volume data become available. In this case, automated overnight operation can increase both throughput and success rate, while the experimenter can focus solely on error-prone steps such as the lift-out procedure or fine milling of the extracted lamellae.

Wohlwend) using Schneider\u2019s medium containing 20% Ficoll (70 kDa) as filling medium. HPF carriers were soaked in hexadecene and blotted on filter paper prior to freezing. Cryo-planing of approximately 40 \u00b5m of the surface was performed in a cryo-microtome (EM UC6/FC6 cryo-microtome, Leica Microsystems) using a 45\u00b0 diamond trimming knife with a clearance angle of 6\u00b0 (DiAtome). The sample was glued to a custom 3D-printed shuttle after the Leica design using cryo-glue (2:3 ethanol:isopropanol mixture) for cryo-confocal imaging with a Leica TCS SP8 equipped with Leica EM cryo-CLEM stage. Imaging was performed using a HC PL APO \u00d750/0.9 DRY objective in fluorescence mode using a 552 nm excitation laser at 17% total laser strength and 488 nm excitation at 6.8% total laser strength, corresponding to roughly 0.94 mW and 0.38 mW, respectively (based on measured laser intensity values).

Standard 45\u00b0 pre-tilt shuttles were used for accommodating both HPF carrier and Auto-Grid clipped receiver grid on an Aquilos stage that was modified by removing ~2 mm of material of the stage using a file to allow the cryo-gripper to reach the sample surface. OmniProbe 4-post Cu half-grids were used as receiver grids (Plano EM). After specimen loading, platinum GIS deposition was performed for 10 s at 27\u00b0C with the GIS needle distance at a stage working distance of 10.6 mm. Samples were sputter coated with platinum in the chamber (10 mA, 15 s). For all trench milling steps and SerialFIB session setup, drift suppression using the SEM was applied to compensate positive charges brought in by FIB milling. The stage was rotated by 180\u00b0 relative to loading position and tilted to 7\u00b0 to orient the sample surface perpendicular to the FIB. Trench milling was performed with \u2018regular cross-section patterns\u2019 at 30 kV, 1 nA creating a C-shape using SerialFIB (Figure 5). The milling included two patterns of 40 \u00b5m \u00d7 15 \u00b5m symmetrically arranged around a 20 \u00b5m block. Together with a third pattern, 10 \u00b5m \u00d7 40 \u00b5m was generated at an offset of 15 \u00b5m to the left and perpendicular to the previous two, yielding a 20 \u00b5m \u00d7 20 \u00b5m block for lift-out. Milling time per position was 30 min. In total, five positions were prepared, resulting in a milling preparation time of 2.5 hr. Undercuts were performed manually by tilting the stage to 43\u00b0 and employing \u2018cleaning cross-section\u2019 patterns of 1 \u00b5m height, 22 \u00b5m width, and 15 \u00b5m depth at ~7 \u00b5m distance from the sample surface. Lift-out was performed with the microgripper oriented parallel to the FIB angle and perpendicular to the sample surface. The produced sample chunks were approached by the gripper. After contact of both tweezer arms with the sample, the chunk was milled loose from the bulk material with \u2018regular cross-section patterns\u2019 at 1 nA with a pattern of 20 \u00b5m in length, 1 \u00b5m in width until extraction from the bulk was possible. Subsequently, the microgripper was raised until it was ~400 \u00b5m above the sample surface. The stage was moved down by ~15 mm into safe distance from the gripper and subsequently moved to the receiver grid position while keeping the Z-height locked. Then, the stage was lifted to the appropriate Z-height of the receiver grid. The microgripper was moved to the post of the TEM half-grid until achieving contact of the sample. \u2018Regular cross-section\u2019 patterns at height of 2 \u00b5m and width of 6 \u00b5m were used to attach the sample to the post by re-deposition of the post material onto the sample. Subsequently, the gripper was opened, releasing the chunk that has been welded to the pin, and moved to a safe position. This is achieved by lifting the gripper until it is 400 \u00b5m above the sample surface and then moving the stage down by 15 mm, making enough room to safely move it to the park position. This procedure can be performed for all four pins. Finally, deposition of platinum GIS for 3 \u00d7 30 s in 3 min intervals at a stage working distance of 9 mm was used to strengthen the sample attachment to the pin. Lamella production was done manually with sequentially reduced FIB currents of 3 nA to 5 \u00b5m lamella thickness, 1 nA to 4 \u00b5m, 0.5 nA to 3 \u00b5m, 0.3 nA to 2 \u00b5m, and 0.1 nA to 1 \u00b5m using \u2018regular cross-sections\u2019 patterns. Subsequent fine milling was performed using \u2018regular patterns\u2019 at 0.1 nA to 600 nm and 50 pA to 200 nm. The FIB divergence was compensated by over- and under-tilts of 1\u00b0.

However, the size of the object to locate (when it is not diffraction-limited) will play a role in how frequently the targeting is successful: this issue should at least be discussed.

SerialFIB is comprised of a graphical user interface, a scripting module, and a driver that interprets user-defined actions for the microscope. The driver works with the TFS dual beam instruments. Based on the desired milling protocol, a user can work with either the GUI or the scripting module. The authors provide substantial evidence on how this tool can be programmed to carry out a wide range of existing sample preparation techniques including: lamella preparation on single cells, fluorescence guided lamella targeting, trench milling for cryo-lift out procedures, and cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging. All the workflows are fully benchmarked from sample preparation all the way to sub-tomogram averaging. The authors have also tested these workflows on multiple different cell types and provided their recipes for the thinning of each specific cell type. The data provided supports the claim that serialFIB makes the execution of these techniques more streamlined and flexible. As an example, the authors take advantage of the streamlined CLEM lamella preparation and study the deformation of the grid support because of exposure to the ion beam and quantify the resulting offsets in the positioning of the lamella. The authors then provide a workflow that will help with the correct registration of FLM volume data with the tomograms of the offset lamella acquired with TEM. This finding alone is of great interest to the researches in the field. In another benchmarking effort, the authors characterize lamella preparation directly following cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging. They provide a recipe where volume imaging can be used to identify sub-cellular organelles after which a lamella is prepared and imaged in TEM.

Descriptions of registration errors have been formalised and extended by many in the field of medical imaging, with particular focus on image-guidance systems for surgery (2). Like in surgery, the likelihood of successful targeting by FLM-guided FIB milling will depend on the target registration error, defined as the deviation of a target point in the registered image from its true position (2, 3). This error depends on the target position, the placement of fiducials and the error with which fiducials are localized (more below). Fiducials need to be big enough to spot in FIB and SEM images when embedded in ice, whereas they also need to be bright enough for accurate Gaussian-based fitting of their centres in the fluorescence modality. We have thus chosen micron-sized beads for the correlative workflow. As for the size of the target object, we expect this to affect targeting in at least two ways: (i) when the size is below or close to the registration error, the likelihood of success in targeting will drop; (ii) if the fluorescence signal is weak because the target object is small or contains few fluorophores, there will be a greater error in the localisation of the target itself. We now elaborate on these concepts in the Discussion (Line 621\u2013639). Finally, the size of most lipid droplets targeted in this study does not exceed the theoretical resolution limit of the cryo-FLM system used (up to 442 nm laterally and 1.9 \u03bcm axially, now stated in Line 267\u2013269, and similar to the values previously reported in (3)).

Axial resolution in cryo-FLM is commonly worse than lateral resolution (3), and these values are now provided in the revised manuscript.

We have not implemented such corrections in the current workflow. Thus, fiducial localisation error due to poor axial resolution and depth-induced aberrations can be expected.

TEM imaging of sparse biological phenomena in cells requires guided lamella preparation with the help of fluorescence tags. The authors show that despite the guided lamella preparation, the final lamella can be offset to the extent that it does not encompass the region of interest anymore. This is traced back to the deformations in the support film that can happen at the area exposed to the ion beam and even in the surrounding areas. Using two different grid types that differ in the continuity of the support film and the element of the grid bars, the authors demonstrate substantial variability in the extent of sample deformation. This is an important lesson for the researchers in the field and it provides a workflow to characterize such deformations for different grid types.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 143990, "infons": {"section_type": "REVIEW_INFO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although volume imaging of chemically fixed specimen is well characterized, cryo-FIB-SEM volume imaging remains challenging both in implementation and in minimizing radiation damage.

This paper and the presented open-source software suite will without doubt contribute to popularising and easing different cryo-FIB SEM applications. Particularly the flexible protocols with tested, recipe-like default parameters will be helpful. Despite these advances, it should be noted that some of the procedures addressed here, in particular cryo-CLEM and cryo-lift-out from high-pressure frozen tissue samples, remain difficult non-routine applications that will still require expert know-how and empirical developments of protocols.
