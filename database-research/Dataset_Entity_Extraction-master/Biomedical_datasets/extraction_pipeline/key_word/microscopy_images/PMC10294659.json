K. pneumoniae belongs to the ESKAPE group of pathogens, a group that commonly gives rise to severe infections that are often life-threatening.

In 2019, 2.5 million deaths were attributed to this disease. It can be especially devastating for young children with still developing immune systems, as almost a third of these victims were under 5 years old. In fact, pneumonia was the cause of 16% of all deaths of children in this age range. The Gram-negative pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic bacterium that is able to initiate different types of health care-associated infections, including pneumonia, septicemia, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Unfortunately, K. pneumoniae has developed antimicrobial resistance and has become an immediate threat to our global health. A recent study of K. pneumoniae isolates from intensive care units in the northern region of Brazil indicated that most of these isolates have a high level of resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, quinolones, tigecycline, and the last resort drug colistin. If current trends continue, infections caused by K. pneumoniae may become untreatable within the next decade. The continued COVID-19 pandemic has severely challenged our global health care worldwide. This is exacerbated when combined with the growing problem of bacterial antimicrobial resistance. It appears that K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii are the most prevalent causative agents for secondary bacterial infection in COVID-19 patients, as high incidence of secondary infection caused by these two Gram-negative pathogens was observed in patients with severe COVID-19. Owing to the lack of knowledge of these coinfections, the choice of treatments with respect to antibiotic therapies in these patients were made with very limited clinical experience and a paucity of scientific evidence.

Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in the highest antimicrobial resistance threat category. Infections caused by this bacterium are difficult to treat and often associated with a very low survival rate. There is also an increasing trend of resistance to carbapenems, tigecycline and even the last resort drug colistin that severely limits the choice of therapies. This is, in a significant part, due to the presence of highly efficient multidrug efflux pumps that these bacteria carry to mediate antimicrobial resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22747, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To initiate a research effort for structure-based drug design to combat infections caused by K. pneumoniae, we defined cryo-EM structures of the KpAcrB multidrug efflux pump, in both the absence and the presence of the Ery macrolide. KpAcrB is the most predominant and clinically important multidrug efflux pump in K. pneumoniae. This pump relies on the PMF and functions via a drug/proton antiport mechanism. Coupled with the export of drug molecules toward the periplasm, protons need to be imported into the cytoplasm to energize this efflux process. Our cryo-EM maps unambiguously depict conformational changes of the side chains of residues D407, D408, K939, N940, and T977. These important residues are conserved among the HAE-RND efflux pumps and create the proton-relay network within the transmembrane helices. It has been found that a conserved lysine residue is critically important for proton transfer across the proton-relay network, where it participates as a proton sweeper to guide this process across the cytoplasmic membrane. In our cryo-EM structures, we observed that the conformation of K939 is quite distinct in protomers with different conformational states. This observation is in good agreement with what is seen in the N. gonorrhoeae MtrD, A. baumannii AdeB, and A. baumannii AdeJ multidrug efflux pumps. Therefore, the proton transfer mechanism found in KpAcrB may generally apply to inner membrane RND pumps in a myriad of bacterial organisms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24219, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "RND pumps often show a broad range of substrate specificity and play an important role in mediating intrinsic antibiotic resistance by directly extruding these drugs out of Gram-negative bacterial cells. However, it has been quite challenging to quantify drug efflux rates via these pumps mainly because these pumps need form a tripartite complex, spanning both the inner and the outer membranes, in order to export drugs. Using intact E. coli cells harboring the complete E. coli AcrAB-TolC multiprotein complex, the efflux rates of penicillins and cephalosporins from this complex have been determined. These experiments suggested that the Vmax (maximum velocity) values are between 0.35 and 1.1\u2009nmol/mg/s for efflux of penicillins, whereas these values are between 0.023 and 0.37\u2009nmol/mg/s for efflux of cephalosporins.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25046, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based upon the cryo-EM structures, we observed Ery to be bound deeply inside the periplasmic cleft of its distal drug-binding site.

This article also included two additional cryo-EM structures of MtrD bound by a novel nonantimicrobial cyclic cationic antimicrobial peptide and a colistin antimicrobial peptide.

In most cases, KpAcrB employs aromatic and hydrophobic residues, such as F136, F178, F614, F627, and V671, to contact structurally distinct drugs.
