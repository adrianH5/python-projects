SARS-CoV-2 Spike consists of an extracellular N-terminus, a transmembrane domain anchored within the viral membrane, and a small intracellular C-terminal domain. Within the extracellular domain, each Spike protomer contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) which can adopt one of two states\u2014a closed, or open state. When closed, the ACE2-binding interface faces downwards and is shielded, making it unavailable for binding. Upon transitioning to the open state, the RBD ACE2-binding site points upwards and becomes exposed, making it available for binding. This switch between up and down conformations suggests that Spike RBDs must transition to the open state prior to engaging the ACE2 receptor.

The use of detergents on glow-discharged grids increases grid surface hydrophilicity, which reduces surface tension by strengthening the interaction between the water molecules in the buffer and the surface of the grid. Furthermore, the addition of detergent reduces the tendency of proteins to adhere to the air-water interface within vitrified ice, as this phenomenon commonly results in protein denaturation as well as a preferred orientation of the protein particles, which could lead to a poor 3D reconstruction. Although in this study we use the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein as a model system to address how detergents change the protein conformation during cryo-EM structural determination, these observations may be broadly applicable to other protein structures resolved by cryo-EM as detergents are often included in the sample buffer.

While it has been previously shown that the addition of detergents resolves the preferred orientation issue by shifting the physical location of particles from the air-water interface to being embedded in the vitreous ice, we speculate that this change in physical environment may also be responsible for altering the Spike conformation.

In this setup, the protein resides within an aqueous environment instead of a thin layer of vitrified ice, therefore the addition of detergent does not redistribute or reorient the Spike molecules and thus has no impact on the openness of the RBD. Furthermore, this result is in alignment with our previous cryo-EM structural characterization of the D614G Spike global conformation in the absence of detergents, namely an RBD opening induced by this mutation. Despite differences in experimental design between cryo-EM and smFRET (e.g., Spike construct, fluorophore attachment, temperature differences), reaching a similar result via an orthogonal approach reveals that using multiple biophysical techniques to investigate conformational dynamics may be a useful approach to understanding SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein dynamics.
