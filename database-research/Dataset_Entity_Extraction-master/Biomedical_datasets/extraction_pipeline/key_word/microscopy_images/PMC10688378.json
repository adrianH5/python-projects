AAV-administered animals were imaged together with non-administered animals, under identical imaging settings, to control for autofluorescence. Control animals showed no fluorescent signal in the examined organs, compared to AAV animals, when visualized on the same scale. In the animals receiving single vector administrations, EGFP expression in kidney, lung, and spleen was examined, but undetectable above background levels. Liver fluorescence was not statistically significantly different between AAV7 and AAV9 (Fig. 5A). We hypothesize the difference in liver compared to the previous biodistribution study may be due to the increase in dose, which was necessary to obtain strong enough fluorescent protein expression to visualize without immunohistochemistry (IHC), and an additional PCR-based biodistribution study was performed (n = 2) to support CFT findings at the higher dose (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). CFT supports the biodistribution findings in the brain, showing the presence of weak fluorescence in the brain for both AAV7 and AAV9, though not significantly different from each other. In the spinal trigeminal tract, AAV9 transduction was significantly higher (P = 0.02) than AAV7 by 1.5\u00d7, which may indicate a preference of AAV9 for targeting trigeminal ganglion cells and by extension dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Skeletal muscle (forelimb and hindlimb) analysis further emphasizes increased expression by transduction with AAV9. In forelimb, AAV9-treated animals expressed EGFP 4.9-times more than AAV7 (P = 0.02). In contrast, heart transduction by AAV7 over AAV9 was observed (Fig. 5A, C, 6A and B). These differences are best visualized in the dual-vector administration animals, where expression within the same animal is represented by AAV7 in green and AAV9 in red (Fig. 5B and C).
