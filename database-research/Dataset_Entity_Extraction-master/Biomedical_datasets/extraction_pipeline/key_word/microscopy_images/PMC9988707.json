The SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase is intrinsically error prone, and it has been estimated that every single-nucleotide change in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome will be generated in an infected individual every day.

Secondly, mutations at the site of interaction of neutralizing antibody on S may reduce neutralizing titers, allowing reinfection or breakthrough of vaccines. Structure function analyses of panels of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated from convalescent SARS-CoV-2 cases have been performed by a number of laboratories, giving insight into the mechanisms of viral neutralization. Most potently neutralizing antibodies bind on, or near, the ACE2 interaction surface on the RBD to prevent interaction with ACE2.

Note that bebtelovimab (Ly-CoV1404) competes with S309 yet blocks ACE2 binding. A third site of binding of potent mAbs is to the N-terminal domain (NTD) in S1; these mAbs do not antagonize ACE2 binding, and the mechanism of neutralization is not yet clear, although steric hindrance of ACE2 interaction at the cell surface has been proposed.

S309 does not compete with ACE2, and a general feature is that many of the potent BA.2 antibodies are much further from the ACE2-binding site and, as a result, are less strongly competitive with ACE2 than early-pandemic antibodies (Figure\u00a02C). In contrast to the potent BA.2 chest binders identified here, the early-pandemic right flank antibodies, which bind nearby, were generally weakly neutralizing. These shifts in binding patterns are seen in the heatmaps of antibody binding between antibody responses produced successively through the pandemic (Figures 5A\u20135D).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34333, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The changed pattern of potent antibody binding is likely because almost all antibodies seem to be derived from responses induced by vaccination (and sometimes also SARS-CoV-2 infection). In support of this, every member of our set of potent antibodies to BA.2 potently cross-reacted with Wuhan-related strains and was likely originally induced by vaccination, since all donors were triple vaccinated. It is not clear whether the cross-reacting antibodies were fully matured before BA.2 infection or whether affinity maturation of lower affinity clones occurred in response to BA.2 infection. The panel probably contains a mix of both, and the strong representation of weaker neutralizing right flank antibodies in the early responses suggests that the chest binders that overlap these may have been matured to higher affinity and selected because this portion of the RBD has been subjected to less mutational change in BA.1 and BA.2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35267, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The change away from antibodies binding more directly on the ACE2 footprint is highlighted by the substantial role in early responses played by public gene families such as IGHV3-53/66, IGHV1-69, IGHV3-9, and IGHV1-58. Thus, in this article, the BA.2 IGHV1-69 mAbs are almost all knocked out by BA.4. Finally, the few members of the most frequently discovered gene family of all, IGHV3-53/66, that are active against BA.2 are severely affected by the F486S mutation in BA.75.2, as are the larger number of IGHV3-53/66 mAbs isolated following BA.1 infection. The refocusing is therefore explained by the evolution of the virus to the point of BA.1 and BA.2; however, there is no reason to think that residues on the right chest are required to be conserved. Indeed, the mutations in the recent sub-lineages are found on the edge or outside of the ACE2 epitope, deployed so as to effectively escape all three of the hotspots we see in BA.1 and BA.2 responses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36225, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, continuous attrition of the serological response and reliance on vaccine-induced clones to repopulate it is likely to reduce the memory pool and may limit the refocusing of the response required in the face of antigenic escape, increasing vulnerability.

However, background immunity, perhaps led by the T\u00a0cell response, which is less sensitive to mutations, will probably maintain protection against severe disease for the majority. Further monitoring of the antibody response throughout successive waves will tell us whether there is increasing attrition of polyclonality.
