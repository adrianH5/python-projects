A different, active conformation is observed at the branch junction, where the Arps interact side-by-side analogous to subunits of the short-pitch helix of the actin filament. The transition toward the active conformation proceeds through a global rotation of two blocks of subunits relative to one another, each containing one of the Arps. Additionally, during activation, the Arps undergo a rotation of their outer domain (subdomains 1 and 2) relative to their inner domain (subdomains 3 and 4) that produces a flatter conformation and readies the catalytic site for ATP hydrolysis, analogous to the monomeric (G-actin) to filamentous (F-actin) transition that takes place during actin polymerization.

The WCA region of N-WASP has been dimerized through the N-terminal addition of glutathione S-transferase (GST), a leucine zipper, or via chemical crosslinking, which all increase NPF\u2019s affinity for Arp2/3 complex and enhance activation. These methods, however, produce \u201cloose\u201d dimers that while useful for biochemical studies are unsuitable for structural analysis. Here, we used CapZ to obtain a CA dimer that would bind Arp2/3 complex stably for structural analysis. CapZ is ideal for this purpose because it naturally caps the barbed end and stops growth of the branch and shares structural features with the WH2 domain of NPFs that facilitate the design of the fusion construct. CapZ is a heterodimer of related \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. At the C-terminus, each subunit has an extension known as a tentacle. While structures of CapZ at the barbed end of F-actin are now available, when the CapZ-CA fusion was designed, the structure of CapZ had been only visualized at the barbed end of the Arp1 minifilament of dynactin. This structure showed that the \u03b1-tentacle (CapZ\u03b1 residues R260\u2013A286) and \u03b2-tentacle (CapZ\u03b2 residues R244\u2013N277) consisted of \u03b1-helices that inserted into the hydrophobic clefts of the two Arp1 subunits at the barbed end. While Arp1 shares only 51% sequence identity with actin, this interaction was expected to be conserved in F-actin. The hydrophobic cleft of actin is also the binding site of the N-terminal \u03b1-helix of the WH2 domain. By superimposing the structure of WH2-actin onto the last two subunits at the barbed end of the Arp1 mini-filament, we identified the best location to connect the CA region of N-WASP C-terminally to the \u03b1- and \u03b2-tentacles of CapZ (Fig. 1A).

These include a partial rotation of two blocks of subunits, each including one of the Arps, to position Arp2 and Arp3 in a near short-pitch conformation relative to one another. The Arps also adopt an intermediate conformation between twisted (G-actin-like) and flat (F-actin-like) states.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 23993, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We then asked whether the changes in equilibrium between inactive and active states observed with Arp2/3 complex activating cofactors resulted in changes in binding to the mother filament. For this, we used high-speed cosedimentation with F-actin (Fig. 4B). Alone, ~30% of Arp2/3 complex (1.5 \u03bcM) cosedimented with F-actin at the highest concentration tested (30 \u03bcM). The addition of Arpin CA (15 \u03bcM) did not significantly change Arp2/3 complex cosedimentation. Because Arpin inhibits the short-pitch transition, this finding is consistent with inactive Arp2/3 complex transiently binding the mother filament without this resulting in branch formation. In contrast, N-WASP WCA (15 \u03bcM) and CapZ-CA (1.5 \u03bcM) increased the fraction of Arp2/3 complex cosedimenting with F-actin to a similar extent (~44%), and a further increase was observed with actin-bound CapZ-CA (58%). Previous studies already showed that WCA favors binding of Arp2/3 complex to the mother filament and increases the efficiency of branch formation. A new observation here is that monomer binding to NPFs further shifts the equilibrium toward the short-pitch conformation and enhances mother filament binding.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 25175, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 25186, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Current models disagree as to whether Arp2/3 complex is activated through the concerted or unconcerted action of all the activating cofactors.

The most stable conformation is inactive, observed in all the structures of Arp2/3 complex outside the branch, including by itself with different bound nucleotides, or bound to NPFs, glia maturation factor, SPIN90, and Arpin. The active conformation is only observed at the branch junction, where it is stabilized by contacts with the mother and daughter filaments. However, there is ample evidence from crosslinking and spectroscopic measurements that the frequency with which Arp2/3 complex visits the short-pitch conformation increases in the presence of ATP, NPFs, and actin-bound NPFs. Here, we have shown that by shifting the equilibrium toward the short-pitch conformation the activating cofactors also favor binding to the mother filament and thus the likelihood of productive branch formation (Fig. 4), which is also consistent with previous findings. Yet, this preactivated state is not sufficiently stable to be captured in Arp2/3 complex structures. To overcome this limitation, we used here CapZ-fused CA to obtain a constitutively dimeric NPF that binds monomeric actin and caps the barbed end to trap the transition complex (Fig. 1B). The most populated conformation of this preactivated complex is structurally distinct from both the inactive state and the fully active state at the branch junction. However, this complex can also adopt conformations at both ends of the activation pathway, with large number of particles displaying structures closer to those of the inactive and active states (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E and F). In other words, the transition complex described here represents one among many states along the activation pathway (Fig. 4C). Notably, while actin delivery to both Arps is considered important during activation, actin was not bound at the barbed end of Arp2 in the current structure. This may have had a limited effect on the overall conformation of the transition complex, since actin delivery to Arp3 is thought to be more critical for activation. Predictably, however, if we could optimize the design of the hybrid CapZ-CA construct to deliver actin to Arp2, this might push the equilibrium further in the direction of the active conformation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 27796, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The conformational changes in this transition complex are not localized, but rather spread throughout the entire complex (Fig. 4C).

This finding rules out a model that proposes that activation proceeds in two separate steps. According to this model, the short-pitch transition occurs first, as a separate step depending only on NPF binding to Arp2/3 complex, but not on actin binding to NPF. Flattening of the Arps is proposed to occur as a second step upon binding to the mother filament. Instead, the structure of the transition complex supports an alternate model, proposing that the conformational changes induced by the activating cofactors are all coordinated. In other words, activation is a continuous transition, where every cofactor pushes the equilibrium further toward the activated state at the branch. According to this model, interactions of Arp2/3 complex with the mother and daughter filaments at the branch provide the change in free energy necessary to stabilize the fully active state.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 29022, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Role of the Nucleotide during Nucleation and Debranching.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 29080, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While an early study indicated that ATP binding produces a large conformational change in Arp2/3 complex, more recent evidence suggests that changes in the nucleotide state produce only minor structural changes in Arp2/3 complex, which is also the case in the actin filament. ATP hydrolysis by the Arps is also dispensable for branch network assembly in cells. However, crosslinking experiments show that the short-pitch transition is fully inhibited in the absence of ATP. Thus, ATP binding but not hydrolysis is necessary for activation. By helping release the inhibitory C-terminal tail of Arp3, ATP binding is thought to free the hydrophobic cleft of Arp3 for binding of the C domain of NPFs for activation. Since the nucleotide sits at the interface between the outer and inner domains in the actin fold, ATP binding may also be needed for flattening of the Arps during activation. Like with actin, flattening of the Arps rearranges the catalytic site of the Arps for ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis occurs fast upon branch formation. The branch ages with the release of \u03b3-phosphate, which favors branch disassembly and network turnover. In this way, the nucleotide plays key roles during both branch formation and disassembly.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30316, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Release of NPFs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 30333, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "NPFs dissociate immediately upon activation, and their release precedes branch elongation.

The WH2 domain binds preferentially to G-actin. Similarly, the C domain binds preferentially to inactive Arp2/3 complex. Therefore, we propose that flattening of actin and the Arps during activation reshapes their hydrophobic clefts, which lowers the affinity for NPFs.
