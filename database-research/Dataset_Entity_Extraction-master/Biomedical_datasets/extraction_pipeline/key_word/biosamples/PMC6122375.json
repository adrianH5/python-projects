This parasite is responsible for the majority of human VL cases in Brazil, the Middle East, China, Central Asia and the Mediterranean basin. Its main reservoir are domestic dogs which, similar to human patients, may develop severe visceral disease and die if not treated. The drug allopurinol is used for the long-term maintenance of dogs with canine leishmaniasis. Following our report of allopurinol resistance in treated relapsed dogs, we investigated the mechanisms and markers of resistance to this drug. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of clinical resistant and susceptible strains, and laboratory induced resistant parasites, was carried out in order to detect genetic changes associated with resistance. Significant gene copy number variation (CNV) was found between resistant and susceptible isolates at several loci, including a locus on chromosome 30 containing the genes LinJ.30.3550 through LinJ.30.3580. A reduction in copy number for LinJ.30.3560, encoding the S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (METK) gene, was found in two resistant clinical isolates and four induced resistant clonal strains. Using quantitative real time PCR, this reduction in METK copy number was also found in three additional resistant clinical isolates. Furthermore, inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase encoded by the METK gene in allopurinol susceptible strains resulted in increased allopurinol resistance, confirming its role in resistance to allopurinol. In conclusion, this study identified genetic changes associated with L. infantum resistance to allopurinol and the reduction in METK copy number identified may serve as a marker for resistance in dogs, and reduced protein activity correlated with increased allopurinol resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2052, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Graphical abstract", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2071, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Distribution of relative quantity values (RQ) of gene LinJ.30.3560 from the 20 L. infantum clinical strains in relation to their allopurinol IC50.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2218, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Highlights", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2229, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Allopurinol resistance was previously described in L. infantum isolated from dogs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2312, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "This study aimed at defining the genetic differences between susceptible and resistant strains.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2408, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Gene and chromosome copy numbers differed between susceptible and resistant L. infantum strains.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2505, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Decrease in METK gene copies was associated with increased allopurinol resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2588, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Inhibition of the enzyme encoded by METK increased allopurinol resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2663, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2676, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a debilitating, life threatening disease affecting hundreds of thousands of people annually.

Secondly, in these induced resistant strains, RQ values for the LinJ.30.3560 gene were 1.5 times lower or more compared to values seen for allopurinol susceptible control strains. This number translates to a deletion of one copy of this gene in the resistant strains compared to susceptible ones (in a diploid genome), and matches what was previously seen in the WGS data. Lastly, qPCR was performed for the 2 genes on all 20 clinical strains (supplementary Table 6). A moderate negative linear (R2\u202f=\u202f0.489) and quadratic (R2\u202f=\u202f0.57) correlation was found between RQ and IC50 values of each strain for LinJ.30.3560 (Fig. 5).

Allopurinol, on the other hand, is a purine nucleobase analog, and is unlikely to inhibit S-adenosylmethionine synthetase by the same mechanism as cycloleucine. Since lower METK gene copy number was found to be associated with resistance to allopurinol, it was interesting to see whether inhibition of METK activity by cycloleucine would result in increased allopurinol IC50 values in drug sensitive strains.

In the present study, resistant clonal strains were distinguishable in their ploidy pattern from susceptible ones, including their own allopurinol-susceptible close ancestry, suggesting a role for chromosome duplication in resistance. More specifically, an increase of 1.5\u20132 folds in copy numbers of chromosomes 8, 15 and 33 was found in resistant clonal isolates compared to the respective susceptible clonal isolates. Since a large cohort of genes are duplicated in each event of whole chromosome duplication, it is a challenging task to determine which are directly involved in adaptation to the stressor, and which are merely \u201cduplicated by proxy\u201d.

Of the 37 unique CNV's detected, we chose to focus on two shared by several strains, and therefore less likely to result from a random event. The first CNV was a deletion of the locus containing the LinJ.36.0790 gene, a hypothetical conserved protein, containing zinc-finger domains. The deletion was consistent among the 4 resistant clonal strains, highlighted by the estimated high number of copies in the susceptible clonal strains. Since this deletion was not shared by the 20 clinical isolates, this finding may represent a unique adaptation to in-vitro selection under drug pressure when strains were cultured as promastigotes. In contrast, the decreased copy number of the locus containing genes LinJ.30.3550 through LinJ.30.3580 was consistent across sequencing data of all in vitro clonal as well as clinical resistant strains. By following this CNV during induction of drug resistance in two separate experiments, a reduction in copy number could be seen over a time frame of several months, persisting for at least several months, and matching the shift to a resistant phenotype. A lower copy number of this locus was also found in additional resistant clinical strains by qPCR. This locus contains two genes, each with two copies, LinJ.30.3550/70 and METK (LinJ.30.3560/80). Arrangement, transcriptional regulation and expression have been studied for this gene cluster in L. infantum by, establishing among other findings that both genes are expressed throughout the parasite's life cycle, with possible stage-specific post transcriptional regulation of their level. The METK gene encodes S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a molecule involved in critical cellular functions such as trans-methylation, trans-sulphuration and polyamine synthesis in L. infantum. The LinJ.30.3550/70 gene encodes the LORIEN protein. The role of this protein is uncertain, but it contains a SP-RING/Miz zinc-finger motif, suggesting that it is related to the Small Ubiquitin related Modifier (SUMO) conjugation pathway, promoting post translational regulation of target proteins.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28385, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Focusing on this locus as a possible key player in allopurinol resistance of L. infantum, we performed experiments with the S-adenosylmethionine synthetase inhibitor cycloleucine to evaluate its influence on the allopurinol IC50 of L. infantum in culture. Increasing concentrations of cycloleucine resulted in higher allopurinol IC50 for all 4 susceptible strains tested. This finding is in line with the CNV results, suggesting that decreased levels of functional S-adenosylmethionine synthetase reduce allopurinol's inhibitory effect on the parasite. Amphotericin B, which exerts an inhibitory effect on Leishmania through its influence on membrane sterols, had an opposite effect on allopurinol IC50. The latter finding, suggests that results found with cycloleucine were not caused by a generic response to additional stress or to a mere growth inhibition by a second drug used in combination with allopurinol. Overexpression of S-adenosylmethionine in a resistant isolate together with a corresponding reduction in allopurinol IC50, will provide strong supporting evidence regarding the role of this enzyme in allopurinol susceptibility. However, our attempts to overexpress this gene using a Leishmania expression vector were so far unsuccessful, and confirmation by this technique awaits further studies. Together, these results demonstrate that the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase has an important role in allopurinol resistance, and raise new ideas concerning the mechanism by which allopurinol acts against this parasite. Since allopurinol can be incorporated into energetic nucleotides such as ATP it may be that such allopurinol containing nucleotides inhibit S-adenosylmethionine synthetase or are utilized by it, producing faulty products, which in turn inhibit the parasite's growth. Down-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase in resistant strains may reduce the levels of such faulty products. Increased transport of exogenous AdoMet via an alternative route that has been identified in Leishmania might compensate for the lower levels of de novo synthesis. Another possible explanation is that allopurinol inhibits enzymes involved in the metabolism of AdoMet working downstream to S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, and causing an increase in AdoMet levels with deleterious effect on the parasite via hypermethylation. A decrease in S-adenosylmethionine synthetase levels or activity may counter this effect, thereby causing drug resistance. A similar mechanism was described for S-adenosylmethionine synthetase and the drug dl-\u03b1-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). DFMO caused a sharp increase in AdoMet levels in susceptible Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense isolates, while in resistant ones both S-adenosylmethionine synthetase activity and AdoMet levels were much lower. The fact that two susceptible clinical strains in our study also demonstrated a reduced copy number for the METK gene could be because resistance may be multifactorial and associated with other mechanisms. Even though decrease in the METK gene copy number was the most prominent change detected, additional genetic modulations may also be involved.
