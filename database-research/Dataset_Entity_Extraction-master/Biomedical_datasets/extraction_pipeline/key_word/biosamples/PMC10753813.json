Thus far, epidemiologic studies and case reports have yielded insufficient data on the reciprocal impact of the two pathogens on either infection and related diseases. We established novel co-infection models to address this issue experimentally, employing either human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-expressing or wild-type mice, in combination with human- or mouse-infective variants of SARS-CoV-2, and the P. berghei rodent malaria parasite. We now show that a primary infection by a viral variant that causes a severe disease phenotype partially impairs a subsequent liver infection by the malaria parasite. Additionally, exposure to an attenuated viral variant modulates subsequent immune responses and provides protection from severe malaria-associated outcomes when a blood stage P. berghei infection was established. Our findings unveil a hitherto unknown host-mediated virus-parasite interaction that could have relevant implications for disease management and control in malaria-endemic regions.

During the ensuing blood stage of infection, the parasites cyclically invade and burst red blood cells (RBCs), giving rise to malaria symptoms and allowing parasite transmission upon ingestion of gametocyte-infected RBCs by the mosquito vector.

Although some variability between experimental groups was observed, the comprehensive analysis of the main cell populations involved in innate and adaptative immunity clearly revealed that animals exposed to maSCV2 displayed increased numbers of most circulating cell types relative to non-infected mice, at the time of parasite inoculation (two days after viral infection;  Figures\u00a04A  and  S5A ).

These mediators are released both locally and systemically, allowing the activation and recruitment of subsequent immune responses with the goal of limiting the spread of the infection. Severe disease-causing variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as AnSCV2, often induce an exacerbated activation of these inflammatory cascades, leading to a phenomenon known as \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, responsible for systemic damage of multiple tissues and organs.

In view of this epidemiological progression, a more attenuated and, thus, more clinically relevant co-infection model was established, employing an attenuated maSCV2. Although exposure to maSCV2 had no statistically significant effect on liver infection by P. berghei, its impact on malaria pathogenesis was clear when this stage was bypassed and the blood stage of infection was assessed. Our results showed that exposure to maSCV2 protected co-infected mice from severe neurological symptoms and significantly enhanced their overall survival, relative to P. berghei-single infected mice. Interestingly, these effects occurred independently of any alteration in parasite replication in the blood of co-infected animals, but were accompanied by significant modifications in the dynamics of NK and CD8+ T cells, two major immune cell populations involved in general responses against intracellular pathogens and implicated in ECM pathophysiology, which were not observed in mice solely infected with P. berghei.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29095, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that concurrent infections modulate malaria-associated outcomes. For instance, the lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), a macrophage-infecting virus which induces a persistent asymptomatic infection and prolonged viraemia in mice, has been reported to confer protection against P. berghei ANKA-induced ECM. This protection was attributed to the robust LDV-induced type I IFN response, leading to a functional impairment of key immune cell populations involved in ECM neuropathology. On the other hand, concomitant infection of P. berghei with the mosquito-borne Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) also conferred protection against ECM through a IFN-\u03b3-mediated retention of pathogenic CD8+ T cells in the spleen, preventing their migration to the brain. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2, infection by CHIKV spreads via the bloodstream, infecting various organs, including lymphoid tissues, where it can establish persistent infection. Besides the direct effect of soluble mediators on cell responses implicated in ECM development, this syndrome has been shown to be highly dependent on a synchronous sequestration of a critical number of infected RBCs and activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells within the brain microcirculation, along with the establishment of a local inflammatory environment. Therefore, a decoupling of these critical events could result in the failure to trigger the inflammatory responses associated with brain pathology. Our blood immunophenotyping data showed that challenge with P. berghei blood stage parasites led to distinct immune responses in mice primarily exposed to maSCV2 compared to the P. berghei-single infected hosts. Specifically, not only did the former exhibit a less pronounced decrease in circulating NK and CD8+ T cells than the latter, but they also did not show the decline in activated central memory (TCM) and effector/effector memory (TEM) CD8+ T cells observed in the P. berghei-single infected animals. Although a heightened production or proliferation of these cell types during co-infection might account for these findings, it is also plausible that cell mobilization to inflamed tissues, such as the brain, is reduced in co-infected animals, thus disrupting the inflammatory events that lead to ECM. Furthermore, our results suggest that co-infection led to an upregulation of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) in circulating T cells. Since PD-1 expression by T cells has been associated with reduced pro-inflammatory responses and increased protection against ECM, it can also be hypothesized that initial exposure to the maSCV2 could have increased survival by functionally impairing these cells and decreasing immune-mediated pathology. Nonetheless, further investigation is required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of the observed protection against ECM in the context of a localized respiratory viral infection, as well as the functional role of each immune cell type in this phenotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32078, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to experimentally address the impact of primary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 on the outcomes of a subsequent Plasmodium infection in relevant in vivo models.

Besides, when a controlled and effective anti-viral immune response occurs, the differential activation of circulating immune cells might interfere with the establishment of the brain-localized inflammatory events required for the development of ECM.
