Although relatively few in number, some of the largest genetic changes that differentiate humans from archaic hominins involve gene-rich SDs. Among human-specific SD genes, the duplications of TCAF1/TCAF2 are particularly intriguing. These genes encode TRP channel-associated factors that bind to the protein TRPM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8)\u2014the ion channel acting as thermal sensor in peripheral somatosensory neurons and are thought to be under positive selection in Eurasian populations. Both TCAF1 and TCAF2 proteins interact directly with the TRPM8 channel but have antagonistic effects in TRPM8 gating and trafficking into the plasma membrane: while TCAF1 facilitates the TRPM8 channel opening and migration, the activity of TRPM8 is completely suppressed by TCAF2.

Similarly, Haplogroup 3 can also be further classified into two subgroups, Haplogroup 3-1 and Haplogroup 3-2, because we predict that they likely derived from two different large deletions with respect to Haplogroup 4 (Fig.\u00a02 and Supplementary Data\u00a03). Finally, while Haplogroup 1 has a similar structure to the nonhuman primate haplotypes, we showed that this group is more closely related to Haplogroup 3 and likely a result of a deletion event over Haplogroup 3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010 and Supplementary Data\u00a03).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17706, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The breakpoints of these six large structural differences map within nearly identical (>99.5%) SDs, consistent with the action of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) (Supplementary Data\u00a03).

In addition, our analysis of sequence composition reveals the presence of nearly identical LINE/SINE elements in sequences flanking the putative breakpoints (Supplementary Data\u00a03).

Functional studies have shown that TCAF1/TCAF2 are highly expressed in the prostate, brain, esophagus, prostate, and skin tissues (GTEx Portal, https://gtexportal.org). To this end, we targeted capture of FLNC TCAF transcripts and generated 480,700 FLNC transcripts from six human tissues, including dorsal root ganglion, esophagus, fibroblast, skin, fetal brain, and testis, as well as 50,885 FLNC transcripts from a chimpanzee lymphoblast cell line (Supplementary Data\u00a04).

Of note, we followed the previously described nomenclature to delineate TCAF models and isoforms. Overall, our analysis indicates the expression of TCAF genes in a wide variety of tissues and reveals diverse TCAF paralogs as well as isoforms (Fig.\u00a03 and Supplementary Figs.\u00a05\u201313; Supplementary Data\u00a05). In particular, we recovered only single isoforms for individual genes in the TCAF1 subfamily. In contrast, the TCAF2 subfamily shows much more diversity with 10, 2, and 4 isoforms being identified for TCAF2A, TCAF2C1, and TCAF2C2, respectively. With respect to the current annotation in the human reference genome (GRCh38), all haplotypes confirm that TCAF2A (or TCAF2 in RefSeq Release 200) is incorrectly annotated due to the presence of a gap at this locus (Fig.\u00a03).

Specifically, all TCAF1A1/TCAF1A2 paralogs match to the last seven exons of TCAF1B, while the TCAF2C1/TCAF2C2 paralogs consist of the first three exons of TCAF2A (Fig.\u00a03). In addition, the predicted breakpoints between Haplogroup 2-2 and Haplogroup 5 coincide with the TCAF1A1 and TCAF1A2 paralogs. The sequence alignment analysis shows that the breakpoint at Haplogroup 2-2 spans from the third to the fifth introns, and thus, the TCAF1A1 copy of Haplogroup 2-2 is a fusion version of the TCAF1A1 and TCAF1A2 copies of Haplogroup 5 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). Because the amino acid sequences encoded from these three paralogs are 100% identical, this suggests the actual breakpoints are within one of the three introns. Finally, the 100\u2009kbp inversion between Haplogroup 4 and Haplogroup 5 raises the question whether the large-scale structural variation event has any effect on TCAF coding sequences. Notably, the inferred inversion breakpoints map to the second introns of TCAF2A and TCAF2C2. There are only two differences in the TCAF2A exon alignment between Haplogroups 4 and 5: one is a synonymous change in the second exon, and the other causes a nonsynonymous change (R479Q) in the third exon, which is beyond the inferred breakpoints (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). Thus, our results predict that this inversion shuffles the last six exons of TCAF2A, which were ligated with the first two exons of different TCAF2A/TCAF2C2 paralogs on the two haplotypes without disrupting or altering the coding sequence potential of TCAF2A/TCAF2C2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22712, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It should be noted that although the structural changes largely increase and decrease the dosage of individual TCAF family members with relatively few predicted amino-acid differences, there is evidence that structural mutations and\u00a0gene conversion events are likely affecting the regulatory landscape.

Using paralog-specific copy number genotypes (Methods), we found a reduction in copy number at this locus (i.e., the acceptor site; chr7:143,615,002\u2013143,624,482, GRCh38; the left white box, Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a015), which, interestingly, is significantly negatively correlated with an increase in copy number at its paralogous locus (the donor site; chr7:143,833,163\u2013143,842,658; the right white box, Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a015) (Pearson\u2019s correlation\u2009=\u2009\u22120.3, p value\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216) in multiple continental populations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016). This result is consistent with the hypothesis of an IGC event copying the donor sequence over the acceptor locus, resulting in reciprocal copy number changes at these two loci. Notably, we find that this paralog-specific copy number at the donor locus is negatively correlated (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.18, p value\u2009=\u20093.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127) with the (absolute) latitudinal location of human populations while the relationship for the acceptor site is positive (R\u2009=\u20090.23, p value\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221211; Supplementary Fig.\u00a017).

Together, these findings are consistent with a recent TCAF SD expansion or IGC. We considered each of the duplicated segments independently guarding against confounders such as IGC and NAHR events. Because several SDs represent hybrids of two SD paralogs due to NAHR fusion events (Fig.\u00a02), for example, we restricted our analysis to the larger segments of hybrid SDs. To minimize the effects of IGC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014), we applied GENECONV (v1.81a) to exclude sites corresponding to 80.5%, 61.7%, and 70.6% of DupA, DupB, and DupC sequences, respectively (Supplementary Data\u00a07).

Due to the limitations of short-read data, we restricted this analysis to three unique regions (52.3\u2009kbp in total) flanking and internal to the TCAF locus (Fig.\u00a01). We identified 1,275 SNVs (QV\u2009>\u200920) and used these to computationally phase and to construct haplotypes from 802 samples (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and 24).

We should note that these time estimates are subject to uncertainties, such as mutation rate, and therefore caution is warranted when interpreting these dates (Methods).

Phylogenetic reconstruction using 10 haplotypes drawn at random from each cluster reproducibly shows a maximum likelihood tree closely resembling this cluster-based relationship (Fig.\u00a05b).

Based on the BAC references, we identified four tagging SNVs in the unique diploid region embedded among the TCAF SDs that could distinguish super haplogroups H4 and H5 (Fig.\u00a06). Because the two super haplogroups structurally differ by a 100\u2009kbp inversion, we expect a reduction of homologous recombination events between the two groups and therefore an increase in linkage disequilibrium (LD) in hominins.

Such regions, however, are often frequently overlooked as part of comparative studies, association studies, or scans of selection because of their structural complexity and high degree of homology. In this study, we first delineate the complex structural diversity of the TCAF locus in humans and compare it to nonhuman primates at the sequence level in order to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Of note, the complete assembly of 15 haplotypes by tedious BAC-based sequencing was sufficient to capture more than half of the genetic diversity of TCAF SDs in humans. Based on these data, we develop a model of rapid diversification with respect to both haplotype and TCAF SD copy number diversity (Figs.\u00a01\u20133). It is worth noting that despite the recent advances in long-read sequence assembly, the most complex haplotypes still remain collapsed and unassembled in some of the recently released human genomes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04 and Supplementary Data\u00a02). We believe that this is due partly to the read-length limitation of the data as well as the near-perfect sequence identity among TCAF SDs that lead to ambiguous read partitions during haplotype assembly.

The high degree of sequence identity among TCAF paralogs (>99.7%), their clustered and tandem orientation, and their large size (10\u201360\u2009kbp) promote recurrent structural rearrangements making the entire locus genetically unstable as a result of NAHR. Human Haplogroups 4 and 5, in particular, carry more TCAF SD paralogs than others, and, thus, both are predicted to be subject to a higher likelihood of structural mutation. Our analysis predicts that H4 would be more predisposed to structural rearrangements than H5 due to a greater number of directly orientated duplications (DupA and DupB) (Fig.\u00a02). This prediction is consistent with the observation of more subgroups within supergroup H4 in the haplotype-based PCA (Supplementary Figs.\u00a027\u201330). Surprisingly, this predisposition to recurrent structural diversity is specific to modern-day humans as our sampling of eight archaic hominin haplotypes suggests a static H4 haplogroup without a single duplication event.

Interestingly, the analysis uncovered a significant correlation between paralog-specific copy number and the latitudinal location of human populations precisely over a potential enhancer region, suggesting that IGC may have contributed to regulatory differences of TCAF genes among human populations. Such co-option of IGC has been noted before among duplicate genes. For example, a human-specific, pseudogene-mediated IGC of SIGLEC11 replaced the 5\u2032 upstream region and coding exons of SIGLEC11 by its adjacent pseudogene SIGLEC16P in the human lineage. This event has been hypothesized as adaptive during human brain development.

Gene duplication has been known to be an important source of genetic novelty and adaptive evolution, especially for the great ape lineages given the surge of duplications predicted to have occurred in the hominid ancestor. Throughout the evolution of mammals, TCAF genes have been highly conserved, and human is the only lineage that is known to carry additional copies. The coding sequences among the individual paralogs are highly conserved as a result of their recent origin arguing for the relative importance of TCAF dosage differences in regulating the TRPM8 ion channel as suggested by a previous study. We also observe, however, considerable isoform diversity as a result of the incomplete nature of the SD particularly among TCAF2 paralogs suggesting a potentially more complex relationship with the ancestral genes. This pattern of incomplete duplication resembles the evolution of the neural human-specific duplication SRGAP2 genes, where the younger, incomplete duplicated paralog SRGAP2C inhibits the function of the ancestral copy SRGAP2A, and in mice experiments this in turn prolongs the maturation of synapses and subsequently increases the density and the length of synapses.

While the exact mechanism and phenotype that balancing selection are acting upon are not clear, the differential eQTL signal related to TCAF2 expression between supergroup H4 and H5 alleles in multiple tissues would be consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy, where two haplotypes have opposing effects on two different traits depending on either environmental or life-history conditions.

The negative Tajima\u2019s D and Fay and Wu\u2019s H values at this locus compared with those of the genome-wide and simulated values, which accounts for differences explained by demographic history, suggest that the observation of the single-haplotype without duplication in the archaic samples is unlikely under neutrality. Using coalescent simulations to assess the significance of a population genetics test is known to be more reliable than choosing outliers as candidates because these simulations explicitly account for effects of population demographic history and genomic variation in mutation and recombination rates. However, we also note that our selection inference is limited by our understanding regarding the demography of these archaic hominins and the underlying models and should be further tested in the future by incorporating new archaic samples and demographic models.

Moreover, recent studies demonstrated the role of TRPM8 in energy homeostasis; specifically, it is required for precise thermoregulation in response to cold in the fed and fasting states in mice. Not only is TRPM8 required for cold detection in mice, but TRPM8-knockout mice raised at mild cold temperatures develop late-onset obesity and display a metabolic dysfunction with a higher content of lipid droplets in liver. This implies that the TRPM8 ion channel, in addition to its role in detecting environmental cold, is a known regulator of insulin homeostasis through neuronal control of liver insulin clearance and, thus, required for precise thermoregulatory responses to cold and fasting.

We note that the 95% HPD intervals for the human\u2013chimpanzee and human\u2013gorilla divergences are [5.9\u2009\u00d7\u2009106, 7.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009106] and [8.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009106, 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009107] years ago, respectively, and are compatible to other published estimates. However, the 95% highest-posterior density (HPD) of the strict clock rate is [6.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210, 9.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210] per substitution per year, which is higher than the recent pedigree-based mutation rate of 4.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210 per nucleotide per year (95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20093.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210\u2212 4.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 68102, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition, to validate the BEAST inferred tree, we reconstructed the phylogeny for the same sequences using both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, implemented in MEGA X (v10.1.8). We used the default settings and ran each analysis with 1,000 bootstrap samples. Although bootstrap support for both trees was low overall, we find that the maximum-parsimony tree closely recapitulates the topology of the BEAST tree (Supplementary Fig.\u00a044). While the neighbor-joining tree differs slightly in its topology, both trees suggest that the archaic hominin haplotypes are more closely related to human supergroup H4 than H5 and thus unlikely to be derived from ancestral ape sequence.

Haplotypes were inferred by applying BEAGLE (v5.1-25Nov19.28d) with default settings to modern human, archaic hominin, and chimpanzee samples separately. We explored the diversity of the TCAF haplotype using a haplotype-based PCA to classify and assign haplotypes into individual clusters. Cluster assignments were based on the supervised k-means algorithm using the top N informative PCs, where . To determine the best number of cluster k, for each possible k between 1 and 20, we computed the within groups sum of squares (WSS) using a distance matrix among the top N PCs and determined the best k when , where delta was chosen as 500 according to our analysis. Data visualization of the haplotype clustering was performed using the machine-learning technique t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) implemented in the R package Rtsne (v0.15) using the following parameters: \u201cperplexity\u2009=\u200950, max_iter\u2009=\u20095000, early_exag_coeff\u2009=\u200912, exaggeration\u2009=\u20094, stop_lying_iter\u2009=\u20091000, check_duplicates\u2009=\u2009FALSE, dims\u2009=\u20093\u201d.

Because these statistics are sensitive to population history, we performed a large coalescent simulation using both MaCS and msprime (v0.7.4) and demographic models as described previously that were implemented in the Python package Stdpopsim (v0.1.2). For each of the models, we generate 10,000 whole-genome simulations to account for past histories between modern and archaic hominins and among multiple African and non-African populations (Supplementary Data\u00a09) and use chimpanzee as the outgroup. Note that our simulations carefully match the local mutation rate and recombination rate variation at these regions to avoid possible biases to our selection inferences. To estimate the TMRCA for a locus of interest, we used the Thomson\u2019s estimator. To perform a haplotype-based PCA, we first recode haplotype bases as numeric codes, where 0 and 1 (and 2 if needed) are ancestral (using chimpanzee as the outgroup) and derived alleles, respectively. We performed the haplotype-based PCA following the suggestion described in Browning et al 2016 but using the R package irlba (v2.3.3) to calculate principal components. LD measurements among SNVs were computed using Lewontin\u2019s D\u2032 and R2 implemented in PLINK (v1.09).
