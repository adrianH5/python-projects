Infections can be treated with colistin but some isolates are resistant to this antibiotic. To better understand the genetic basis of resistance, we experimentally evolved 19 independent resistant mutants from the susceptible laboratory strain PAO1. Whole genome sequencing identified mutations in multiple genes including phoQ and pmrB that have previously been associated with resistance, pitA that encodes a phosphate transporter, and carB and eno that encode enzymes of metabolism. Individual mutations were engineered into the genome of strain PAO1. Mutations in pitA, pmrB and phoQ increased the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for colistin 8-fold, making the bacteria resistant. Engineered pitA/phoQ and pitA/pmrB double mutants had higher MICs than single mutants, demonstrating additive effects on colistin susceptibility. Single carB and eno mutations did not increase the MIC suggesting that their effect is dependent on the presence of other mutations. Many of the resistant mutants had increased susceptibility to \u03b2-lactams and lower growth rates than the parental strain demonstrating that colistin resistance can impose a fitness cost. Two hundred and fourteen P. aeruginosa isolates from a range of sources were tested and 18 (7.8%) were colistin resistant. Sequence variants in genes identified by experimental evolution were present in the 18 resistant isolates and may contribute to resistance. Overall our results identify pitA mutations as novel contributors to colistin resistance and demonstrate that resistance can reduce fitness of the bacteria.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1811, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1824, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The Gram negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes severe infections in patients with predisposing conditions such as bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis or other chronic forms of lung disease and in people who are hospitalised or immunocompromised, causing a burden for public health.

Colistin belongs to the polymyxin class of antibiotics, of which polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) are used for treatment. Colistin is on the list of essential medicines from the WHO. It has been considered as a \u2018last line of defence\u2019 antibiotic reserved for treatment of infections by multidrug resistant Gram negative pathogens due to its side effect of rapid deterioration of kidney function. However the development of an aerosilised form that can be inhaled directly to treat lung infections has reduced toxic side effects and it is commonly used in treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis or other forms of bronchiectasis. An increased use of colistin has resulted in the emergence of colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa, with up to 10% of P. aeruginosa being resistant in some studies. Resistance to an antibiotic can alter susceptibility to other antibiotics and can also affect bacterial fitness. Knowledge of whether colistin resistance affects susceptibility to other antibiotics or affects bacterial fitness is limited but could help to improve treatment options for patients with infections of colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3805, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Polymyxins work by interacting with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the Gram negative cell envelope, resulting in cell death due to disruption of the outer membrane and loss of its barrier function as well as interaction with nascent LPS at the cytoplasmic membrane and generation of hydroxyl radicals. In P. aeruginosa resistance commonly involves modification of lipid A of lipopolysaccharide by attachment of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) or phosphoethanolamine (pEtN), reducing the negative charge of the LPS and consequently its affinity of colistin. Mutations in the two component systems PhoPQ, PmrAB, ParRS and CprRS can all result in increased expression of the arnBCADTEF-ugd (pmrHFJKLME) operon that encodes enzymes required for attachment of L-Ara4N to lipid A and plays a key role in colistin resistance [reviewed in ]. Increased expression of the eptA gene leads to the addition of the cationic substance pEtN to lipid A resulting in reduced colistin affinity. In other species resistance to colistin can also arise through acquisition of resistance genes of the mcr family, located on mobile genetic elements. Mcr genes also confer resistance by causing addition of pEtN to lipid A. Although the above mechanisms for colistin resistance are relatively well understood, understanding of the genetic basis of colistin resistance and its effects on fitness or susceptibility to other antibiotics is incomplete. One approach to better understand the basis and consequences of colistin resistance is to carry out experimental evolution studies. Mutants of P. aeruginosa that were resistant to colistin in liquid culture have been developed in two studies and both identified mutations in pmrB, lpxC and mutS, while mutations in other genes were observed in only one of the two studies.

These modifications likely reduce the affinity of LPS for colistin. Our findings suggest two additional mechanisms for modification of LPS. Both the engineered and transposon pitA mutations, in the absence of any other mutations, resulted in an increase of MIC50 for colistin by 8-fold (Fig 2A and 2B). That change of MIC50 was sufficient for strain PAO1 to become resistant. The PitA protein has recently been identified as playing a role in phosphate uptake. Phosphate groups present in the inner core of LPS can contribute to colistin binding. Reduced availability of phosphate may reduce the amount of negatively charged phosphate in the LPS (Fig 3C), reducing affinity for the positively charged colistin molecules and hence reducing the MIC50. However colistin\u2019s mode of action is complex and involves disruption of both the inner and outer membranes as well as generation of hydroxyl radicals. Mutations in pitA alter the proton motive force and so resistance associated with pitA mutations may also be due to the changed membrane potential reducing cellular entry of the positively charged colistin molecules, or reducing the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Intriguingly, deletion of pitA did not affect colistin resistance in strain PA14, perhaps because the amount of phosphate in LPS varies between isolates.
