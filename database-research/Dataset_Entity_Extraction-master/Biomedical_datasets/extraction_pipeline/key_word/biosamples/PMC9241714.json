Three penicillin and ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, NIID576, NIID614, and NIID620, recovered from individuals in different prefectures, were classified as the same nontypeable serogroup ST-32 CC strains harboring both penA33 (identified previously in penicillin-nonsusceptible strains) and gyrA376 with a T91I substitution responsible for ciprofloxacin resistance (Fig.\u00a01). These isolates were clustered with the penicillin-resistant and ciprofloxacin-susceptible serogroup B, ST-32 CC strains identified in Malta and New Zealand.
