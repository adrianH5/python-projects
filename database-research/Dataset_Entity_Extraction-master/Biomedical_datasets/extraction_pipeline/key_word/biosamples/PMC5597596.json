Dominant Red (e\u2013h) is distinct from the traditional recessive red allele of the Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1Re) found in Holstein. It emerged in 1980 with the birth of a red mutant heifer (MC1RD/D & DRDR/+) from parents which were homozygous for the dominant black allele (MC1RD/D & DR+/+). In adulthood MC1RD/D & DRDR/+ dominant red animals (e,f) display substantial variations in colour ranging from a light brown which is close to the MC1Re/e & DR+/+ recessive red coat (g), to a dark brown close to MC1RD/D & DR+/+ dominant black coat (h). Neurocristopathy (NC) was observed in half of the progeny of a mildly affected Montb\u00e9liarde bull. Its main symptoms include hypotonia (i), lack of balance and coordination in the days following birth, facial abnormalities, heart defects and growth delay. Osteogenesis imperfecta type 2 (OI), is characterized by brittle bones that are prone to fracture (e.g. hind limbs in j). It has been reported in 29% of the progeny of an unaffected Fleckvieh bull. Bulldog (BD) calf syndrome is a lethal form of chondrodysplasia characterized by a generalized shortening of long bones (k,l).

Finally, the absence of pigment was evidenced in the choroid of affected versus control animals (Fig.\u00a03d,e). This set of evidence confirmed at the microscopic level the perfect similarity between the human and bovine conditions. A gene expression study showed that in white skin samples from MITF p.R211del/+ animals, MITF was normally expressed and that, in agreement with the absence of melanin synthesis, MITF target genes such as TYR, TYRP1 and DCT were down-regulated (Fig.\u00a03i). Interestingly, the expression of these genes was only partially restored in revertant patches from the same individuals as compared with wild type controls. To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in this phenotypic reversion, we extracted genomic DNA and RNA from white and black skin biopsies from three MITF p.R211del/+ animals. Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from white and black skin patches did not reveal any sign of genetic reversion (i.e. of mutation from the mutant allele back to the wild type; Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). In addition, a pyrosequencing test was used to quantify allelic expression. We found no difference in the wild type/mutant allele ratio between white and black skin samples from the same animals (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010) indicating that neither genetic reversion nor allelic imbalance were involved in the phenotypic reversion observed. The persistence of revertant patches throughout life, their location in areas of the body rich in terms of melanocytes, and the dominant negative effect of this mutation suggest a stochastic aetiology in which rare melanoblasts having slightly higher levels of wildtype homodimers, would undergo a nearly normal differentiation.

In addition, it gave us a unique opportunity to map modifier loci influencing the clinical features of CHARGE syndrome. Although the usual approach is to compare mildly and severely affected individuals, the rapid death of the latter animals prevented the sampling of a sufficient number of them (n\u2009=\u20097). Therefore, we compared haplotype frequencies for sliding windows of 10 markers between 49 mildly affected animals and 89 unaffected half-sibs genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Beadchip, using Fisher\u2019s exact test for allelic association.

This ten-fold enrichment in frequency between the mildly affected and control animals is particularly striking considering that the first group consists approximately of the 10% least affected individuals among carriers of the CHD7 frameshift mutation (see Methods).

In humans, mutations in EDAR and in other members of the ectodysplasin pathway (i.e. EDA and EDARADD) are known to cause anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (AED, MIM: 305100, 129490, 224900, 614940 and 614941), a syndrome characterized by hypotrichosis (sparseness of hair), hypo- or an-hidrosis (reduced ability to sweat), and hypodontia (congenital absence of teeth). Here, we took advantage of the Charolais natural mating population which has a shorter generation interval than AI breeding schemes and mined the pedigree databases for consanguineous matings between descendants of \u201cInvincible\u201d. We estimated that 14 out of 344,564 Charolais calves born in 2013 were expected to be homozygous mutants. In agreement with this estimation, a survey enabled us to detect ten calves, born from unaffected parents, and showing symptoms of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (see Methods, Fig.\u00a06 and Supplementary Figs\u00a018 and 19). Of note, affected calves grew normal horns suggesting that the ectodysplasin pathway, which plays a key role in the differentiation of skin appendages in vertebrates, is not involved in horn ontogenesis. Thus, these animals represent an appealing model in evolutionary and developmental biology. Genotyping of seven affected calves using the Illumina BovineSNP50 array revealed that, at the genome scale, they were homozygous for a single shared haplotype of 26\u2009Mb on chromosome 11, encompassing EDAR. Subsequent genotyping by PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed that these seven animals were also homozygous for the EDAR p.P161RfsX97 mutation. Furthermore, screening of the French genomic selection database (8179 Charolais animals) revealed the existence of three unaffected animals which were also homozygous for the same 26-Mb IBD segment but only heterozygous for the EDAR mutation. Pedigree analysis demonstrated that one of the haplotypes of these individuals could be traced back to Invincible whereas the other haplotype originated from the sire of Invincible and not directly from him. These results confirm the causality of the mutation and validate our approach for anticipating the emergence of new recessive disorders.

For each genetic defect we assumed the causative mutation is dominant and occurred de novo. We therefore retained only heterozygous polymorphisms that were absent from analogous whole genome sequencing data from 1230 control animals (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Analysis of pedigree information, demonstrated that none of the 1230 control animals were descended from any of the first mutant animals for the different conditions studied.

Briefly, RNA was extracted from skin samples from three dominant red and three dominant black animals. cDNA libraries were generated and sequenced as paired-end 50 base pair reads on an Illumina HiSeq. 2000 instrument. Differential expression analyses were performed using DESeq. 2 package. For details see Dorshorst et al.. In this study, a threshold of FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 was used to evaluate significant expression changes between dominant red and dominant black skin samples (Supplementary Data\u00a01). Transcript annotation was updated using Ensembl release 88 and information from the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/; accessed 2017/04/01). We used the \u201cNon-cow RefSeq genes,\u201d \u201cCow mRNAs from GenBank\u201d and \u201cCow ESTs that have been spliced\u201d tracks to recover the name of protein-coding genes that are predicted to code \u201cunknown protein\u201d according to Ensembl. Gene set enrichment analyses were carried out with two software packages using different methods and sources of information. To provide a first overview of the over-represented groups of genes, we performed two analyses with Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) using the list of genes that are significantly upregulated (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05, fold change >1) and downregulated (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05, fold change <1). We focused on Mammalian Phenotype ontology from Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI Mammalian Phenotype Level 3 and 4) to gain information on the possible phenotypic consequences associated with modification of gene expression in dominant red versus dominant black animals. Then we performed two analyses with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa/) using two list of genes (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 and fold change >2 or <0.5, respectively) to identify canonical pathways that are markedly upregulated or downregulated.
