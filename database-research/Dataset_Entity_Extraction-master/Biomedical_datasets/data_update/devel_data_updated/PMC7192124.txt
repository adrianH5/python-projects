A new virus-associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was initially reported in China on 30th December 2019 (Wu et al., 2020).
The causative agent of COVID-19 is the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020), and, as of 24th March 2020, there have been 372,757 confirmed infections and 16,231 deaths reported worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020).
In China, the COVID-19 epidemic grew exponentially during January 2020, peaking on 12th February 2020 with 15,153 newly confirmed cases per day.
One month later, reported COVID-19 cases in China dropped to ~20 per day, indicating the epidemic there was contained.
By 11th March 2020, the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 to be a new pandemic, 37,371 cases had been reported outside of China (World Health Organization, 2020).
Our results may provide valuable information for implementing and interpreting genomic surveillance of COVID-19 in other regions.
COVID-19 cases in Guangdong grew until early February 2020 (peaking at >100 cases per day) and declined thereafter (Figure 1
A).
However, since the beginning of March 2020 COVID-19 cases imported into Guangdong from abroad have been detected with increasing frequency.
As of 26th March 2020, a total of 102 imported cases were reported from 19 different countries (Figure 1A), highlighting the risk that local COVID-19 transmission could reignite in China.
More intensive surveillance was initiated on 30th January 2020 in response to the Spring Festival period, which results in greater mobility among regions and provinces in China (Kraemer et al., 2020, Tian et al., 2020) and because asymptomatic COVID-19 cases had been reported (Guan et al., 2020).
Surveillance commenced at Guangdong airports in early March, following the growth of COVID-19 outbreaks outside of China.
To understand the genetic structure of the COVID-19 outbreak in Guangdong, we generated near-complete and partial genomes from 53 COVID-19 patients in Guangdong Province.
The median tMRCA estimate of the COVID-19 pandemic was 1st December 2019 (95% HPD 15th November to 13th December 2019; Figure 4), consistent with previous analyses (Rambaut, 2020).
Our analyses of the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong province indicate that, following the first COVID-19 case detected in early January, most infections were the result of virus importation from elsewhere, and that chains of local transmission were limited in size and duration.
However, vigilance is still required as there remains a risk that SARS-CoV-2 transmission could reignite in Guangdong following the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases imported to China from other countries.
Further, the low and variable sampling of COVID-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region; although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission, our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically undersampled location.
The accession numbers for the sequences reported in this paper are GISAID: EPI_ISL_413850–413902.
Suspected COVID-19 cases were screened by 31 designated hospitals, local CDCs in 21 prefecture cities, and 6 third-party detection institutions with commercial real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits (see below for further details).
These cities recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases (Figure 1B).
We collected a further 21 samples from 18 patients from a screening project of hospitalized COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, which was launched on 28th February.
Virus genomes were generated by two different approaches, (i) untargeted metagenomic sequencing on the BGI MGISEQ-2000 (n = 63) and Illumina NextSeq (n = 4) sequencing platforms, and (ii) using version 1 of the ARTIC COVID-19 multiplex PCR primers (https://artic.network/ncov-2019), followed by nanopore sequencing on an ONT MinION (n = 45).
The ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for COVID (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) was used to generate consensus sequences and call single nucleotide changes relative to the reference sequence.
Assembly of the nanopore raw data was performed using the ARTIC bioinformatic pipeline for COVID-19 with minimap2 (Li, 2018) and medaka (https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) for consensus sequence generation.
All available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (n = 323) on GISAID (gisaid.org) on 13th March 2020 were downloaded.
Sequences from GISAID that were error-rich, those which represented multiple sequences from the same patient, and those without a date of sampling were removed.
Finally, the dataset was reduced by only retaining the earliest and most recently sampled sequences from epidemiologically linked outbreaks (e.g., the Diamond Princess cruise ship).
The resulting dataset of 250 sequences therefore represents the global diversity of the virus while minimizing the impact of sampling bias.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was first reported in central China in December 2019.
Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required, because the number of cases imported from other countries has increased.
Effective control measures helped reduce and eliminate chains of viral transmission      Genomic and epidemiological analyses provide insights into how COVID-19 was contained in China’s most populous province using a combination of surveillance and travel restriction measures.
