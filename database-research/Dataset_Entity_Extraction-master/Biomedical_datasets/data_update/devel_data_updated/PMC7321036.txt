The pathophysiology of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is similar to that of severe disease caused by SARS-CoV and is characterized by acute respiratory distress and excessive inflammation capable of inducing respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and death (Wong et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2020).
These characteristics contribute to the difficulty of containing SARS-CoV-2 spread through public health strategies and amplify the need to develop vaccines and therapies to protect against and treat COVID-19.
Clinical management of COVID-19 is largely limited to infection prevention and supportive care.
So far, remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, is the only medication approved for emergency use to treat COVID-19 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Grein et al., 2020).
Although the evidence supporting remdesivir use in patients with advanced COVID-19 is promising, there remains an urgent need for potent SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents, especially those that could be given in an outpatient setting, to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
Quality control filtering of the data was performed, and two samples from each of the phosphorylation and protein abundance datasets were removed because of poor correlation with their respective replicates (Figures S1
A and S1B).
The downregulation of these proteins suggests that they may mechanistically contribute to symptoms of blood coagulation and stroke in COVID-19 patients (Han et al., 2020).
We detected 25 phosphorylation sites in SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that we combined with another proteomics dataset (Davidson et al., 2020) to amass a total of 49 sites detected across seven viral proteins (Table S2).
Dot color indicates whether the residue is (true) or is not (false) predicted to form part of an interaction interface based on SPPIDER analysis.
To identify phosphorylation sites that may regulate protein-protein interactions, all sites were mapped to 3D structures, and solvent accessibility based protein-protein interface identification and recognition (SPPIDER) was used to assess whether sites resided within interface regions (Porollo and Meller 2007; Figure 2A; Table S2).
Kinase activities were estimated for a wide-range of biological conditions obtained from previously published phosphoproteomics datasets (Ochoa et al., 2016).
To better understand the signaling states of cells over the course of infection, we compared our data with a compilation of public phosphoproteomics datasets of other conditions (Ochoa et al., 2016; Figures 4D and S2B).
Comparing phosphoproteomics profiles of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with a database of phosphorylation profiles collected at specific cell cycle stages, viral infection was most highly correlated with cells arrested at the S/G2 transition and was negatively correlated with profiles of cells in mitosis (Figure 6G).
Here, 68 total drugs and compounds were tested for antiviral efficacy (via qRT-PCR, anti-NP antibody, plaque assay, and/or TCID50) and cellular toxicity at two different institutions (in New York [Mount Sinai, 25 drugs/compounds] and Paris [Institut Pasteur, 62]) and in two cell lines (Vero E6 [68] and A549-ACE2 [61]).
Furthermore, silmitasertib is currently being considered for human testing as a potential treatment for COVID-19.
Recent immunological studies have indicated that increased IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α and lymphopenia are associated with severe COVID-19 cases (Pedersen and Ho 2020).
In contrast, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, p38/MAPK inhibition suppressed cytokine production and impaired viral replication by a still unknown mechanism, suggesting that p38/MAPK inhibition may target multiple mechanisms related to COVID-19 pathogenesis.
Silmitasertib, a small molecule undergoing clinical trials for various cancers, is now being considered for testing in humans to combat COVID-19.
The antiviral activity observed for gilteritinib, an FDA-approved drug for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, is supported by involvement of another AXL inhibitor, bencentinib, in the RECOVERY COVID-19 clinical trial in the United Kingdom.
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD019113 (Perez-Riverol et al., 2019).
For infection experiments in ACE2-A549 cells, SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281), which shares 99.983% sequence identity with the BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 isolate, was deposited by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH.
Raw mass spectrometry data from each DDA dataset were used to build separate libraries for DIA searches using the Pulsar search engine integrated into Spectronaut version 13.12.200217.43655 (Bruderer et al., 2015) by searching against a database of Uniprot Chlorocebus sequences (19,136 proteins, downloaded April 3, 2020) and 29 SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences translated from genomic sequence downloaded from GISAID (accession EPI_ISL_406596, downloaded April 7, 2020) with two mutations (G22661T Spike V367F and G26144T ORF3a G251V) detected by RNASeq analysis of virus stocks.
This complex dataset was reduced to a single fold change per site and time point by choosing (per time point) the fold change with the lowest p value, favoring those detected in both treatment and control, i.e., non-infinite log2 fold change values.
This single-site dataset, further reduced to those with human orthology (Table S1), was used as the input for kinase activity analysis.
Significance filters of adjusted p value < 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change (infected/mock) > 1 were applied to both phosphorylation and abundance datasets.
The resource comprises of a comprehensive collection of phosphosite annotations of direct substrates of kinases obtained from six databases, PhosphoSitePlus, SIGNOR, HPRD, NCI-PID, Reactome, and the BEL Large Corpus, and using three text-mining tools, REACH, Sparser, and RLIMS-P. Kinase activities were inferred as a -log10(p value) of Z-test from the comparison of fold changes in phosphosite measurements of the known substrates against the overall distribution of fold changes across the sample.
In addition to the time-course experiment, we also estimated kinase activities of cell line perturbation in a range of biological conditions using the K-test based approach, from a large resource of previously published phosphoproteomics datasets comprising of 435 biological conditions which include several drug treatments (chlorzoxazone, paclitaxel), inhibitors (EGFRi, AKTi) and cell cycle states (Ochoa et al., 2016).
Annotations for protein complexes were obtained from CORUM v3.0 database (Giurgiu et al., 2019).
To evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Transcription Factor (TF) level, we applied DoRothEA (Garcia-Alonso et al., 2019) to RNA-seq datasets of different human lung cell lines from a recent study (GSE147507) (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020).
For TCID50 and plaque assay results, which are not depicted in a percent scale, the IC50 values were extracted directly from the parameterized hill equation (see Figure S5 and Table S8).
The causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, highlighting an urgent need to develop antiviral therapies.
We found pharmacologic inhibition of the p38, CK2, CDK, AXL, and PIKFYVE kinases to possess antiviral efficacy, representing potential COVID-19 therapies.
