In late 2019, an outbreak of the novel ​Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread throughout the world (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020).
Based on the data shared by World Health Organization (WHO), as of June 25th, over nine million people have tested positive for COVID-19, with a mortality of over 480,000 people worldwide.
Therefore, early virus detection and isolation of COVID-19 ‘positive’ individuals are crucial to limit virus transmission and implementation of effective measures to control the spread of the virus and relieve the burden on the healthcare system (Jones et al., 2014; Isere et al., 2015).
However, these methods have some drawbacks, including low specificity, a high rate of false positives, and difficulty of adapting these techniques for effective POC diagnostics for pandemics such as COVID-19 (Chou et al., 2011; Nagai et al., 2016).
The positive samples had different Ct values ranging from 15 to 40 with the CDC qPCR N gene primer sets (IDT, Catalogue #10,006,606).
Various detection modules, including GeneXpert, Cephied, and ID NOW by Abbot are low throughput and require the use of a single machine for each sample, which may be impractical for low-resource environments and where large-scale testing in a short time window is needed.
Lateral flow cleavage reporter (​5′-​/56-FAM/TTATTATT/3Bio/​-3′​, IDT) was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 500 nM in 100 μL reaction volume along with the 2 μL RT-LAMP product, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C (62 °C for Cas12b) for 10–30 minutes.
The initial 50 μL of reaction mix contains the complete RT-LAMP reagents such as 5 μL 10X isothermal amplification buffer, 5 μL 10X Primer Mix, 4 μL of 100 mM MgSO4, 7 μL of 10 mM dNTP mix, 2 μL of Bst LF DNA polymerase (50 ng), and 2 μL of RTx reverse transciptase 4 ng/μl, together with 2.5 μL of 500 ng/μL salmon sperm DNA, 2 μL of viral (control or clinical sample) RNA, 5 μL of 5 μM specific (or non-specific) AacCas21b sgRNAs and 5 μL of 5 μM lateral flow cleavage reporter (​5′-​/56-FAM/TTATTATT/3Bio/​-3′​, IDT) and 5.5 μL nuclease-free water.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects all aspects of human life.
Our iSCAN SARS-CoV-2 detection module, which exhibits the critical features of a robust molecular diagnostic device, should facilitate the effective management and control of COVID-19.
