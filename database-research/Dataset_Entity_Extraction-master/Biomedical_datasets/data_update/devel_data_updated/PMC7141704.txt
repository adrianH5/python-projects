Previous reports indicated that the emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) had raised global concern and was characterized as a pandemic event by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.1, 2, 3 Till March 18, 2020, it has spread to 146 countries, including Taiwan.
People in Taiwan and mainland China travel frequently, which put Taiwan at a great risk of acquiring an epidemic of COVID-19.
Taiwan has been on constant alert and react rapidly to epidemics change from China ever since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and has done much effort on the containment of COVID-19 with success.
Till March 18, 2020, there are only 100 cases of COVID-19 noted in Taiwan, including 79 imported cases and 21 cases belonging to seven occasions of limited local transmission (six family clusters and two transmissions in social societies).
The most interesting point of this patient is where she contracted her COVID-19.
However, despite that the median incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.1 days, it might be as long as more than three weeks in some extreme cases.

The phylogenetic tree was generated and modified for display purposes from Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/ncov), which uses genetic sequences and metadata from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/CoV2020/) and sequence submission date for the horizontal axis.
To our best knowledge, in late February and early March, several foreignÂ COVID-19 patients who had travel histories to Egypt were reported.
Further phylogenetic analysis including viral sequences derived from the 45 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections on the quarantined Nile cruise boat will help to delineate the outbreak on Nile tourism boat and its impact on the COVID-19 epidemic.
