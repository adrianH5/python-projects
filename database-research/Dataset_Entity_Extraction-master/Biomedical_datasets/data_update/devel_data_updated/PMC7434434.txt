Overall, these data show the utility of genomics to complement other tools in the response to, and containment of, the COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 cases are slowly increasing in number in Africa and genetic mutations are expected to accumulate as the virus spreads.
As well as ongoing mobilisation of resources to support the COVID-19 outbreak response, it is crucial for Africa to develop sustainable approaches, with a vision to change the siloed pathogen-specific diagnostics methods and implement digital and genomic transformation in the public health system.
SENTINEL, a new international initiative led by the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) in Nigeria and the Broad Institute, is utilising ultra-sensitive genomic technologies to develop a pandemic pre-emption system that detects viral threats in real time.
