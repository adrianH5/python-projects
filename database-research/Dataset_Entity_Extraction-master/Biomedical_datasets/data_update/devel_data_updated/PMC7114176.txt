The rHCoVs-OC43 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) according to a previously described method (Reed, 1938).
Additionally, rOC43-ns2DelRluc (100 TCID50) showed pathogenicity in BALB/c mice, which exhibited neurological symptoms identical to those caused by the parental virus after intracerebral inoculation (Shen et al., 2016).
Therefore, these two mouse strains were infected with 104 TCID50 of rOC43-ns2DelRluc or HCoV-OC43-WT by intranasal inoculation in order to determine its infection of the respiratory tract in vivo.
However, in the present study, we found that both BALB/c or C57BL/6 suckling mice (<12-days old) infected with HCoV-OC43 at a dose of 104 TCID50 showed 100% mortality and similar sensitivity.
To confirm these observations and the dissemination of the recombinant virus, the viral load in different tissues was determined using an IFA in BHK-21â€¯cells or real-time qRT-PCR at 6 dpi via intranasal inoculation of 104 TCID50 of rOC43-ns2DelRluc.
To perform BLI of rOC43-ns2DelRluc in vivo, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with 104 TCID50 of rOC43-ns2DelRluc or HCoV-OC43-WT, monitored over time, and bioluminescence intensity was determined (Fig. 3
).
Briefly, individual BALB/c mice were either inoculated intracerebrally with 100 TCID50 or intranasally with 104 TCID50 of rOC43-ns2DelRluc and monitored over time.
Mice were intracerebrally infected with 100 TCID50 of rOC43-ns2DelRluc, and bioluminescence intensity was measured daily (Fig. 5
).
