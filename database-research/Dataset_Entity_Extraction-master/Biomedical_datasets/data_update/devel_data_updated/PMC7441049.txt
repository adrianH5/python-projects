All sequences are amplified, followed by classification of sequences based on a reference database.
However, detection and identification of novel, previously unknown emerging viruses presents a challenge due to the absence of their genome sequences in reference databases.
Identification of coronaviruses was tested using modified databases lacking SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, mimicking the situation at the time of virus discovery.
After quality pre-processing using an in-house QC pipeline, Biopet version 0.9.0 [17] and removal of human reads after mapping them to human reference genome GRCh38 [18] with Bowtie2 version 2.3.4 [19], the remaining sequencing reads were taxonomically classified using Centrifuge 1.0.2-beta [20] with the databases prepared by taking all 12,302 Refseq viral genomes (as of Juny 16th, 2020) and extracting the GenBank records annotated before the dates of the existence of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV index patients in 2012 and 2002, respectively.
All contigs were analyzed using the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST 2.8.1) [23] using the BLAST NCBIâ€™s nucleotide (nt) database (accessed April 2018).
After extraction of human reads, FASTQ files generated for SARS-CoV-2 samples (with and without viral enrichment) were uploaded for classification and de novo assembly by the commercial web-based tool Genome Detective v1.120 (www.genomedetective.com, accessed 2020-05-11) [9], using a reference database (generated 2019-09-21).
In brief, after removal of low-quality reads and trimming by Trimmomatic [24], candidate viral reads were identified using the protein-based alignment method DIAMOND [25] in combination with the Swissprot UniRef90 protein database followed by de novo assembly using metaSPAdes [26].
Blastx and Blastn [23] were used to search for candidate reference sequences using the NCBI RefSeq virus database (accessed 2019-09-21).
To mimic the classification conditions present in the setting of virus discovery, viral metagenomic reference genome databases created before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were used for the classification of sequence reads (December 2019 for the two SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, November 2002 for the SARS-CoV and June 2012 for the MERS-CoV positive samples).
GenomeDetective results of identification of SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a database created before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Fig. 2

In this study, we evaluated the performance of a metagenomic sequencing protocol for the identification of emerging viruses using clinical samples in combination with a simulated reference database.
The performance of a viral metagenomic protocol in a clinical setting for the identification of novel coronaviruses was tested using clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, in combination with databases generated to contain only viruses of before the discovery dates of these coronaviruses, to mimic virus discovery.
