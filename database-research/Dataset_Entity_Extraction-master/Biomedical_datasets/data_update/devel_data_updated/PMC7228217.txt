Thus, to better understand the emergence of the recent SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic in Italy, we analyzed a larger and updated dataset of recently released data of the COVID‐2019 epidemic to improve more effective intervention strategies.
The dataset comprised (n = 141) complete genomes sequences from the current (2019‐2020) SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic retrieved from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) database.
The complete dataset was assessed for the presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the IQ‐TREE 1.6.8 software (http://www.iqtree.org).
To better understand the establishment and transmission of the novel SARS‐CoV‐2 in Italy, the recent Italian genomes available on the GISAID database were added to a dataset of 138 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from the global epidemic.
Phylogenetic inference robustness will be improved if other genomic sequences will be available to build an even more informative dataset despite the low heterogeneity of the sequenced strains.
