As of August 5, 2020, 18,566,769 persons with COVID-19 infection were reported in 188 countries and territories worldwide and resulting in 701,316 death [3].
This COVID-19 pandemic not just a global health crisis, but also affect the global economy system.
Therefore, Taiwan government took very quick reaction to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Taiwan according to the previous experience dealing with SARS.
Taiwan still has a low incidence and very low death rate of COVID-19 compared with Europe and USA [5].
But the situation of COVID-19 infection in the United States are still in the peak by mid-April, 2020.
How to treat and prevent COVID-19 infection becomes the most important global health issues.
The governments of big countries, the big pharmaceutical companies, the major scientific laboratories all have made big investment for the treatment of COVID-19 currently.
Since Taiwan has many academic institutes and industries good in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields, it is a very good time point for Taiwan to develop quick diagnosis kits, new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 infection.
Therefore, after Taiwan start to have COVID-19 patients in January, 2020, the Minister of Health and Welfare requested National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) to take the responsibility in coordinating the research in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan.
To collect the COVID-19 biosamples in accordance with the Human Biobank Management Act [6].
The Ethic Committee of NHRI Biobank quickly designed and approved a new non-tumor informed consent form (ICF) for COVID-19 patients on Feb. 13.
For recruitment of COVID-19 patients and collect specimen from all hospitals in Taiwan, we need to have a connection with all major hospitals, since we did not know COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in which hospitals.
On Feb.27, The Department of Medical Affairs of MOHW forward the official letter of NBCT to all hospitals at or above the regional level in Taiwan urging all medical institutes to collaborate for collection of biosamples of COVID-19 patients and to accelerate the research of COVID-19.
On March 1, we received the first COVID-19 patient blood samples immediately.
We also quickly received the first application for COVID-19 serum samples on March 17 and got approved in April.
NHRI President Liang rapidly approved the usage of a new laboratory exclusively for NHRI Biobank to store and handling the COVID-19 biosamples.
In addition, it also needs to have a biosafety cabinet (BSC) for handling the COVID-19 biosamples.
For opening this P2 lab, and to handle the COVID-19 human biosamples, we need to apply for the permission of NHRI Biosafty Committee.
This special P2 laboratory was completely set up and got permission to work in 2 weeks, just before we received the first COVID-19 human samples on March 1, 2020.
Since COVID-19 patients in Taiwan was few (only 32 cases reported when the P2 laboratory was established), and these patients distributed diversely across Taiwan.
This NHRI COVID-19 Biobank will also conduct value-added analyses of the collected blood samples, including DNA whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing.
By August 5, 2020, this COVID-19 biobank has collected 165 blood samples of 110 patients from more than 10 hospitals across north, middle and south part of Taiwan, including both COVID-19 (+) and (−) pneumonia patients.
However, since Taiwan already have reported 476 COVI-19 cases as of August 5, 2020 [5], the current recruitment of COVID-19 patients is still not satisfactory.
We are very grateful for the doctors and the medical personnel who spent the time and effort to help collect the specimens and all of the patients who are willing to donate their blood samples for COVID-19 research.
By the request of the Minister of Health and Welfare, NHRI Biobank was assigned to establish a COVID-19 biobank in early Feb, 2020 to collect COVID-19 patients’ blood samples for Taiwan researchers and industries in an emergent way.
By August 5, 2020, this COVID-19 biobank has collected 165 blood samples of 110 patients from more than 10 hospitals across north, middle and south part of Taiwan, including both COVID-19 (+) and (-) pneumonia patients.
This biobank can provide applicants with biosamples, such as serum, DNA and RNA, and also the clinical and genomic data, so as to accelerate the COVID-19 treatment and prevention research in Taiwan.
This COID-19 biobank already received 15 applications.
It has become the most important research resource for the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan, including new screening reagents, disease mechanism, the variable human responses and epidemic preventions.
