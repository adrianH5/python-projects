In the U. S and UK, the COVID Symptom tracker app developed with the Coronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology Consortium (COPE) is being widely used to track COVID-related exposure and infections. [12]
Our current project aims to provide a systematic review of the literature on mobile applications with multiple function including: information dissemination (ID), ID with symptom checking (SSC), contact tracing alone, SSC, training health care workers, disinfection checklist, and service Apps around COVID-19.
Our systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD 42020180878), consisted of a mixed methods study where we provide an overview of smartphone applications designed for COVID-19 through both a literature search as well as a search of mobile platforms for applications.
We limited our search to applications released or updated for COVID-19 till May 5th, 2020 and screened these applications for their title, description of the application on mobile platforms, its functions around COVID-19 and then completed a comprehensive assessment of these mobile applications (Fig. 1a).
Due to rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and language restrictions, we limited our search to the United States, United Kingdom and India.
A systematic search was conducted on PubMed (Medline), Cochrane central register for controlled trials, Google Scholar and Turning Research Into Practice medical database from 9-10th of May 2020 to identify peer-reviewed publications and grey literature on the utility of smartphone applications in the Covid-19 pandemic and help aid our ongoing assessment of mobile platforms. [16]
Apps were classified based on their key functions- ID (n = 18), ID with tracking of individuals (n = 9), or ID with SSC (n = 15), contact tracing alone (n = 8), SSC (n = 7), training of healthcare workers (n = 3), disinfection checklist (n = 1), and service apps [Delivery or fund-raising] (n = 2).
The most downloaded and reviewed app on the Google play store (GPS) was Aarogya Setu developed by the Government of India (50,000,000+ downloads and 343,842 reviews), with a government mandate for download by all Indians especially those who travel or are diagnosed with COVID-19, with a GPS star rating of 4.6 out of 5 (Supplementary Table 2).
In addition to providing self-screening technology, it displays alerts of COVID-19 patients diagnosed within a 500 m, 1, 2, 5, and 10-km radius of the user which is a useful tool to understand the disease load in the proximity of an individual.
For example, those articles which focused on specialty practice during COVID-19 and telemedicine, smartphone enabled technology that did not involve an application, or studies that utilized apps to assess for mental health outcomes among COVID-19 patients.
The more descriptive studies reviewed the evidence of the utility of smartphone apps for COVID-19 based on countries’ experiences (Table 2).
Only one application included in our study, The COVID-19 Symptom Tracker mobile application, conducted an observational study to provide scientific evidence of the app’s utility.
Important results in their study demonstrated that the app could predict in advance the COVID-19 incidence of a region. [17]
Further, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of all mobile applications across three regions which are currently experiencing rapidly rising burden of COVID-19 related cases and deaths and hence, identifying the key scientific features of mobile applications that should be used in design and engagement remains very crucial to sustained public health efforts aimed at mitigating this disaster.
The global impact of COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid development and utilization of mobile health applications.
Here we provide an overview of mobile applications being currently utilized for COVID-19 and their assessment using the Mobile Application Rating Scale.
We performed a systematic review of the literature and mobile platforms to assess mobile applications currently utilized for COVID-19, and a quality assessment of these applications using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) for overall quality, Engagement, Functionality, Aesthetics, and Information.
Our search identified 63 apps that are currently being used for COVID-19.
18 apps were developed for sharing up to date information on COVID-19, and 8 were used for contact tracing while 9 apps showed features of both.
