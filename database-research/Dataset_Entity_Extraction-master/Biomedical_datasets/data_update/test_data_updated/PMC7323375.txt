The present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a pandemic respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS CoV‐2.
Furthermore, in order to estimate the evolutionary progression of the bat SARS CoV genome, such that it is able to adapt to a human host as a novel coronavirus causing COVID‐19, we have analyzed the complete genomes of the bat, civet, human SARS CoV, and human SARS CoV‐2.
The spike proteins were retrieved from the NCBI database using the sequence similarity search BLAST program,
 with human SARS CoV‐2 spike protein as the query sequence (NCBI code: QHD43416) from the genome (GenBank code: MN908947.3).
The complete genome nucleotide sequences of SARS CoV from bats, civets, and SARS CoV and CoV‐2 from human host were obtained from NCBI virus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide) in FASTA format.
The redundancy in each data set was removed using the CD‐HIT program.
In the NGPhylogeny server, we have selected FastME 2.0 program that infers phylogenies using a distance approach since it is capable of handling large data sets.
Abstract  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS CoV‐2).
