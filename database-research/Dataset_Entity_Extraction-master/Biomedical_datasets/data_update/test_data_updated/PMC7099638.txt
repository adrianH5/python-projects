The dataset comprised all currently available (n = 29) full genome sequences from the current (2019–2020) nCoV epidemic, as well as closely related (n = 2) bat strains (SARS-like CoV) retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) databases.
The complete dataset was assessed for presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the IQ-TREE 1.6.8 software (http://www.iqtree.org) [8].
Both SS and PS estimators indicated the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock (Bayes Factor = 4.3) as the best fitted model to the dataset under analysis.
