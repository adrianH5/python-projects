SARS CoV‐2, the virus which causes COVID19, is similar to, but not identical with the SARS‐CoV‐1 virus, which caused the SARS epidemic originating in China in 2002 to 2003.
For example, analyses of different strains showed that predominance of COVID‐19 cases in the New York City area resulted largely from infected patients who flew in from Europe, rather than Asia.
Consequently, barring US entry to recent visitors to China on January 31st, and from European countries on March 11th was largely ineffective in preventing the COVID outbreak in the United States.
The impact of the COVID‐19 epidemic suggests that interest in the development of a vaccine will be more enduring.
The COVID‐19 epidemic was not the first coronavirus epidemic of this century and represents one of the increasing number of zoonoses from wildlife to impact global health.
SARS CoV‐2, the virus causing the COVID‐19 epidemic is distinct from, but closely resembles SARS CoV‐1, which was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002.
We review recent coronavirus‐related epidemics and distinguish clinical and molecular features of CoV‐2, the causative agent for COVID‐19, and review the current status of vaccine trials.
