Some publications have reported highest risk of severe complications of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) in cancer patients.
To date, quarantine is the only recommended preventive attitude against COVID‐19.
High proportion of asymptomatic patients, the absence of validated serological testing and the limitations of systematic mass testing by reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), hamper the control of COVID‐19 outbreak.
We report a strategy of systematic detection of COVID‐19 symptoms with patient‐reported questionnaire in cancer patients.
We estimated the incidence rate of COVID‐19 among cancer patients at 1.5%, consistently with previous results.
This might be underestimated due to asymptomatic forms of COVID‐19, low specificity of COVID‐19 symptoms in context of malignancies and false‐negative results of RT‐PCR assay.
One of limitation in our study is the lack of screening of digestive symptoms, potentially compatible with COVID‐19.
Most of screened patients were not male (75.7%) and had no comorbidity (55.6%), factors predisposing to COVID‐19 and severe forms.
Finally, we excluded patients with thoracic and hematological malignancies, also at risk of COVID‐19 and severe events.
Nine patients were diagnosed with COVID‐19 and none developed severe form, contrary to other studies including mostly cancer survivors or lung cancer patients.

 Given the absence of severe form of COVID‐19, we did not study biological prognostic factors, probably poorly specific in cancer patients.
Large‐scale data are needed to further explore risk factors of COVID‐19 severity in this population.
