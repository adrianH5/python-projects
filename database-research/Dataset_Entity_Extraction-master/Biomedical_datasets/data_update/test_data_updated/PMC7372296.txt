As of May 23, 2020, over 5100,000 confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 330,000 deaths were reported globally [3], with over 200 countries impacted [4], [5], [6], [7].
ACE2 has also been shown recently as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in virological studies or bioinformatic analyses (PMID: 32015508, 32142651) [9].
The S gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (GISAID, No. EPI_ISL_402119) and SARS-CoV (GenBank No. AY278489.2) were codon-optimized for expression in human cells.
SARS-CoV-2 was added to the cells (200 50% tissue culture infective dose, TCID50).
The Ct value of the measured sample was analyzed with the standard curve to calculate the corresponding TCID50 value of the sample.
To test whether hACE2 is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we infected Vero cells with 50 TCID50 of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence of various concentrations of recombinant ACE2, as a soluble form of ACE2-Fc [14].
Vaccines inducing broad and sustained immunity could offer effective protection against infectious diseases such as COVID-19 [19,20].
Unfortunately, there are currently no approved vaccines available against any human coronavirus, despite the huge medical, social and economic impacts imposed by the SARS, MERS, and the COVID-19 pandemics.
Developing a vaccine, ideally a universal prophylactic effective against coronaviruses, will be extremely useful for combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as future outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV variants and possibly other coronaviruses.
