To discover BGCs encoding members of the FK506/rapamycin structural class (FK gene clusters), we developed a biosynthetic “search term” to query our microbial sequence database containing partial sequences of pooled DNA samples from ∼135,000 Actinomycete species.
Pipecolate is incorporated in the final and shared step of FK506 and rapamycin assembly-line biosynthesis (19, 20) and directly binds the FKBP active site.
Once we identified genetic matches to the search term in our fragmentary sequence database, we identified the candidate Actinomycete strains harboring putative FK gene clusters.
In addition to CEP250, 11 other targets were identified in the proteomic target-identification (ID) screen of FKBP12–WDB002, albeit less reproducibly and with significantly lower spectral counts than CEP250 (Fig. 2), suggesting that they either bind weakly to FKBP12:WDB002, or they are associated with the complex containing CEP250.
We report the structure of CEP25011.4 bound to FKBP12 in the presence of WDB002 (Fig. 3, Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 6OQA).
In a recent cellular protein interactome screen for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 disease, CEP250 was identified as a host factor that is engaged by the viral Nsp13 protein (42), suggesting the possibility that WDB002 may carry inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 by binding to CEP250.
Finally, since WDB002 targets CEP250, it may be a promising starting point for developing a treatment for COVID-19.
As CEP250 was recently found to be an interaction partner with the Nsp13 protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease, it is possible that WDB002 or an analog may exert useful antiviral activity through its ability to form high-affinity ternary complexes containing CEP250 and FKBP12.
