The availability of the virus genome sequence (GenBank ID: MN908947.3) makes it possible to identify treatments.
However, 2019‐nCoV shares 82 % sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus (SARS‐CoV, GenBank ID: NC_004718.3) and more than 90 % sequence identity in several essential enzymes (see figures below).
Both crystal and cryo‐EM structures of the SARS‐CoV spike‐ACE2 complex (PDB IDs: 2AJF and 6ACD) have showed that only regions 1 and 2 engage in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with ACE2.
33 Exonuclease activity by the enzyme nsp14 has been shown to be able to remove mismatches as well as incorporated nucleoside analogues, and inactivation of nsp14′s exonuclease activity has been shown to increase the efficacy of nucleosides like RBV.32, 34 In order to develop nucleoside analogues to effectively inhibit viral RNA replication, the nucleoside must either evade detection by the exonuclease or must outcompete exonuclease activity.
