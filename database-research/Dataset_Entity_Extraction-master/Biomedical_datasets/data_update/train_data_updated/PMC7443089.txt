In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) was identified in Wuhan, China (Li et al., 2020) and named COVID-19 by WHO.
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) has surprisingly caught the global community as of August 10, 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases going to reach twenty million (20,055,196) with over seven hundred thousands (734,536) deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). .
Currently, there are no effective medications against COVID-19/SARS-CoV2 although several research groups throughout the world are working to develop the vaccine.
Drug repositioning or reprofiling is a promising strategy to conquer the battle against COVID-19 in a time-critical manner.
Zhou et al (2020) confirmed that SARS-CoV2 uses the same receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV, after isolating the BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) of a COVID-19 patients.et alIn the war against corona, scientists are working on following possible therapeutics measures: one is against the human cell to prevent virus entry or block the signaling pathways required for viral infection and other therapeutics against the virus itself by preventing the virus replication (non-structural proteins) and self-assembly (structural proteins).
Chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug has been shown to have antiviral activity at entry and post-entry stages of the COVID-19 infection (Gao et al., 2020).
In February 2020 Thailand health ministry announced marked progress in COVID-19 treatment with successful use of a cocktail (combined anti-flu drug oseltamivir with anti-HIV lopinavir and ritonavir) against coronavirus (https://www.dawn.com/news/1532081).
The 3-dimensional structure of the ACE2 (PDB ID:1R4L), SARS-CoV2 spike ectodomain structure (PDB ID:6vyB) and RdRp (PDB ID:6M71) were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000).
The structure of the ligand; remdesivir (CID: 121304016), favipiravir (CID: 492405), chloroquine (CID: 83818) and SSAA09E2 (CID: 2738575) were retrieved from the PubChem database (https://pusbchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
To find the appropriate binding orientations of the ligand dataset with the respective target automated dockings were performed using AutoDock 4.2 (Norgan et al., 2011) tool following standard protocol.
Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies of attractive drug targets of COVID-19 illness, spike protein, RdRp enzyme (Nsp12) and human receptor ACE2 enzyme in the apo and bound state were performed to assess the folding, stability, conformational changes and dynamic behaviors of all the systems.
The strong interaction of both remdesivir and favipiravir with RdRp of SARS-CoV2 suggests a worthy option to treat COVID-19 disease with these existing antiviral medicines.
Thus, RdRp could be an attractive target to stop the COVID-19 illness caused by SARS-CoV2.
The outbreak of this COVID-19 epidemic, triggered the researchers all over the world to explore drugs for potential therapeutics of this SARS-CoV2-induced respiratory disease.
Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19 in China and all across the world; some promising results was achieved in March 2020 and anti-malarial drug chloroquine was confirmed as an active drug in treating coronavirus and  has approved it on March 28, 2020 (Wang et al., 2020).
an the On June 5, 2020 the investigators from United kingdom recovery trial announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine do not prove promising to reduce the mortality rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and results were supported by another solidarity trial, the french discovery trial (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020).
remdesivir and ravipiravir, are just approved for a clinical trial as a drug to treat COVID-19 (Maxmen, 2020).
Although promising results were observed with remdesivir and favipiravir and many pharmaceutical companies are launching generic names for these drugs as COVID-19 treatment but to date, we are lacking sufficient pieces of evidence to call any drug as “game-changer”.
Similarly, binding of these inhibitors with the ACE2 receptor protein is of significant interest and it is speculated based on these results that virus entry could be stopped by blocking the viral host interaction to cure this COVID-19 illness (Fig. 6
A and B).
Likewise, our results support the computational (Wuet al, 2020) and muticlinical studies (Maxmen, 2020) conducted to find potential therapeutics measures in the war against COVID-19.
The rapid breakout of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared pandemic with serious global concern due to high morbidity and mortality.
As we enter the phase beyond limitations there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against COVID-19.
A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against COVID-19.
Thus, drug repurposition is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost to treat COVID-19, we don't have enough time as the whole world is lockdown and we are in urgent need of an obvious therapeutics' measures.
