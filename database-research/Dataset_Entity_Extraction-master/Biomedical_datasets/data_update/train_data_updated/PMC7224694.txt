The COVID-19 pandemic has made brutally clear the need for further research into many aspects of viruses.
To assess the concentration of infectious viruses, researchers typically measure the '50% tissue-culture infectious dose' (TCID50).
Measuring TCID50 involves infecting replicate cultures of susceptible cells with dilutions of the virus and noting the dilution at which half the replicate dishes become infected.
Viral counts reported by TCID50 tend to be much lower than RT-qPCR measurements, which could be one reason why studies relying on RNA measurements (Moriarty et al., 2020) report the persistence of viral RNA on surfaces for much longer times than studies relying on TCID50 (van Doremalen et al., 2020).
For the common cold, for example, ~0.1 TCID50 are sufficient to infect half of the people exposed (Couch et al., 1966).
At the time of writing, such assays are not widely available, and so researchers resort to surrogate datasets generated by testing of foreign citizens returning home from infected countries (Verity et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020), large-scale semi-random testing in countries such as Iceland, near complete testing of passengers on the Diamond Princess ship (Russell et al., 2020), or epidemiological models estimating the number of undocumented cases (Li et al., 2020a; Mizumoto et al., 2020).
(Godet et al., 1992): "Based on the estimated molar ratio and assuming that coronavirions bear 100 (J Gen Virol
63: 241–245) to 200 spikes, each composed of 3 s molecules (Virus Research
20:107–120) it can be inferred that approximately 15–30 copies of ORF4 protein are incorporated into TGEV virions (Purdue strain)."
The COVID-19 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics is often a story about the numbers.
