However, the role and timing of tracheostomy for patients requiring critical care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear.
Early guidelines from both the UK and national bodies proposed a cautious approach to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19â€”avoiding before 10 days of intubation and giving serious consideration before performing at all between 10 and 21 days after intubation, allowing for a sufficient decline in viral load.
With a dedicated 24 h on call tracheostomy service competent in percutaneous and surgical techniques, and access to dedicated COVID emergency theatres, the choice of performing a surgical or percutaneous tracheostomy depended only on patient body habitus, adequate neck extension, and grade of direct laryngoscopy.
COVID-19-related laryngeal oedema, and upper airway oedema from prone-positioning also increased the risk of failure of extubation.
These factors all guided a more interventionalist approach adopted by our COVID-19 airway team.
In the absence of an evidence base, many guidelines based on expert opinion were published referencing the role of tracheostomy in COVID-19.
Later guidelines from an expert working group adopted a more moderate stance and the results of this study provide support for this approach.

 Tracheostomy timing in COVID-19 patients should take into consideration the safety and ideal timing for patient outcomes, and the safety of healthcare personnel performing the tracheostomy.

However, tracheostomy occurred in both trial arms much earlier after intubation than is recommended in the COVID-19 setting.
Among the tracheostomy team, none of the clinicians developed COVID-19 symptoms during the study period and subsequent antibody testing at 2 weeks after the study period was negative in all but one surgeon, who developed COVID-19 before commencing on the team.
In addition, none of the SLT or ODP team members involved developed COVID-19 symptoms.
Our experience in a much larger cohort supports the assertion that tracheostomy can be performed with low risk to COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers.
Prolonged continuous sedation requirements are a recognised feature of ventilated COVID-19 patients.
The role of tracheostomy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear, with several consensus guidelines advising against this practice.
We developed both a dedicated airway team and coordinated education programme to facilitate ward management of tracheostomised COVID-19 patients.
Here, we report outcomes in the first 100 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at our institution.
This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients confirmed to have COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK.
Secondary outcomes included duration of ventilation, ICU stay, and healthcare workers directly involved in tracheostomy care acquiring COVID-19.
Results  A total of 164 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU between March 9, 2020 and April 21, 2020.
No healthcare workers developed COVID-19.
Conclusion  Independent of the severity of critical illness from COVID-19, 30-day survival was higher and ICU stay shorter in patients receiving tracheostomy.
Early tracheostomy appears to be safe in COVID-19.
