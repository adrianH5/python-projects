The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, China from December 2019, and has been spread out to the world [1, 2].
This case report describes the symptoms, diagnosis and treatments of one unconventional COVID-19 pneumonia case in our hospital during early period of the outbreak when having very little understanding on the virus and the infection.
However, COVID-19 ribonucleic acid test was negative using nasopharyngeal swabs done by Shenzhen Center for Disease Control (Shenzhen CDC).
According to the seventh edition of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP) treatment plan issued by National Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, this patient in the case report is considered as a severely ill case of the COVID-19 pneumonia.
As reported by Dr. Yang Yang and his group, the nucleic acid of SARS-COV-2 could be detected from BALF samples of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia while not from the upper respiratory tract specimens of some patients [10].
Our report highlights the importance to carry out bronchoscopy and detection of SARS-COV-2 RNA from BALF samples as complementary interventions in addition to monitoring epidemiological changes, clinical symptoms and chest CT findings of the unconventional COVID-19 pneumonia cases like the one described in this report, which will be informative and clinically significant in guiding the prognosis of the disease.
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China since Dec 2019 and cases of infection have been continuously reported in various countries.
Nucleic acid detection is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
