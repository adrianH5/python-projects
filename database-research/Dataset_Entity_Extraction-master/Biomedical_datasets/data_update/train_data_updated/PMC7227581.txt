To analyse the phylogenetic relationship between different coronaviruses, 591 genomes were downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Database (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/).
To prevent anomaly in the data represented, complete genomes and only high coverage datasets were utilized.
We investigated the phylogenetic analysis of 591 genomic sequences of hCoV obtained from GISAID database using RAxML methods.
