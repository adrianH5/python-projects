With respect to the origin of this COVID-19 pandemic, of further interest is the fact that the S protein has a specific FCS that is absent in coronaviruses of the same clade as SARS-CoV-2 [8,[14], [15], [16]].
In the midst of this COVID-19 pandemic, FCS is reportedly linked to a natural-selection, instead of purposeful-manipulation, −based hypothesis of the origin of this COVID-19 outbreak [9,[17], [18], [19], [20], [21]].
Regardless of this COVID-19-origin hypothesis [9], to date (Thu Jun 25 09:39:392020), it still remains not clear what the actual structural consequence is of the polybasic FCS's insertion into the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.
In fact, however, the structural search led to a Cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 6VSB) with a range of EUTs [24], representing the three-dimensional structure of the prefusion 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein with a single receptor-binding domain up [1].
From an amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 1.2 in supplementary file supplement.pdf), it is obvious that those EUTs are widely scattered throughout the homotrimeric structure (PDB ID 6VSB) [1].
Yet, with another amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 1.1 in supplementary file supplement.pdf), it was revealed that the sequence similarity between the Cryo-EM structure (PDB ID 6VSB) and QHD43416.1 is as high as 99.26%, making PDB ID 6VSB rather suitable to be used as a structural template for the subsequent homology structural modelling of the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, the Cryo-EM PDB ID 6VSB structure was used as the template by the SwissModel [23] homology modelling server to build a structural model with as less EUTs [24] as possible of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.
With SwissModel [23] and UCSF Chimera [25], a homology homotrimeric structural model (supplementary file model.pdb) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was built with only two EUTs (Fig. 1.3 in supplementary file supplement.pdf) [24], one at its N-terminal and another at its C-terminal, as compared (Fig. 1.2 in supplementary file supplement.pdf) with the widely scattered EUTs [24] inside its Cryo-EM structural template PDB ID 6VSB [1].
In this figure, the three (A, B and C) chains of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is shown as green, cyan and purple cartoons, the residue naming scheme is Chain ID, residue name, residue number, the four salt bridges are shown here with four dotted yellow lines, with the lengths of the four inter-chain salt bridges being 2.6, 2.6, 3.3 and 3.5 Å, respectively.
Incorporating currently available structural data (as of Thu Jun 25 09:39:402020) of the S protein [22], and in the hope of pushing a little bit forward the boundary of our scientific knowledge on COVID-19, this short article presents a comprehensive structural characterization of the FCS inserted into the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and puts forward a set of structural analysis as below,
the polybasic FCS is spatially located at a random coil loop region, mostly distantly solvent-exposed (Fig. 1, instead of deeply buried), with no structural proximity to the other part of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.
the S1 and S2 subunits of the S protein will still be strongly bonded together, at least electrostatically [31] from a structural and biophysical point of view, even if the FCS is actually cleaved by furin protease.
Nevertheless, in the midst of this COVID-19 pandemic [32] with more than 5.5 million (as of Thu Jun 25 09:39:402020) confirmed cases globally, this short article puts forward a set of analysis that the net structural consequence of FCS here is the insertion of a furin cleavage site into the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and is thus of only limited structural biophysical relevance here.
