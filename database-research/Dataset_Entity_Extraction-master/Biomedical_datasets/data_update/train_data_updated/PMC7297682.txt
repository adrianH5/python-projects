It has been reported that in severe cases of COVID-19, hypoxaemia is induced by the pneumonic process and might have several adverse effects in patients (Rello et al., 2020).
Therefore, in prolonged hypoxia induction via COVID-19, the UPR is triggered to help the cells to survive.
However, prolonged hypoxia would possibly drive UPR role from survival to death and apoptotic mode, which possibly is one of the causes of cellular and organ damage in COVID-19 cases.
Usage of Zinc and Zinc ionophores may enhance the therapeutic effects of targeting autophagy and replication in COVID-19 by several compounds which along pyrithione include dithiocarbamates, disulfiram and quinoline derivatives such as clioquinol.
The pathologic source of this disease was a new RNA virus from Coronaviridae family, which was named COVID-19.
