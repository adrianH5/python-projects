Briefly, reads containing adaptor sequences and low-complex regions were removed from the dataset.
All non-human and non-repeat sequence reads were then compared to a reference virus database (downloaded from https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/ref_viruses_rep_genomes.tar.gz) and the non-redundant protein database (nr) using blastn and diamond blastx programs [4], respectively.
Taxonomy lineage information was obtained for each blast hits by matching the accession number with the taxonomy database, which was subsequently used to identify reads of virus origin.
The entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into β-coronavirus genus.
