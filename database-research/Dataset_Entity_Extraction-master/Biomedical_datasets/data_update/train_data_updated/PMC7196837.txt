Since December 2019, a pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO), emerged in Wuhan, China (1–3).
Although remdesivir was reported to possess potential antiviral effect in one COVID-19 patient from the United States, randomized controlled trials of this drug are ongoing to determine its safety and efficacy (6).
Moreover, the corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19 lung injury remains controversial, due to delayed clearance of viral infection and complications (7, 8).
Since the effective vaccine and specific antiviral medicines are unavailable, it is an urgent need to look for an alternative strategy for COVID-19 treatment, especially among severe patients.
Since the virological and clinical characteristics share similarity among SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 (15), CP therapy might be a promising treatment option for COVID-19 rescue (16).
Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 with a high neutralizing antibody titer may be a valuable donor source of CP.
Nevertheless, the potential clinical benefit and risk of convalescent blood products in COVID-19 remains uncertain.
Hence, we performed this pilot study in three participating hospitals to explore the feasibility of CP treatment in 10 severe COVID-19 patients.
Among the first batch of CP samples from 40 recovered COVID-19 patients, 39 showed high antibody titers of at least 1:160, whereas only one had an antibody titer of 1:32.
From January 23, 2020, to February 19, 2020, 10 severe COVID-19 patients (six males and four females) were enrolled and received CP transfusion.
Lymphocytopenia, an important index for prognosis in COVID-19 (2), tended to be improved after CP transfusion (median: 0.65 × 109 per L vs. 0.76 × 109 per L), 7 out of 10 patients showing an increase of lymphocyte counts (Fig. 2).
Recent studies on COVID-19 demonstrated that the lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood were remarkably decreased and the levels of cytokines in the plasma from patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) support, including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-ɑ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, were significantly higher than in those who did not require ICU conditions (2, 18).
CP, obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients who had established humoral immunity against the virus, contains a large quantity of neutralizing antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and eradicating the pathogen from blood circulation and pulmonary tissues (19).
Based on our preliminary results, CP therapy can be an easily accessible, promising, and safe rescue option for severe COVID-19 patients.
In the present study, recently recovered COVID-19 patients, who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 with neutralizing antibody titer above 1:640 and recruited from local hospitals, should be considered as suitable donors.
The antibody titers in CP in COVID-19 seem thus higher than those used in the treatment of MERS patient (1:80) (12).
All patients were diagnosed as having severe COVID-19 according to the WHO Interim Guidance (30) and the Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 of National Health Commission of China (version 5.0) (31), with confirmation by real-time RT-PCR assay.
Significance  COVID-19 is currently a big threat to global health.
These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19, while the randomized trial is warranted.
Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases.
