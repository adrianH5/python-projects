Presently, more than 350 sequences of virus isolated from several countries are shared in GISAID database.
All the 351 sequences available of COVID-19 isolated from humans have been downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) databank.
A dataset has been built including sequences from human and excluding sequences from animals (like bat or pangolin).
The complete dataset was assessed for presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the IQ-TREE 1.6.8 software (http://www.iqtree.org).
A comparison of data from evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis leads us to hypothesize that the mutations are probably unrelated to a strain or a sub-family of the COVID-19 but are due to independent converging evolution of the virus that promote these changes in the viral genome.
