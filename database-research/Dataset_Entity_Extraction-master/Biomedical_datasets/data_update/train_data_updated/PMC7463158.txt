We also examined how many seropositive children had received RT-PCR viral tests for COVID-19.
Over a third of children in our study had received at least one viral test (Table 1; note that administration of a viral test does not imply that a child was suspected of having COVID-19, since tests were routinely administered before hospital admission or procedures such as surgery).
A detailed chart review revealed that only the two seropositive children with a RT-PCR-confirmed viral infection had documented COVID-19 symptoms (Supplementary Table 1).
Additional RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pediatric cases were actively recruited to enroll in another approved study at Seattle Children’s Hospital during this study period.
Children are strikingly underrepresented in COVID-19 case counts.
Most seropositive children (6/8) were not suspected of having had COVID-19.
COVID-19 disease is less common in children than adults, but the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infections are missed through symptom-driven testing is not well understood.
In this study, the authors show that approximately 1% of children seeking care for reasons other than COVID-19 at a Seattle hospital in March/April 2020 were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2.
Full raw data for all serological assays, as well as much demographic and viral-testing data that can be provided without compromising sample and patient de-identification, are available in Supplementary Data files 1–4.
