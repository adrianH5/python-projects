The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease COVID-19, short for “coronavirus disease 2019”.
As of 27 May 2020, the WHO reported a total of 5 488 825 COVID-19 cases and 349 095 deaths globally [3], which brought a great challenge to public health worldwide.
Its genome sequence has been released and reported by Chinese scientists and submitted to the GenBank database on 12 January 2020 [5].
Protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the NCBI database (YP_009724390, YP_009724397).
Prediction of discontinuous epitopes on spike protein (PDB ID: 6VSB chain B) was conducted via DiscoTope 2.0 server [19].
This method is based on surface accessibility, residue statistics, and spatial information in a compiled data set of discontinuous epitopes discovered by X-ray crystallography of antigen/antibody complex structure.
All protein sequences were downloaded from NCBI database with accession IDs shown in Fig. 2a.
These peptides were scanned on the IEDB database.
The genome sequence and protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.
