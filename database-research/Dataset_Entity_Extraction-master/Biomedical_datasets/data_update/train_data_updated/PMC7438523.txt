The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is a sparking challenge for the entire world, and climate change may also affect the emergence of this novel coronavirus.
The recent emerging evidences suggested that the transmission of COVID-19 is associated with weather conditions, with dry and cold conditions appeared to boost the spreading of the infections.
Moreover, the per day mortality rate of COVID-19 is positively associated with diurnal temperature range (DTR) but negatively with relative humidity.
Therefore, this study has targeted the genome-wide mutational spectra covering nucleotide, aa and deletion mutations in 2,492 complete (and/or near complete) genomes of SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) up to 30 March 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1a).
Nucleotide (nt) sequence alignment revealed a total of 1,516 mutations (synonymous vs nonsynonymous ratio = 2.5:1) across the entire set of genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to the NCBI reference strain, Wuhan-Hu-1 (Accession NC_045512).
To our knowledge and based on this dataset, the 24-nt deletion (G32:L39) is only found in Japanese strain.
Also, the high morbidity and mortality of immune-compromised patients infected by COVID-19 might be correlated with the disastrous consequences of these mutations.
Further phylogenic study targeting those unique mutations may guide to proper global phylodynamics of the virus and modulate the regional control strategy against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Temperate European countries such as Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands and England are major COVID-19 infected countries with higher mortality rates at this initial stage.
Regardless of the importance of geography on the COVID-19 epidemiology, the effects of global mobility upon the genetic diversity and molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 are underappreciated and only beginning to be comprehended.
Moreover, the recent monograph on the spatial epidemiology of COVID-19 makes no reference to the genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2.
To decipher the genetic variations, we retrieved two thousand four hundred and ninety-two (n = 2,492) complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 available at the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) up to 30 March 2020.
To estimate the case fatality (mortality) rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we collected information on total infected cases, and total reported deaths in these countries from the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Reports up to March 30, 2020.
We aligned the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences using MAFFT online server using default parameters, and the complete genome sequence SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Accession NC_045512, Version NC_045512.2) was used as a reference genome.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel evolutionary divergent RNA virus, is responsible for the present devastating COVID-19 pandemic.
To explore the genomic signatures, we comprehensively analyzed 2,492 complete and/or near-complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from across the globe to the GISAID database up to 30 March 2020.
We used the complete genome sequence SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Accession NC_045512, Version NC_045512.2) as a reference genome.
The annotated genomes (n = 2,492) have been retrieved from publicly open database, the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) up to March 30, 2020.
Further information regarding the accession numbers of the studied genomes could be found in the Supplementary Data 1.
