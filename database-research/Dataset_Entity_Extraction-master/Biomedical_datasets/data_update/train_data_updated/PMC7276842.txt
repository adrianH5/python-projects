The connection between the reality of the COVID‐19 in the US and around the world and the magical realism in a story set in a Caribbean Sea harbor town in Colombia is tenuous at best.
There are some parallels, though: anxiety, fear, and suffering throughout the population, and the frantic search for a cure for those seriously affected by COVID‐19, similar to Dr. Urbino’s passion for finding a cholera cure in the book.
Other similarities between the current COVID‐19 pandemic and the fictional cholera outbreak described by García Márquez include personal resilience and indomitable spirit under trying circumstances…and that life after the pandemic is not the same.
Other lessons learned during the COVID‐19 pandemic for medical genetics practice include the utility of telemedicine, which until now was largely used only for patients in remote locations, but which may well become the new norm after being employed successfully while patients, their families and healthcare providers are isolated at home.
Lessons learned from these new models of teaching the next generation of healthcare professionals in medical genetics and genomics may well be incorporated in (re)designing future didactics in our field.
