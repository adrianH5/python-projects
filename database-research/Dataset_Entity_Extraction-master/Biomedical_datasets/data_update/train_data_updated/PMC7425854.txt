The initial publications describing genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 [1–4] used Illumina and Oxford nanopore data to elucidate the sequence composition of patient specimens (although only Wu and colleagues [3] explicitly provided the accession numbers for their raw short-read sequencing data).
We preprocessed currently available (as of February 19, 2020) sequencing read data sets for SARS-CoV-2 (S1 Table) by removing adapter contamination and reads derived from human transcripts and combined the resulting data sets.
There is no public access to sequence reads that were used to produce these assemblies: as of February 19, 2020—more than 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak—there were only six raw data sets (S1 Table).
Wu and colleagues [3] identified two potential recombination breakpoints within the SARS-CoV-2 S gene with some segments having higher similarity to Bat ZC45 and ZXC21 coronaviruses (accessions MG772933 and MG772934, respectively), whereas others were more similar to SARS Tor2 and SZ3 isolates (accessions AY274119 and AY304486).
The goal of our study was to (1) raise awareness of the lack of primary data necessary to effectively respond to global emergencies such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and (2) demonstrate that all analyses can be performed transparently with already-existing open-source publicly available tools and computational infrastructure.
Moreover, they should have access to computational infrastructure that can execute these tools and apply them to potentially large next-generation sequencing (NGS) data sets.
On February 21, 2020 new human data sets SRR11092056, SRR11092057, SRR11092058, and SRR11092064 were added to the SARS-CoV-2 archive [22].
Our analyses indicate that these data sets contain no useful SARS-CoV-2 data [23].
