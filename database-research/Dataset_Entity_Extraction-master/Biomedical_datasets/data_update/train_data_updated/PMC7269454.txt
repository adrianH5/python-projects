In December 2019, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, People’s Republic of China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has hence spread worldwide causing a global pandemic (1–3).
Megahit generated in all cases 7 contigs with more than 1,000 bp and 100× coverage; all of these assembled contigs were compared (using BLASTn) against the entire nonredundant (nr) nucleotide and protein databases.
The longer sequences were named hCoV-19/Italy/FVG/ICGEB_S1, _S5, _S8, and _S9 and were deposited in GISAID (see below).
Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the MEGAX program using the GISAID sequences available at 03-16-2020 (6).
Bootstrap support values were calculated from 500 pseudoreplicate trees of the whole data set (Fig. 2).
Despite a high burden of COVID-19 in Italy, very little information is available to date from full-length high-quality sequences.
The first sequences deposited in GISAID (EPI_ISL_410545 and EPI_ISL_410546) were collected in Rome from a Chinese tourist from Hubei province who got infected before visiting Italy, and another one (EPI_ISL_412974) was from a test-positive Italian citizen returning from China.
The longer sequences were named hCoV-19/Italy/FVG/ICGEB_S1, _S5, _S8, and _S9 and were deposited in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) with accession numbers EPI_ISL_417418, EPI_ISL_417419, EPI_ISL_417421, and EPI_ISL_417423, respectively (9).
