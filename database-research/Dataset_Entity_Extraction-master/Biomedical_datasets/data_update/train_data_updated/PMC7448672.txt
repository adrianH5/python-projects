At the time of this report in June 2020, the number of cases in the United States has reached nearly 2.2 million, and the number of deaths has exceeded 100,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University database (3).
SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which symptoms can vary from mild (e.g., fever, fatigue, dry cough) to severe illness (e.g., dyspnea, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, hypoxia, confusion), and can ultimately lead to death, particularly for those ≥65 years of age and those with certain underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes (4).
The majority of the SARS-CoV-2 NAATs available today are based on real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) methods, including the BioFire Defense COVID-19 test (BioFire) and the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion) evaluated in the present study.
The BEI Resources material was provided at a concentration of 4.1 × 109 genome equivalents (GE)/ml (2.8 × 105 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/ml before inactivation of the virus), from which the following serial dilutions were prepared (in GE/ml): 1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.3.
Other comparator studies of the Fusion assay have recently been reported, including the following: a study comparing the Fusion assay to the modified CDC assay, GenMark ePlex, and DiaSorin Simplexa (6); a study comparing Cepheid, ID NOW, and GenMark assays using Fusion as the reference standard (7); a study comparing Fusion, Cepheid, DiaSorin, and cobas assays and a laboratory-developed test (LDT) (8); and a study comparing Fusion to an in-house LDT targeting the envelope gene (9).
This study compared three of these assays, the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima), and the BioFire Defense COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance as well as workflow.
