In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China.
The Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship was put under quarantine soon after its return to Yokohama, Japan on February 3, 2020, after visiting Kagoshima, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Okinawa, because an 80-y-old passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed as a COVID-19 case on February 1 after the ship had departed from Hong Kong on January 25.
The Japanese government asked about 3,600 passengers and crew members to stay on board in Yokohama during the 14-d isolation period through February 19 to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 cases.
A field epidemiological study about the DP COVID-19 cases has been published (3).
As of March 8, 697 COVID-19 cases had been identified among the 3,711 persons on the DP and 7 people had died (4).
The 73 genome sequences (including 3 sequences of DP isolates deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data [GISAID]) were compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 (isolated on December 26, 2019 in China) genome sequence as a reference.
A number of nucleotide variations have been identified; specifically, 52 SNVs among DP isolates (n = 73) and 449 SNVs among all tested isolates, including entries from GISAID (n = 412), (Dataset S3) (Fig. 1).
Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis including other SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that are publicly available on GISAID and haplotype networks from genomic SNVs (HN-GSNVs) were used to map the genotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates that disseminated in the DP cruise ship after isolation of the passengers on February 5, 2020 (Fig. 2).
We did not find any area-specific events of COVID-19 spread in the DP because all COVID-19 patients were widely distributed in all 18 decks across the ship.
The highest incidence of COVID-19 onset was observed on February 7, 2020; the epidemic curve in the latter half of the epidemic was dominated by crew members whose work was not strictly controlled to maintain service on the ship (7).
Zhang et al. (9) also estimated that the reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 cases was 2.28 (95% confidence interval: 2.06 to 2.52) during the early stage, and estimated that the outbreak size on the DP cruise ship might have been greater, if the strict infection management and quarantine had not been conducted.
The personal data related to the clinical information were anonymized, and our procedure is not to request written consent for all patients suffering from COVID-19.
However, the virus content in pharyngeal swabs is not abundant at the early onset of COVID-19, which might lead to difficulties in achieving WGS.
The obtained NGS reads were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome sequence (29.9 kb single-strand RNA; GenBank ID: MN908947), resulting in a specimen-specific SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence fully mapped with a read depth of at least ≥100× from the 99- to 29,796-nt region of Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequence (see details in Dataset S2).
The nearly full-length genome sequence (≥29 kb) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates until February 19, 2020 were retrieved from the GISAID EpiCoV database on May 14, 2020, followed by multiple alignment using MAFFT v7.222 (17).
The poorly aligned regions in 5′ and 3′ ends were trimmed; we determined that the core regions were from the 99- to 29,794-nt position by comparison against the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequences (GISAID ID, EPI_ISL_402125; GenBank ID, MN908947.3).
Gap-containing sequences in the core region were excluded; sequences of 243 isolates from the GISAID database were used in subsequent analyses.
The genome sequences of the DP isolates were aligned using MAFFT with sequences retrieved from the database, followed by extraction of SNV and deletion sites.
