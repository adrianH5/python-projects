The recent emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a public health emergency across the globe [1–3].
The SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from a nasopharyngeal sample of a patient in Sweden and the isolated virus was confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 by sequencing (Genbank accession number MT093571).
The raw files were imported to Proteome Discoverer v2.4 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the Homo sapiens SwissProt (2020_01 release with 20,595 entries) and the pre-leased SARS-CoV-2 UniProt (completed with 14 SARS-CoV-2 sequences of COVID-19 UniProtKB release 2020_04_06) protein databases with Mascot v 2.5.1 search engine (MatrixScience Ltd., UK).
The pathway “Antiviral mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes” and two other events it participates were selected from Reactome database.
To further capture the patterns of expression changes in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a weighted co-expression network analysis on both transcriptomic and proteomic datasets using all genes and proteins detected, their functional assignments, and the top genes (Figure 2(a)) and proteins (Figure 2(b)) in key network elements.
To repurpose antiviral drugs targeting host-viral interactions is an attractive strategy to find drugs that might work against COVID-19.
Our data indicate a role of Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 in the cellular response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that drugs blocking this pathway could possibly be repurposed for COVID-19 patients.
The activation of Akt/mTOR signaling during SARS-CoV-2 infection could be to sustain protein synthesis by increased accession to translation components and by overcoming infection-associated stress by blocking autophagy and apoptosis [31].
In COVID-19 patients the severity of the disease is associated with a cytokine storm with markedly increased expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the serum of severe cases [42].
Whether the currently proposed drugs targeting the Akt/mTOR pathway can be indeed repurposed for COVID-19 therapies now needs to be tested carefully in in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection models and in in vivo COVID-19 disease models as improper regulation may pose a detrimental effect.
The ongoing phase I (SirCo-1, NCT04371640), phase II (The SCOPE trials, NCT04341675) and phase III (NCT04409327) trials that target mTOR in the severe COVID-19 patients will provide more information.
Further investigations are required to better understand the molecular sequelae in order to guide potential therapy in the management of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
