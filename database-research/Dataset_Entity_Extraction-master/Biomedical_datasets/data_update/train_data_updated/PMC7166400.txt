The complete genomes of 15 2019‐nCoV sequences have been downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).
A dataset has been built using five highly similar sequences for SARS, two sequences for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and five highly similar sequences for bat SARS‐like coronavirus.
The percentage of similarity has been identified using a basic local alignment search tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi); eventually duplicated sequences have been excluded from the datasets.
The dataset including 27 sequences has been aligned using multiple sequence alignment online tool
 and manually edited using BioEdit program v7.0.5.
