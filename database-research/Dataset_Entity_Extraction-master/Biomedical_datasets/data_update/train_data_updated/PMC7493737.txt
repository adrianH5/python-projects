Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, family Coronaviridae, is a positive-polarity single-stranded RNA virus that probably originated in bats (Andersen et al., 2020, Lu et al., 2020, Gorbalenya et al., 2020) and is the causative agent of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) (Li et al., 2020).
The dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic have proven to be complex.
Many challenges remain pertaining to a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathology, and transmission of COVID-19.
For example, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from an asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory illness to pneumonia, respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and death (Guan et al., 2020, Jiang et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020).
Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA has been detected in airborne material collected by air samplers positioned distal to COVID-19 patients (Liu et al., 2020, Guo et al., 2020, Santarpia et al., 2020, Chia et al., 2020).
Because efforts to isolate virus in cell cultures in the aforementioned air sampling studies in hospital wards were not made (Guo et al., 2020, Chia et al., 2020), or failed when they were attempted due to overgrowth by faster replicating respiratory viruses (Lednicky et al., 2020), and so far only one has provided evidence of virus isolation (Santarpia et al., 2020), uncertainties about the role of aerosols in COVID-19 transmission remain.
Because, we previously collected SARS-CoV-2 from the air of a respiratory illness ward within a clinic but were unable to isolate the virus in cell cultures due to out-competition by other respiratory viruses (Lednicky et al., 2020), we sought to perform air sampling tests in a hospital room reserved for COVID-19 patients, to lessen the probability of collecting other airborne human respiratory viruses.
We thus collected aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in a room housing COVID-19 patients using our VIVAS air samplers that collect virus particles without damaging them, thus conserving their viability.
Air samples were collected in a room that was part of a designated COVID-19 ward (Figure 1
).
Following the removal of host sequences (Chlorocebus sabaeus; GenBank assembly accession number GCA_000409795.2) using Kraken 2 (wood et al., 2019), de novo assembly of paired-end reads was performed in SPAdes v3.13.0 with default parameters (Bankevich et al., 2012).
Whereas the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents per liter of air were estimated (Table 2), the determination of the specific infectivity (ratio of SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents present for every one able to infect a cell in culture) required the performance of a plaque assay or a standard 50% endpoint dilution assay (TCID50 assay).
Plaque assays could not be performed due to a nationwide nonavailability of some critical media components (due to COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary lockdown of production facilities), so TCID50 assays were performed in Vero E6 cells to estimate the percentage of the collected virus particles that were viable.
Estimates ranged from 2 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air (Table 4
).
The nearly complete genome sequence (and the virus isolate) was designated SARS-CoV-2/human/UF-19/2020, and this genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. MT668716) and in GISAID (accession no. EPI_ISL_480349).
This complete genome sequence of the virus collected by the air samplers (and the virus therein) was considered the same isolate and designated SARS-CoV-2/Environment/UF-20/2020, and this genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. MT670008) and in GISAID (accession no. EPI_ISL_477163).
The virusâ€™ genomic sequence currently falls within GISAID clade B.1(GH), which is characterized by mutations C241T, C3037T, A23403G, G25563T, S-D614G, and NS3-Q57H relative to reference genome WIV04 (GenBank accession no.
As reported in air sampling tests performed by others (Liu et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020, Holshue et al., 2020, Santarpia et al., 2020) and in our previous report (Lednicky et al., 2020), airborne SARS-CoV-2 was present in a location with COVID-19 patients.
Unlike previous studies, we have demonstrated that the virus in aerosols can be viable, and this suggests that there is an inhalation risk for acquiring COVID-19 within the vicinity of people who emit the virus through expirations including coughs, sneezes, and speaking.
The amount of airborne virus detected per liter of air was small, and future studies should address (a) whether this is typical for COVID-19, (b) if this represented virus production relative to the phase of infection in the patient, (c) if this was a consequence of active air flow related to air exchanges within the room, (d) or if the low number of virus was due to technical difficulties in removing small airborne particles from the air (Pan et al., 2019).
Our findings reveal that viable SARS-CoV-2 can be present in aerosols generated by a COVID-19 patient in a hospital room in the absence of an aerosol-generating procedure, and can thus serve as a source for transmission of the virus in this setting.
Moreover, the public health implications are broad, particularly as current best practices for limiting the spread of COVID-19 center on social distancing, wearing of face coverings while in proximity to others and hand washing.
With the current surge of cases, to help stem the COVID-19 pandemic, clear guidance on control measures against SARS-CoV-2 aerosols are needed, as recently voiced by other scientists (Morawska and Milton, 2020).
Air samples collected in the hospital room of two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, one ready for discharge and the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture.
Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID 50 units/L of air.
Conclusions  Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.
