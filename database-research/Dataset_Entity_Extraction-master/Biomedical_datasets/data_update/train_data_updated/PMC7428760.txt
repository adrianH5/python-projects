(Coronavirus COVID-19 global cases by the centre for systems science and engineering at Johns Hopkins University) [2].
A total of 45 confirmed cases of COVID-19 diagnosed at Ramon and Cajal University Hospital between March and May 2020 were included in this pilot study.
In this web, frequencies are aggregated by country but reflect the distribution of HLA data available in this Net database.
To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works that study the role played by HLA molecules on individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of patients from Madrid, the Spanish region with the highest incidence of confirmed cases of COVID-19.
It has been reported to have a low affinity for the virus [13] and to be statistically significantly associated with severe SARS-CoV-1 disease and COVID-19 progression in studies conducted in various regions of China [12,27].
