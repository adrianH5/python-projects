Edouard Lansiaux has just shown that subjects from the regions of Puglia, Sardinia and Sicilia in Italy have a high prevalence of Beta-thalassemia and are, thus, more resistant to the coronavirus pneumonia called SARSCoV2, (formerly known as 2019-nCoV), that causes the COVID19 disease [1].
We should like to add that Ferrara, (132,000 inhabitants), a town in Northern Italy whose origins are from the Renaissance, situated in the region of Emilia Romagna, (4449 million inhabitants, 27,842 COVID+ patients, the third place most affected in Italy), is also very resistant to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On the 2nd June 2020, Italy counted 33,530 deaths and 233,197 cases COVID+.
A study has showed a heme attack on the 1-beta chain of haemoglobin by COVID-19.
