A total of eight variants of hACE2 that map to the interaction surface are described in the gnomAD database (Fig.Â 4
A).

By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak.
