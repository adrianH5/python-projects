The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is associated with the current pandemic outbreak of COVID‐19.
MERS betacoronavirus was used as a control data set as it is well‐studied in both hosts (human and camel), and as their close genetic relationship is well‐characterized.
For the next experiment, based on the alignment and comparison of the structures, MERS has been set as a control data set, due to the well‐characterized close relationship between human‐ and camel‐delivered strains.

Therefore, our results suggest that the human SARS‐CoV‐2, responsible for the current outbreak of COVID‐19, could also come from yak as an intermediate host.
