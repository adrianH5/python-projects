Till date, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), a national health programme, Government of India, has collected samples from symptomatic travellers in liaison with the State-level Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs), Department of Health Research.
These sequences were also compared with the available GenBank sequences to monitor the mutations and understand their relation with other known SARS-CoV-2 available in the public database.
Full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the GISAID database17 (Supplementary Table I (available from )).
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the MEGA software version 7.018 with retrieved sequences from two of the three positive cases and the available GISAID sequences.
The FastQ files were reference mapped with the available Wuhan seafood pneumonia virus (Wuhan Hu-1) complete SARS-CoV-2 genome (accession number: NC 045512.2).
Prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes revealed that one of these (residue positions 341-505) in the spike protein incorporates two of the predicted linear epitopes (327-342 and 404-419) having good antigenicity along with a favourable IFN-Î³ response that enables differentiation and proliferation of the B-cells25.
The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512).
