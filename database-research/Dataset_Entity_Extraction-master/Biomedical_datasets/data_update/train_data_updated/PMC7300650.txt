We used a large database of HLA allele frequencies in world populations (with alleles defined at the second‐field level of resolution, third and fourth‐field levels being recoded to second‐field) including data from both the literature (1992‐2017) and reports of the 11th to 16th International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshops (IHIWs).
For each of the different loci (HLA‐A, ‐B, ‐C, ‐DRB1, ‐DQA1 and ‐DQB1), the dataset comprises between 158 and 374 typed samples, classified according to the hla‐net.eu guidelines,
 into 10 sub‐continental regions, that is, Sub‐Saharan Africa (SAF), North Africa (NAF), Europe (EUR), South‐West Asia (SWA), North‐East Asia (NEA), South‐East Asia (SEA), Australia (AUS), Oceania (OCE), North America (NAM) and South America (SAM).
All HLA‐A, ‐B, ‐C, and ‐DRB1 alleles that were observed in at least five populations worldwide (according to our database of allele frequencies), that is 92 HLA‐A, 164 HLA‐B, 55 HLA‐C and 94 HLA‐DRB1 were selected to assess the peptide‐binding affinity of their corresponding proteins HLA‐A, HLA‐B, HLA‐C and HLA‐DR, respectively, the latter representing the HLA‐DRA/DRB1 dimer as HLA‐DRA is here considered monomorphic.
A single model including binding kind as a third predictor was considered and provided similar results but, because three‐way interactions were necessary to report the model, we preferred splitting the data set according to binding kind to simplify the presentation of results.
