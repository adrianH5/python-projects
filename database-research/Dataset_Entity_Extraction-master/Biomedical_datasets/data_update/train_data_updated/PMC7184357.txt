Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, was first identified in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 and has now spread worldwide.
The etiologic agent of COVID-19 is a β-coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus that caused the much more limited SARS outbreak of 2002–2003, and to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the etiologic agent for MERS.
The case fatality rate for COVID-19 is considerably lower than that reported for SARS (17%) or MERS (40%) [2]; however, SARS-CoV-2 spread much more rapidly, quickly causing many more total deaths than infection with both previous coronaviruses combined.
Currently, there are no effective treatments for COVID-19 and our understanding of the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 is limited.
