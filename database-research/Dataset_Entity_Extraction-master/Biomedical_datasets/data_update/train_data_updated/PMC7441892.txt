The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 [1], has accumulated 6057.853 confirmed cases globally until June 1 [2].
The etiologic agent of COVID-19 is a novel beta coronavirus [3], which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [4].
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic shows marked geographic variation in its prevalence and mortality.
It was recently suggested that a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) imbalance impacts all stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical findings thereof, placing RAS molecules at the center of COVID-19 pathophysiology.
In this context, Delanghe et al. [49] analyzed not only the prevalence and mortality data (per 1,000,000 inhabitants) of the COVID-19 infection of several countries but also the frequency of several polymorphisms in genes of some human plasma proteins, including the ACE I/D polymorphism.
The results of this study suggest that the prevalence of COVID-19 is significantly correlated with the ACE1 polymorphism.
In our study, we included only information from the dbSNPs, Ensembl Genome Browser, and 1000 Genome Project databases.
Discrete sequence databases of individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 were not analyzed.
The prevalence and mortality of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic show marked geographic variation.
