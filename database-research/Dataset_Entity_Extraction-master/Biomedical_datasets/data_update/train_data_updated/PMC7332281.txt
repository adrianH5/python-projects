In January, 2020, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, China; the disease was subsequently named COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or mild symptomatic infections to severe respiratory symptoms and death, with older age groups generally presenting with more severe disease and higher death rates.2, 3 Since its identification, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe.
On June 22, 2020, 177 countries had reported cases of COVID-19, adding up to more than 8·9 million reported cases and 468 000 deaths worldwide.
During the WHO–China Joint Mission on COVID-19, 2055 laboratory confirmed cases were reported in health-care workers from 476 hospitals in China, mostly (88%) from Hubei province.
A follow-up study was done at three hospitals to assess the clinical presentations of COVID-19 of these health-care workers.
PPE was used according to national guidelines that applied during this period of the outbreak.10, 11 Patients with suspected COVID-19 were nursed under strict isolation precautions and health-care workers applied additional PPE (gowns, gloves, goggles, hair cover, and type IIR surgical masks) on entering the isolation room.
Primers were trimmed using cutadapt, after which a reference-based alignment to the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) sequence EPI_ISL_412973 was done using minimap2.
All available full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes were retrieved from GISAID on March 20, 2020 (appendix 1 pp 8–65), and aligned with the newly obtained SARS-CoV-2 sequences in this study using the multiple sequence alignment software MUSCLE (version 3.8.1551).
One health-care worker (who reported first symptoms on Feb 21, 2020) attended several carnival events while symptomatic but unaware of having COVID-19. 31 (32%) health-care workers reported close contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 in the 14 days before onset of symptoms, either a patient (n=3), colleague (n=18), household member (n=1), or another person outside the hospital (n=9).

Most (81–100%) health-care workers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the three hospitals did not work on a ward with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (appendix 1 p 2).
In the present study, we combined epidemiological data with WGS to obtain a deeper understanding of the sources and modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at three hospitals in the south of the Netherlands, which were the first hospitals to identify patients with COVID-19 in the Netherlands.
Although possible hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and health-care workers with COVID-19 have been reported,3, 30, 31 to our knowledge, our study is the first to use WGS to analyse possible SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial transmission.
Moreover, the sequence-based analysis could be biased when sampling and sequencing is not done systematically and when sequence data in some areas are scarce, as is the case for COVID-19 internationally.
