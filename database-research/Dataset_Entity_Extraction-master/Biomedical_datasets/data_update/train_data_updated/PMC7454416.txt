Four decades ago in 1985, alleles of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε2/ε3/ε4 became famous for explaining 16% of genetic variance in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the benchmark study of Sing and Davignon (1): total blood cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were elevated by ApoE ε4 (ApoE4) allele and lowered by ApoE ε2 (ApoE2).
Preexisting morbidities increase risk of COVID-19 infections and mortality: for young adults: diabetes and obesity; for older people: diabetes and dementia (14,15).
COVID-19 also damages the cardiovascular system with atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, and disseminated coagulation (16).
These morbidities are also associated with variants in the ApoE gene cluster that we hypothesize are relevant to COVID-19.
ApoE4 homozygotes have 2.2-fold higher risk for COVID-19 positivity and 4.3-fold more case-fatality after COVID-19 than ApoE3 homozygotes (17,18).
Heterozygosity (ε3/ε4) was modestly associated with COVID-19 below linear dose dependence.
Strong associations for ε4/ε4 with COVID-19 were not diminished by excluding dementia, hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), or type II diabetes.
Based on these associations, Kuo et al. hypothesize that ApoE4 has recessive effects on COVID-19 outcomes and suggest that these effects are independent of these common age-related diseases.
We discuss how ApoE allele pleiotropies can mediate COVID-19 infectivity and survival.
We hypothesize that ApoE4 associations with COVID-19 extend to the ApoE gene complex with balancing detrimental and protective effects in haplotypes, and multiple gene-by-gene transcriptional interactions (28).
This approach could identify protective genes for COVID-19.
ApoE2 also merits consideration in COVID-19, given its benefit to CVD and AD.
Several ApoE cluster genes may interact with COVID-19, for example, NECTIN2 (herpes receptor HHV1) and ApoC1 which, like ApoE, is in the HCV envelope (42).
ApoE cluster haplotypes associate with the same morbidities from CVD and obesity (43,44) that increase vulnerability to COVID-19.
