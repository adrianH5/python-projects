Incorporation of the nitrogen atom in the course of evolution allowed the synthesis of amino acids, as well as nucleic acids.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly identified following the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, as viruses appear to be identified only by the infectious diseases that they cause.
Viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the current COVID-19 epidemic, are a key to the understanding of life and evolution.
Nitrogen incorporation in the primordial cell chemistry allowed synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acids, a prelude to RNA and subsequently DNA.
