The outbreak of coronavirus COVID-19 has become a most challenging health emergency in over the world [4,5].
The number of deaths associated COVID-19 is greatly higher than the other two coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), and the outbreak is still ongoing, which global concern to the public health and economics [14].
The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
There are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 [17].
That could be used as peptide vaccines against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.
The S protein sequence was retrieved from NCBI at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein and saved in FASTA format for further analyses; then Protein BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) against reference sequence on the database was performed using Blosum80 matrix to collect homologous sequences between different Coronaviruses.
S protein sequence with accession No. QII57161.1 is available as a query for protein BLAST against Coronavirus producing a set of sequences containing various species of Coronaviruses.
The best epitopes recommended by this server are ‘‘LNEVAKNLNESLIDLQELGK’‘, “TLVKQLSSNFGAISSVLNDI”, “QQLIRAAEIRASANLAATKM” and “KEELDKYFKNHTSPDVDLGD” at regions 1186–1205, 961–980, 1010–1029 and 1149–1168 respectively.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus that it disease spreads in over the world.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.
