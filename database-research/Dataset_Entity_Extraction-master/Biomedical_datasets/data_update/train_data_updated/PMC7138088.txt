Currently, a total of 14 full‐length sequences of the 2019‐nCoV were released to GISAID and GeneBank.
The newly sequenced Beta‐coronavirus (MN908947) genome was downloaded from the GenBank database.
We divided our data set into four clades, the newly discovered 2019‐nCoV sequence was grouped as the query sequence.
Interestingly, no similar sequence was found with known sequence in the database, suggesting that a putative recombination parent virus was still unknown.
