SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, an acute respiratory distress syndrome which represents the most serious problem for global health (Cascella et al., 2020).
However, since March 2020, some manufacturers reported the shortage of supplies related to COVID-19 driven by the sudden increase in global demand for RNA extraction kits.
However, heating oropharyngeal swabs is not as sensitive or accurate as RT-qPCR reactions performed on purified samples, detecting 97.4 % of the COVID-19-positive patients with no false positives results (Fomsgaard and Rosenstierne, 2020).
Also, Chelex-100 was incorporated as a protective agent during extraction at high temperatures because this reagent favors chelating groups to bind to cellular components (Lounsbury et al., 2012).
This protocol allowed detecting only 97.4 % of COVID-19-positive patients in comparison to PEG/NaCl precipitation that detected 100 % of the positive cases.
