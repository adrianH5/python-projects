After being interviewed by quarantine officers, she was transferred to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute (BIDI) Hospital, Nonthaburi, for isolation and laboratory investigations.
Genomic sequencing analysis included Sanger and next generation sequencing were performed by the Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Center, the Thai Red Cross Society and the Thai National Institute of Health, Department of Medical Sciences and the sequence shared via the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database (EPI_ISL_403962).
Subsequent genome sequencing was again compatible with the SARS-CoV-2 and shared via the GISAID EpiCoV database (EPI_ISL_403963).
The genomes of the two separate cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are identical over the full length of close to 30 kb and are furthermore identical to five other sequences (four from Wuhan and one from Zhejiang); together these sequences form the largest cluster of identical cases within the early outbreak, comprising a core of at least indirectly linked cases (Figure 2).
According to the cases’ history, the two imported COVID-19 cases described here are not directly linked, yet their genomes are identical.
The missing link to the market, the time of travel and onset of symptoms in the two COVID-19 cases together with the incubation period of mean 6.4 days (range: 5.6–7.7) [16] and the time of closest genome neighbours obtained from sequences in Wuhan, suggest that transmission within Wuhan beyond the Huanan Seafood Market is likely to have occurred in the first week of January or earlier.
Therefore, while one cannot exclude the possibility that asymptomatic cases in their incubation period would be missed and become infectious later, screening of incoming travellers from an affected area proved successful at least in these two instances, when COVID-19 cases were detected, isolated, observed and only discharged once they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Rapid response including genome sequencing and sharing via GISAID [18,19] (https://www.gisaid.org/) enabled fast dissemination of results and provided a glimpse of early transmission patterns in this outbreak.
We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in travellers from Wuhan, China to Thailand.
