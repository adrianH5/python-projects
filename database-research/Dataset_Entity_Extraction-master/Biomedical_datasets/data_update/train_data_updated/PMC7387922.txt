The homologous protein structures of 2′OMTase with PDB ID: 3R24 [12,13], 2XYR [12,13] from human SARS-CoV and 2′OMTase with PDB ID 5YN5 from Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 [Unpublished] were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB).
The topology diagram showing the secondary structures present in 2′OMTase was generated by using PDBSum (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/Generate.html).
All the FDA approved drugs were downloaded from the zinc database and DrugBank and converted into 3D format for high-throughput virtual screening.
The active site volume of homologous 2′OMTase for PDB ID 3R24_A was 946.75 Å3 and for PDB ID 2XYR was 537.38 Å3.
