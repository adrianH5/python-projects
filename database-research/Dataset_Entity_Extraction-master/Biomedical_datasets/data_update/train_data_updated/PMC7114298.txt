X-ray data were collected on crystals of the PLpro-ISG15 complex at 100 K using a Dectris Eiger 9M detector (a 2°/s spindle rate) on beamline 21-ID-D at the Life Sciences-Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT).
To determine the initial phases for the PLpro-ISG15 complex, the PLpro domain from the bound PLpro-Ub complex (PDB accession code: ) was used as a search model and the programs Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) and Phenix were used to identify a molecular replacement solution.
Free human ISG15 (Narasimhan et al., 2005) with the PDB accession code of  was manually positioned into the corresponding residual electron density using the program Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004).
The wild-type pEVL8-his8-TEVp-MERS-CoV PLpro-ΔUbl2 plasmid was used as a template and primers were designed and synthesized using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).
Three complete X-ray datasets were collected on crystals of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ISG15 complex that were grown at three different citrate concentrations (0.2, 0.3 and 0.35 M).
To identify potential residues of MERS-CoV PLpro that dictate substrate specificity for ISG15 versus Ub, the MERS-CoV PLpro-ISG15 structure was superimposed with the Ub-bound structure (PDB accession code ) and the result is shown in Fig. 3
