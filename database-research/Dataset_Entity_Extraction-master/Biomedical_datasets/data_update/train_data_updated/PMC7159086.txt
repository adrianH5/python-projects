The remaining data were then aligned to the local nucleotide database (using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment) and non-redundant protein database (using RapSearch), downloaded from the US National Center for Biotechnology Information website, which contain only coronaviruses that have been published.
Mapped assemblies were also done using the bat-derived SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 (accession number MG772933.1) as a reference.
After removing host (human) reads, de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database.
A Blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-nCoV revealed that the most closely related viruses available on GenBank were bat-SL-CoVZC45 (sequence identity 87·99%; query coverage 99%) and another SARS-like betacoronavirus of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (accession number MG772934; 87·23%; query coverage 98%).
The subgenus Sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades: two SARS-CoV-related strains from Rhinolophus sp from Bulgaria (accession number GU190215) and Kenya (KY352407) formed clade 1; the ten 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and the two bat-derived SARS-like strains from Zhoushan in eastern China (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 2, which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses; and SARS-CoV strains from humans and many genetically similar SARS-like coronaviruses from bats collected from southwestern China formed clade 3, with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions (figure 3).
The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8) as a template.
