Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in November 2019 in Wuhan (China), and from there it was transmitted and rapidly dispersed all over the world (Jin et al., 2020).
In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
The spread of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19 has a link to unsustainable use of the environment.
A relationship between pollutants and viral diseases (such as COVID-19) was recently reported (Tsatsakis et al., 2020).
This is an important finding, because pollutants can depress the immune system of animals and thus might increase the impacts of pathogens, such as the current global coronary disease (COVID-19).
The main effects of COVID-19 on human health are related to respiratory problems (Xu et al., 2020b).
This fine particulate matter can obstruct the airways, exacerbating the effects of COVID-19.
Some research has correlated fine particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) with confirmed cases of deaths due to COVID-19 (Table 1
).
They found a strong relationship between PM2.5 and death risk from COVID-19.
The study conducted by Saha et al. (2020) also reported that areas with better air quality showed a larger number of COVID-19 recoveries.
Concerns have been raised regarding an association of indoor air pollution with susceptibility to COVID-19, mainly in geographical areas where wood or coal is still used for cooking and heating (Mbandi, 2020; Sharma and Hossain, 2020).
All available research so far show a positive correlation between air pollution (PM2.5) and COVID-19.
The evidence indicates that particulate matter appears to play a key role in the incidence and severity of cases of COVID-19, because it acts as a carrier of viruses, influences lung obstruction, and produces immunological effects by chemicals associated with it.
The underlying question here is whether multiple pollutants carried simultaneously on particulate matter act in an additive, synergistic way to increase the severity of COVID-19-like diseases.
The relationships between confirmed cases or deaths by COVID-19 and environmental factors has been studied in Europe, Middle East, and Asia (mainly China, Table 2
).
Temperature appears to be the environmental factor most related to COVID-19 spreading.
A study performed in several locations of China found that environmental factors by themselves could not explain variations in those cases of confirmed COVID-19 (Poirier et al., 2020).
Interestingly, environmental variables have been found to be crucial just in the initial phase of the COVID-19 infection, during which time the dynamics of transmission are more affected by airborne viral infectivity rather than human-to-human transmission (Coccia, 2020).
Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the air (Liu et al., 2020c), the way environmental factors may affect COVID-19 transmission is not well established.
It is necessary to assess whether environmental factors really have a cause-and-effect relationship for infection cases or deaths by COVID-19.
There is evidence for an indirect effect (negative/positive) of COVID-19 on environmental outcomes, mainly related to preventive confinement measures on the population imposed worldwide by various authorities (Fig. 1
, Braga et al., 2020, Corlett et al., 2020, Saadat et al., 2020, Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020).
The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused various positive impacts on the environment and the climate (Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020a).
In USA, NO2 declined around 25% during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 2017–2019 levels (Berman and Ebisu, 2020).
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, greenhouse gases raised average global temperatures, causing melting of glaciers and rising sea levels.
The use of wood for heating, along with other commonly used fossil fuel, probably increases outdoor and/or indoor air pollution, which is worrisome considering that air pollution is associated with COVID-19 (Setti et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b).
Hospital wastewater usually contains high levels of drugs, and one would expect that their concentrations and diversity has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a higher demand by patients (Escher et al., 2011; Jelic et al., 2011; Ort et al., 2010).
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are some of the drugs that have been used to treat COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020a).
As of July 2020, there are more than 15 million confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world, and an unknown number of negative cases (Dong et al., 2020).
On the contrary, plastics and drugs in wastewater produced during this pandemic by COVID-19 will persist longer, particularly those are not biodegradable.
There are key lessons that can be learned from COVID-19, which relate to the need to be prepared and environmentally responsible.
It is necessary to establish preventive epidemiological models (e.g., monitoring of domestic wastewater) to detect the occurrence of COVID-19 in advance.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic.
This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats.
Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action.
Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported.
Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19.
Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases.
