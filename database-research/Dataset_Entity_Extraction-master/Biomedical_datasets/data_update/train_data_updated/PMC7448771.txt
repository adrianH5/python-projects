Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic as of Mar. 2020.
African Americans and Latinos are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and show significantly higher mortality compared to the other race and ethnic groups in the US (Wadhera et al., 2020) and in the UK (Kirby, 2020).
Of note, a 3p21.31 gene cluster—SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1—is associated with genetic susceptibility for severe COVID-19 cases with respiratory failure (Ellinghaus et al., 2020).
To find allelic variation across populations in the genes that are known be involved in viral entry to the host cells and sensing of viral RNA in host immune cells, we surveyed publicly available databases of genomic variants.
Recent studies demonstrated that an inhibitor of the protease activity of TMPRSS2—camostat mesylate—attenuated SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung epithelial cells suggesting a promising candidate for potential intervention against COVID-19 (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
The list of reported genetic variants in the genes and their allele frequencies (AFs) were compiled from three population-scale genomic variants databases— gnomAD (Karczewski et al., 2020), Korean Reference Genome Database (Jung et al., 2020), and TogoVar (a Japanese genetic variation database available at https://togovar.biosciencedbc.jp/) —and three whole-genome sequencing datasets (i.e., 1000 Genomes Project (Clarke et al., 2017), Gene-Tissue Expression (Consortium et al., 2017), and Simons Genome Diversity Project (Mallick et al., 2016)).
However, it was found with higher AF of 0.23% at Japanese genetic variation database (N = 3552).
Especially, ACE2 and TLR7 seem to be under strong selection pressure as reflected in their relatively lower number of loss-of-function variants than expected in large variant databases such as gnomAD (Karczewski et al., 2020): three observed variants out of 31 expected ones for ACE2 and two observed variants out of 20.7 expected ones for TLR7.
Moreover, nonsynonymous variants in these genes were mostly of very low frequencies which suggests the chance of gene function altered by these variants would be unlikely, compared to the incidence of COVID-19 around the globe.
Therefore, underlying medical conditions, age, environmental factors (e.g., air pollution, smoking, and humidity), and a healthcare disparity influence morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 considering the allelic spectrum for the key genes associated with viral entry.
The population-scale genotype databases and datasets used in this study have limitations from relatively small sample size and imbalanced and incomplete representation of various human populations.
Thus, there could be unreported variants in ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TLR3/7/8 that may be associated with change of susceptibility to COVID-19.
With additional population-scale genomic databases for diverse populations, it will be possible to identify the individuals with rare genetic variants such as rs758278442 in the interacting domain of ACE2 and the genetic predisposition to cytokine storm that causes an acute progress of illness in young people.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted healthcare disparities in multiple countries.
Non-genetic factors are likely to contribute differential population characteristics affected by COVID-19.
