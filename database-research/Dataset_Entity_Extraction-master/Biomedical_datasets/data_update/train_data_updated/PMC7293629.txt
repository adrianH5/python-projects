We calculated a phylogenetic analysis network of the 160 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) complete genomes submitted to the international Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by early March 2020, to produce a snapshot of the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (1).
Included in the dataset was the closest known nonhuman coronavirus, a bat coronavirus with more than 96% sequence similarity to the human virus.
We ran the bat sequence as part of the human dataset.
Mavian et al. (8) state that our findings are based on a nonrepresentative dataset of 160 genomes, with no significant correlation between prevalence of confirmed cases and number of sequenced strains per country.
We respond that our data are based on the first 160 high-quality genomes collected, sequenced, and uploaded to the international GISAID database, in order to shed light on the early development of the coronavirus.
The early outbreak was centered on China, and naturally in this early dataset China is well represented.
