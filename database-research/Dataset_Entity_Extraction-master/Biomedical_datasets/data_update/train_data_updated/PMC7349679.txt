Considering the epidemic nature SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 outbreak, identifying the intermediate and original host of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for preventing new large-scale infection and transmission of viruses.
The host identification was also based on these 95 complete SARS-CoV-2 records from GISAID.
The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan this time was firstly located at a so-called seafood market, but actually it was a live animal market because a variety of animals were for sale in this seafood market for a long time.
We collected 823 coronaviruses with other animal hosts on NCBI and 3 pangolin-CoVs from GISAID and compared these 826 records with the 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains.
All the accession numbers of the datasets are shown in Supplementary files S1, S2 and S3.
The biological distance between two sequences can be expressed as the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding natural vectors in 12-dim space, as applied on many datasets [25].
Therefore, for a dataset of n sequences, the relationship is here described as a  pairwise distance matrix.
For a dataset of n units, we first find the neighbor of each unit by searching for the smallest distance from each unit to any other units.
Patients possibly became infected during their stay in Wuhan, but showed no obvious symptoms during the incubation, and after returning to home city/province, had fever or dry cough that further confirmed to be COVID-19.
Though we have filtered out these sequences, it also decreases the size of dataset.
In [50], the author collected 86 complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains on GISAID, and performed pair-wise nucleotide sequence alignment by ClustalX2.
The severe respiratory disease COVID-19 was initially reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and spread into many provinces from Wuhan.
As of 2 May, 2020, over 3 million COVID-19 cases had been confirmed, and 235,290 deaths had been reported globally, and the numbers are still increasing.
