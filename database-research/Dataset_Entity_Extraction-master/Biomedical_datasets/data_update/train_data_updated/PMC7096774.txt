To date, the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is spreading throughout the world.
The first COVID-19 case in Finland was a female Chinese tourist in her 30s, who had left Wuhan on 22 January and arrived in Finland on 23 January.
Suspicion of COVID-19 led to her direct transfer to the Lapland Central Hospital in Rovaniemi, where she was isolated and sampled on 28 and 29 January for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1).
Nearly the complete coding region of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession number: MT020781) was sequenced from the NPS collected on Day 4 (Table) and the complete coding region was sequenced from the virus isolate obtained after three passages in Vero E6 cells.
In the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, confirmed cases outside China were mostly imported among travellers from Wuhan [7].
As at 17 March 2020, 358 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been detected in Finland.
The risk of widespread national community transmission of COVID-19 infection in the European Union, European Economic Area and the United Kingdom in the coming weeks is considered high by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [8].
Current guidelines from the World Health Organization for testing COVID-19 recommend collection of both acute and convalescent serum samples from patients for serological testing, which can support the identification of the immune response to a specific viral pathogen [10].
The first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Finland was confirmed on 29 January 2020.
