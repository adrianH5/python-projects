COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency affecting more than 200 countries and territories resulting in more than 10 million reported cases by June 30 and over 500,000 deaths [1].
COVID-19 spreads via the respiratory route to close contacts and social contact patterns are therefore a key factor shaping the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious agents in a population [3, 4].
Recruitment of participants occurred via sharing of a survey link on the social media platforms Facebook and Twitter to followers and readers of the science.lu website following the publication of a general interest article on COVID-19 [8].
Similar to these estimates, our results explain the rapid decline in SARS-CoV-19 transmission, also resulting in the rapid decline of COVID-19 cases observed since the beginning of the lockdown in Luxembourg.
This increase in social contacts most likely resulted in the increase of the reproduction number followed by growing COVID-19 incidence that had been observed by the end of June.
Our results suggest that older individuals are more compliant with restriction measures compared to younger persons, which is expected since the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 increases with age [5].
While the number of social contacts was substantially lower during the lockdown by more than 80% compared to the pre-pandemic period, we observed a more recent 121% increase during the post lockdown period showing an increased potential for COVID-19 spread.
Monitoring social contacts is an important indicator to estimate the possible impact of government interventions on social contacts and the COVID-19 spread in the coming months.
