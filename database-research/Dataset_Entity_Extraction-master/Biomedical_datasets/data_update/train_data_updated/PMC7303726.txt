We are seeing that even in epidemics from an infectious agent like COVID-19, there are differing clinical phenotypes that lead to MODS, requiring changes in therapeutic course (14, 15).
Using only the first of the paired-end reads, we performed bacterial and viral read mapping with kraken2-2.0.7-beta (61) used against the full transcriptome database of the tool downloaded on June 24, 2019.
Samples were normalized to every million mapped reads to human and clustered based on patient ID.
Using GTEx (28) tissue annotated expression data sets, we filtered for genes that are unique to each tissue/organ.
All sex-specific organs were removed from the database to begin.
While reads align to some of these transcriptomes, reads may belong to closely related species not within our transcriptome database.
This is further exemplified by viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19, that show selectivity in age- and sex-related vulnerability and inflammatory phenotypes leading to differences in presentation, severity, and management (14, 17).
