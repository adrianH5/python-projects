In December 2019, a coronavirus disease (named as COVID-19 later) was reported in Wuhan city, which rapidly spread throughout China and then to many other countries in the world (Li et al., 2020a, Zhu et al., 2020b).
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
The HFH4-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with 3 × 104 TCID50 virus each and sacrificed to collect tissue and blood samples at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection (DPI) (Figure 1
A).
All the dying mice (dead or lost >20% body weigh) showed significantly decreased lymphocyte numbers, which is one of the key clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 patients (Wang et al., 2020).
The lung isolates indicated two mutations, C14554T (nsp13, L372F) and C23525T (spike, H644Y), compared with the genome of SARS-CoV-2-WIV04 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_402124).
The viral titers in the infected lung ranged from 9.4 × 103 to 9.1 × 105TCID50 per gram of tissue, as determined by serial dilution of VeroE6 cell lines (Figure S5
).
These mice generated antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that could neutralize 100 TCID50 viruses at dilutions of 1:10 to 1:40 (Table S4).
We then intranasally infected the three SARS-CoV-2 survivors and another three healthy mice with 7 × 105 TCID50 virus/each.
COVID-19 patients commonly exhibit pneumonia with typical signs including fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltration (Guan et al., 2020).
Some alveolar cells were dissolved and necrotic, and some terminal bronchioles were blocked, which simulated the pathological findings in COVID-19 patients (Xu et al., 2020).
During routine blood examination, lymphopenia is a common feature in COVID-19 patients, and some patients had high-level aspartate amino transferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK) (Chen et al., 2020, Guan et al., 2020).
There are few reports about organ tropism of virus infection in the patients of COVID-19, but multiple organ infections have been reported in SARS patients (Gu et al., 2005).
In summary, a human ACE2 mouse model that partially simulated the pathology of COVID-19, will be a valuable platform for testing vaccines and other potential therapeutics.
The successful establishment of an animal model for COVID-19 pathogenesis will be valuable for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2.
Three days after inoculation, CPE was scored, and the Reed-Muench formula was used to calculate the TCID50.
Mice were anaesthetised with tribromoethanol (Avertin) (250 mg/kg) and intranasally infected with 3∗104 TCID50 (for naive infection) or 7∗105 TCID50 (for the viral challenge) SARS-CoV-2 in 50 μL DMEM per mouse.
COVID-19 has spread worldwide since 2019 and is now a severe threat to public health.
The infected mice generated typical interstitial pneumonia and pathology that were similar to those of COVID-19 patients.
