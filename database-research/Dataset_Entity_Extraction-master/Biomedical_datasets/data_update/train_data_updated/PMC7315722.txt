Strategies to limit the severe pandemic and to manage coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients strongly depend on readily available, accurate and reliable RT-PCR assays to detect the genome of the causative agent acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in biosamples.
This stool sample was from a 5-year-old child with COVID-19 [7] and was chosen because of high initial PCR signals and sufficient sample availability to generate large quantities of eluate for further distribution.
When compared with all genomes available on GISAID (9,184 SARS-CoV-2 genomes on 15 April 2020, Supplement), the regions used for amplification in the CDC and Charité protocol are highly conserved: Only 1.55%, 0.45% and 2.4% of genome sequences contain any kind of mismatch within the primer/probe regions of the CDC N1, N2 and N3 protocols, respectively, and 0.25%, 0.29% and 0.67% in the primer/probe regions of the Charité E, RdRp and N protocols, respectively.
Of note, in a routine clinical setting, the CDC N1 reaction also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nucleic acid extracts from 37 of 83 sera (45%) from COVID-19 patients in intensive care units, with a positive correlation of their Cp values with those of the corresponding respiratory material (Spearman Rank correlation co-efficient r=0.4285, p (two-tailed) < 0.0001 (data not shown)).
Containment strategies and clinical management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients during the current pandemic depend on reliable diagnostic PCR assays for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
