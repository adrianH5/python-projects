At a global level—as excellently elaborated by Prasad et al—4 COVID-19 both unveiled and exacerbated existing inequalities and injustices within a country, making different populations particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and its sequelae, among them people living in poverty, without shelter, without regular residence, without employment or people living in residential care facilities.
They were soon identified as being the most vulnerable in these countries with high risk for COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes due to frailty and chronic comorbidities,8 exposed to circumstances with staff shortage, insufficient access to personal protective equipment and limited staff training in infection prevention and control.9
At the beginning of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities, ethicists and the medical community of high-income countries, however, anxiously focused on the ICUs.
In Europe, many hospitals increasingly reported to have quickly maximised resource capacities, reduced postponable interventions and—although challenging—being able to adequately respond to COVID-19 related medical needs of the population.
This is the story of the COVID-19 tragedy observable in many high-income countries in these days, told through the lens of medicine as a social science, focusing history of medicine and social epidemiology: with the pandemic spread of COVID-19, wealthy countries have built their responses informed by natural science and epidemiology,4 focusing the acute setting, personal protective equipment and testing, and establishing ethics guidelines for the expected ‘tough’ triage of lifesaving resources like ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in acute hospitals.
As COVID-19 can affect an individual without (initially) being symptomatic, the virus easily spread despite lockdown conditions via healthcare teams and residents’ interactions.
In many high-income countries, already before COVID-19, a great ‘viral dying’ can be observable in residential care facilities every winter.
Compared with that, COVID-19 is much deadlier, and we currently have no vaccination and only very limited treatment options.
As the current evidence therefore increasingly reveals,8–14 16 age, frailty and comorbidities are important risk factors, but the social context of nursing homes as well as other communal establishments10 in many high-income countries contributes, according to Virchow’s social hygiene hypothesis, immensely to the death toll itself, with a variation from zero % (Hong Kong) to up to 85% of all COVID-19 related deaths according to official figures (Canada), with excess rates of nursing home deaths not entirely being dependent on the total share of national COVID-19 related deaths.
17 18 The current evidence strongly suggests that the isolation measures have not been effective in preventing the COVID-19 spread.
For sure, it would be more humane and safer, and, as up to 85% of COVID-19 related deaths in high-income countries are nursing home residents, with the exception of Hong Kong, implementing whole nursing home repeated testing of staff and residents and a short, sharp quarantine for residents, which should be carefully evaluated,8 and approximately 34% of all deaths are people living in communal establishments,10 the next pandemic might not be as deadly, even without having highly effective treatments or a vaccination at hand.
To alleviate the global death toll of COVID-19 with the variety of contextual and local vulnerabilities and populations needing specific protection,4 like people living in refugee camps, undocumented working migrants in agriculture or the meat industry, often accommodated in large lodgings, as well as those living in poor neighbourhoods, we might finally again refer to Dr Virchow, calling for more social justice, as ‘politics is nothing but medicine at a larger scale’.
