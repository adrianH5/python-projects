We carried out SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by two first-line real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays [9], one of which (SpikeP_ps80) was developed in-house as soon as the first SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank Accession no. MN908947) was released by Chinese teams (on January 10, 2020).
At 7:00 pm the same day, after a run of 4Â h on the GridION X5 instrument (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd., Oxford, UK), we were able to obtain using the CLC Genomics tool (https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/), by mapping 42 reads with an average length of 1433 nucleotides on a set of coronavirus genomes from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource [11], a 18,611-nucleotide-long consensus sequence corresponding to approximately 62% of the viral genome (EMBL Accession no. ERS4366776).
This sequence, by similarity search using the BLASTn tool [12] against the NCBI nucleotide sequence database (GenBank), found as best hit the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank Accession no.
A total of 18,585 reads could be mapped on the SARS-CoV-2 genome GenBank Accession no.
