COVID-19 is caused by an RNA virus that produces Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
After this stage the 1st step of protection may take place by the use of shRNAs that may be incorporated within the host cell far before the infection.
After the uptake of this nanoconjugate the shRNA-plasmid is incorporated within the genome of the cell and start transcribing the pre-shRNA.
Currently, there is no such vaccine for COVID-19 although some are in clinical trials.
COVID-19 is the pandemic outbreak that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus from December, 2019.
In this article we are intended to propose a hypothesis on the development of a vaccine that is molecular in nature to work against COVID-19.
