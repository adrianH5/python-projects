NCBI database was used for the retrieval of Corona viruses (RdRp region) sequences.
The accession no MT042778 was used as query sequence in the NCBI Blast for obtaining highly similar sequence.
A cryo-EM structure of RdRp from SARs-CoV-2 was downloaded from RCSB using PDB ID: 6M71 [19].
The database of compounds from medicinal plants from Northern south Africa was retrieved from NANPDB (https://african-compounds.org/nanpdb/) [24].
This database is a diverse source of natural drugs from 617 source species, which comes from 146 families of plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi.
The database was then converted to.mdb format to be used as input for Molecular Operating Environment (MOE v2016) [25].
A cryo-EM structure of RdRp from SARs-CoV-2 was used to identify novel drugs from Northern South African medicinal compounds database (NANPDB) by using computational virtual screening and molecular docking approaches.
