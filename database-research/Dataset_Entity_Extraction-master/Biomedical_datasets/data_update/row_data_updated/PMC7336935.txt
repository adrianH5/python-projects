This emerging virus was later identified as coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 responsible on Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) [1,2].
Despite the fact that COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of April, the 8,844,171 confirmed cases with 465,460 confirmed deaths in a few months (December 8, 2019 to June 22, 2020) are terrifying.
The complete genomes were downloaded from the NCBI database.
Our genomic database contains in totally 22 species (Table 1).
Fig. 1.b shows an example of the CGR-centroid plot of each sub-region and the center of CGR (X) for COVID 19 after being partitioned into sub-regions of size 2 × 2.
Nucleotide sequences are converted into a numerical sequence (1D signals) before processing from our database extracted from NCBI platform.
The used methods are an alignment free method, requesting only a sequence database and a bioinformatics and signal processing knowledges [[16], [17], [18]].
Prior scientists searched the evolutionary history of the Wuhan COVID-19 virus [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],34,35].
Nevertheless, it was not clear, till now, if the COVID-19 arose from a recombination event or no between those viruses [12].
Others scientists suggested possible genesis of COVID-19 virus through recombination between Bat [10,11] and Pangolin coronaviruses [14,15].
Our results support this possibility of COVID-19 virus genesis though evolution of Bat and Pangolin coronaviruses by accumulation of point mutations and recombination.
