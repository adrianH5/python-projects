Selected sites are mapped onto the 3D structure of models obtained using SARS-CoV proteins as a templates (PDB ID: 6ACG for panel A, 2CJR for panel B, 2HSX for panel C).
These will need to be interpreted in the future, by incorporating epidemiological, biochemical, and additional genetic data.
Genome sequences were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (NCBI; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
The three-dimensional (3D) structures of SARS-CoV N (PDB identifier [ID]: 2CJR) (65) and S (PDB ID: 6ACG) (48) proteins were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
