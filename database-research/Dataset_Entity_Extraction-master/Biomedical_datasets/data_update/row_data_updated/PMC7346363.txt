Despite strict quarantine measures in Wuhan and surrounding areas, the virus, responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), rapidly spread across the globe, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
Soon after the emergence of the virus, a specific syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 was implemented in France.
Strengthened surveillance of COVID-19 cases was implemented in France on 10 January 2020, with the objective of identifying imported cases early to prevent secondary transmission in the community.
As the COVID-19 epidemic progressed in the country, the task of identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections was shared with the NRC-associated laboratory in Lyon and then extended to first line hospital laboratories in the whole country, with the NRC at Institut Pasteur focusing on the northern part of France, including the densely populated capital.
As the virus continued to spread, it became clear that COVID-19 patients could exhibit greatly variable clinical characteristics [4], including a proportion presenting with asymptomatic infection or mild disease [5].
We combined the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences generated here, including 97 from northern France and three from Algeria with recent history of travel to France, with 338 sequences published and freely available from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database and/or GenBank.
This dataset enabled to perform a phylogenetic analysis to gain more insight into the initial introductions and spread of the virus in France.
Our analysis indicates that the quarantine imposed on the initial imported COVID-19 cases, who were captured by the syndromic surveillance in France, appears to have prevented local transmission.
The first European cases, who were originally in ÃŽle-de-France (IDF) and who were previously described elsewhere [6], were direct imports from Hubei, China.
They were sampled on 24 January 2020 and the two derived respective viral genomes, IDF0372 and IDF0373, fall accordingly near the base of the tree, within clade V, according to GISAID nomenclature (Figure 2, Figure 3A).
The IDF0372 and IDF0373 genomes were identical and both harboured a G22661T non-synonymous mutation (V367F) in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, not observed in other genomes.
Similarly, IDF0515, obtained from a 29 January sample, corresponds to a traveller from Hubei, China.
This basal genome falls outside of the three major GISAID proposed clades V, G, and S (Figure 2), but carries the G11083T mutation associated with putative lineage V1 (Fig. S2), suggesting convergent evolution or a reversion of the V-clade defining G26144T change.
Several genomes correspond to patients in GE, Normandie (N), IDF, Hauts-de-France (HF) and B with recent history of travel in Europe (GE3067, N1620, IDF2792), United Arab Emirates (IDF2936), Madagascar (HF1993), Egypt (B1623, B2330) or linked to Paris airports (IDF1980).
Other sequences sampled weeks later (IDF2849, GE1973) are more basal to the clade, highlighting the complexity and risk of inferences based on 1 or 2 nucleotide substitutions.
Because of this, and the scarcity of early sequences in many countries in Europe, country and within-country level phylogeographic estimations are unreliable with the current dataset.
Crucially, while all early symptomatic suspected COVID-19 cases samples were sent to the NRC for testing, this was no longer the case as the epidemic developed (Figure 1A).
In addition, pauci- or asymptomatic cases are scarcely represented in our dataset.
