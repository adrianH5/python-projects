The genome (accession no. KP981644) is from the most virulent pantropic CCoV invading multiple canine organs (Buonavoglia et al.
The green arrow points to CCoV (accession KC175339 in the phylogeny) that had been propagated extensively in cell culture before sequencing.
There are two genomes sequenced for CRCoV (accession nos. JX860640 and KX432213).
3, genome accession KC175339).
The interpretation is further corroborated by a recent report that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients also suffer from digestive discomfort (Pan et al. 2020).
In a comprehensive study of the first 12 COVID-19 patients in the United States (Midgley and The COVID-19 Investigation Team, 2020), one patient reported diarrhea as the initial symptom before developing fever and cough (Midgley and The COVID-19 Investigation Team, 2020).
Stool samples from 7 out of 10 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 3 patients with diarrhea (Midgley and The COVID-19 Investigation Team, 2020), corroborating a previous report of SARS-CoV-2 detection in stool (Holshue et al. 2020).
In particular, live SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from stool of a COVID-19 patient (Zhang et al. 2020).
Nine SARS-CoV-2-like genomes have recently been isolated and sequenced from pangolin and deposited in GISAID database (gisaid.org).
The one with the highest sequence coverage (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_410721) has an ICpG value of 0.3929, close to the extreme low end of ICpG values observed among available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
