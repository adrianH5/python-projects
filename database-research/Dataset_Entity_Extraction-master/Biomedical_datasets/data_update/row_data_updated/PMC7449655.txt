Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has led to >22 million affected (1) and >784,000 deaths worldwide.
Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that inflammation associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a “COVID-19–related coagulopathy” (5), resulting in increased thrombosis (6).
Observational analyses have suggested potential benefit for in-hospital use of anticoagulation (AC) in COVID-19 treatment (9,10).
Survival in days was calculated as time from hospital admission to in-hospital death, discharge, or the date of dataset lock (May 7, 2020).
Overall, 1,073 (24.4%) patients died during the study period, 2,892 (65.9%) were discharged alive, and 424 (9.7%) were still hospitalized by dataset freeze date.
Autopsies were performed on COVID-19 positive patients at Mount Sinai Health System starting on March 20, 2020, with 72 completed by May 7, 2020 (8).
Thromboembolic disease has emerged as an important complication among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
The mechanisms by which thrombotic disease may occur in the setting of COVID-19 infection include inflammation, hypoxia, and potentially pharmacotherapeutic interactions (2,4,12,13).
As such, the potential benefit of AC in the treatment of COVID-19 is based on the prevention and treatment of microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis.
In our cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, a strong association of AC with approximately 50% reduced hazard of in-hospital mortality was observed (Figure 1A).
As mortality rates for patients with COVID-19 who undergo intubation for respiratory failure range from 30% to 80% (16, 17, 18), we analyzed the association between AC and intubation.
Background  Thromboembolic disease is common in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
Conclusions  AC was associated with lower mortality and intubation among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
