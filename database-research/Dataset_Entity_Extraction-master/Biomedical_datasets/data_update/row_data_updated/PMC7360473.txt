As of June 18, 2020, over 8.4 million cases and 450,000 deaths resulting from infection by a novel SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19), have now been confirmed worldwide; furthermore, there have been more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and over 110,000 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA alone [2].
Morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 rise dramatically with age and co-existing health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and while most infected individuals recover, even very young and otherwise healthy patients may unpredictably succumb to this disease [3].
These observations beg the question of how much of the variation in COVID-19 disease severity may be explained by genetic susceptibility.
Development of new preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 will be greatly facilitated by systematic identification of host genetic pathways and DNA polymorphisms (variants) which modulate the risk of infection and severe illness, including the overexuberant immune response to the virus that often portends a poor outcome.
Not only has the COVID-19 pandemic had huge health and economic impacts in 188 countries/regions across the world, but the disease has also struck in different racial/ethnic subpopulations.
Clinical studies have reported that incidence and mortality rates are significantly different between male and female COVID-19 patients, and the disease is associated with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders, in particular individuals with hypertension receiving anti-hypertensive medications [8].
Therefore, a systematic investigation of the functional polymorphisms in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 among different populations could pave the way for precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies for COVID-19.
Here, we investigated genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 by examining DNA polymorphisms in ACE2 (OMIM 300335) and TMPRSS2 (OMIM 602060) genes.
We assembled a total of 437 non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the protein-coding regions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1a) from three databases: (i) Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v3: gnomad.broadinstitute.org, covering 9 geographical areas), (ii) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP: evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), and (iii) 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP, www.internationalgenome.org).
We further inspected the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for ACE2 using the GTEx [13] and QTLbase [14] databases.
We found 6 germline deleterious variants (p.Val160Met, p.Gly181Arg, p.Arg240Cys, p.Gly259Ser, p.Pro335Leu, and p.Gly432Ala) in the TMPRSS2 coding region, which are also identified as somatic mutations occurring in different cancer types from TCGA and COSMIC databases (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic).
We further evaluated the eQTL profile of TMPRSS2 using the GTEx [13] and QTLbase databases [14] as well.
We found two eQTLs associated with TMPRSS2 non-synonymous SNPs (rs12329760 (encoding p.Val160Met), p = 4.54 × 10−5; rs75603675, p = 0.009) in the kidney and bone, respectively, using the QTLbase database [14], while there are no known eQTLs associated with TMPRSS2 non-synonymous SNPs from GTEx [13].
These unique but prevalent polymorphisms in TMPRSS2 offer potential explanations for differential genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as for risk factors, including those with cancer and the high-risk group of male patients.
Because TMPRSS2 is located on 21q22.3, we could speculate that individuals with Down syndrome would be at high risk for COVID-19 infection.
In addition, oncogenic roles of TMPRSS2 may be linked to poor outcomes with COVID-19 as well [16], which should be studied in the future.
This observation suggests that developmental regulation of TMPRSS2 may link the relative protection of infants and children from COVID-19.
There are currently no approved effective medications against COVID-19.
Several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19, but effective vaccines not likely to be available for many months.
Several potentially repurposable drugs (Fig. 2c), including melatonin [19], hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine, are under investigation for treatment of COVID-19 [20].
However, further pharmacogenomic studies that integrate drug response and genetic data from patients with COVID-19 are urgently needed.
Current analysis examined massive genomic data from general population, not COVID-19 patient-specific populations.
All genetic associations identified in current study are urgently needed to be tested in COVID-19 patients in the near future.
We anticipate that large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are urgently needed to identify likely causal host genetic risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes using genetic data from patients with COVID-19; such knowledge will improve risk stratification of individuals exposed to or testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and allow for precision medicine interventions for COVID-19.
A COVID-19 host genetics initiative is already underway to bring together the human genetics research community to generate, share, and analyze data in a search for the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and outcomes [27].
The first COVID-19 GWAS identified the 3p21.31 gene cluster (including SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1) as a genetic susceptibility locus in severe patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure [28].
Yet, our study aims to look for SNPs associated with disease severity of COVID-19, but not disease susceptibility.
In summary, systematic identification of the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and clinical outcome, including both virus and host factors (e.g., ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms), could guide personalized treatment in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic and even explain current epidemiologic observations (i.e., males, elderly at high risk, and clinical comorbidities) and natural history.
Background  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now been confirmed worldwide.
Yet, COVID-19 is strangely and tragically selective.
Morbidity and mortality due to COVID19 rise dramatically with age and co-existing health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
In this study, we investigated genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 by examining DNA polymorphisms in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (two key host factors of SARS-CoV-2) from ~ 81,000 human genomes.
Unique but prevalent polymorphisms (including p.Val160Met (rs12329760), an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)) in TMPRSS2 , offer potential explanations for differential genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as for risk factors, including those with cancer and the high-risk group of male patients.
We further discussed that polymorphisms in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 could guide effective treatments (i.e., hydroxychloroquine and camostat) for COVID-19.
This study suggested that ACE2 or TMPRSS2 DNA polymorphisms were likely associated with genetic susceptibility of COVID-19, which calls for a human genetics initiative for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
All population genetic data used in this study are free and available at three databases: (i) Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v3: gnomad.broadinstitute.org, covering 9 geographical areas), (ii) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP: evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), and (iii) 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP, www.internationalgenome.org).
