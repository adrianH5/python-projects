A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 capable to infect humans, emerged in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China, causing the novel disease COVID-19 (Wu et al., 2020).
A recent study which analyzed COVID-19 symptoms in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, reported that 50 (95% confidence intervals 29–70)% of the variance of ‘predicted COVID-19’ phenotype is due to genetic factors (Williams et al., 2020).
It has been shown that plasmin is also capable to cleave furin sites (Zhao et al., 2020) and that individuals with elevated plasmin demonstrated higher susceptibility to COVID-19 (Ji et al., 2020).
At the beginning of May 2020, in the full swing of COVID-19 pandemic, the data on genetic susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 which would be based on the genotyping of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking.
Furthermore, we can learn from clinical experiences of the SARS-CoV-2 infection which showed that plasmin and other airway proteases could also be important for patients experiencing more severe form of COVID-19 (Ji et al., 2020).
To systematically examine the coding variants in selected genes and differences in the allele frequency between populations, we performed comparative analysis of 22 variants found in FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes from Serbian population database with different European populations and super-populations extracted from 1kGP database (Genomes Project et al., 2015).
Having in mind that individuals with elevated plasmin had greater susceptibility to COVID-19 and more severe clinical manifestations (Ji et al., 2020), rare variants in PLG, such as p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val may be recognized as potential markers of inter-individual differences in susceptibility to coronavirus.
Having in mind the MAF difference between Spanish and East Asian populations, it would be interesting to further investigate whether it also reflects the remarkable differences in susceptibility and morbidity to COVID-19 between these populations.
While variant p.Gln293Arg was described as a cumulative risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Suo et al., 2019), its effect on the protease activity and COVID-19 susceptibility remains to be elucidated.
New coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is capable to infect humans and cause a novel disease COVID-19.
Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
