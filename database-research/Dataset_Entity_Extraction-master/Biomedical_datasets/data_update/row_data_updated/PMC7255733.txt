Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and identification of a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reports suggest the virus might be evolving, albeit at a lower rate than influenza viruses.1, 2, 3 Nevertheless, in light of the rapid and pandemic-scale spread of COVID-19, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 raise new diagnostic challenges, including the redesign of the oligonucleotide sequences in use in RT-qPCR assays to circumvent potential primerâ€“sample mismatches.
We report an analysis of all high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (1825 in total) deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database as of March 30, 2020.
Oligonucleotide optimisation will be facilitated by global sharing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and the frequently updated reports on sequence analysis that are available on the GISAID website.
