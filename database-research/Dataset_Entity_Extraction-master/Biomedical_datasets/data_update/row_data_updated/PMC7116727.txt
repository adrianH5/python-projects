For membrane fusion to occur–in comparison with other class-I fusion proteins and as described in coronavirus post-fusion structures– the S2 component is likely to undergo a major helical rearrangement, in which the long trimer interface helix (spanning residues 990–1035) grows and extends, by incorporating the refolded turn and helix from the N-terminal portion of HR1, and projects the fusion peptide towards the host cell membrane.
