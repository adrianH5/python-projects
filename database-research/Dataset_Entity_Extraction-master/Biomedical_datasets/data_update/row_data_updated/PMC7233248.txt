The end of 2019 marked the beginning of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic [1].
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2).
The Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database [8] has provided data on variations in the WHO-recommended primer binding regions for the SARS-CoV-2 genomes [9] with the so-called Charité primers situated in the most conserved regions and the China-CDC primers in variable sites.
Most of the COVID-19 cases reported in Nepal have been traced back to Nepalese migrating from India during the pandemic (Supplementary Table 1).
We analysed primer and probe binding sites in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 deposited in the GISAID originating from Indian labs.
Genomic sequence data for all Indian SARS-CoV-2 samples collected on or before 29 March 2020 were recovered from the GISAID database on 7 May 2020.
We sincerely want to avoid any misinterpretations that may arise based on the content of this letter with respect to the Indian origin of COVID-19 patients in Nepal.
We would like to thank Dr. Shravan Kumar Mishra, NPHL (Nepal), for describing the more recent use of COVID-19 diagnostic kits in NPHL.
Our sincere gratitude goes to all the scientists and submitting laboratories (Supplementary Acknowledgement Table 2) involved in collection, processing and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 sequences as well as the meta-data in GISAID without which this work could not have been done.
Most of the COVID-19 cases in Nepal are in the Southern districts of Nepal bordering India with travel histories to India.    •
Very few positive cases of COVID-19 are detected in Nepal which could either be due to early national lockdown.
Whole genomes of 93 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients were analyzed to find the primer and probe binding sites.
