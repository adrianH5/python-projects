The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated need for vital social practices that reduce further spread have disrupted clinical research functions worldwide [1].
Ironically, this interruption coincides with an especially critical need for human biospecimen research to better understand the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the pathology of COVID-19.
Building a COVID-19 biorepository is a delicate and complex task that requires maximum biosafety measures and minimum interruption in an overburdened clinical delivery system.
We also feature the earliest outcome of this pipeline, which is the recently reported genomic characterization linking the US and European viral strains, a crucial development in our efforts to combat COVID-19 [3].
The CBRD adheres to all biosafety level-3 guidelines for COVID-19 collections as outlined by the Center for Disease Control [4].
To maximize COVID-19 collections, we modified this protocol to prospectively enroll all patients presenting to NYULH with a COVID-19 nasopharyngeal diagnostic test performed into Labvantage.
The clinical information from enrolled patients is extracted from the electronic medical record and recorded in 107 discrete demographic, medical, and COVID-19-specific data fields (Additional file 1: Appendix S1) in a REDCap [5] database.
The protocol for COVID-19 biospecimen collections for research at NYULH minimizes interruptions in the delivery of care, includes vital biosafety measures, and maximizes the research potential for banked COVID-19 biospecimens (Fig.Â 1).
NYULH saw its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 11, 2020.
In accordance with national and international policies, the IRB approved a waiver of consent to permit COVID-19 biospecimen collection on March 28, 2020.
Of the first 11,120 patients accrued to the COVID-19 database, 4267 (38.4%) tested positive and approximately 10% required hospitalization.
We therefore suggest establishing a main biorepository with institutional governance for all patients tested for COVID-19.
The creation of this resource at NYULH has enriched the community with high-quality patient-linked COVID-19 specimens, which has already contributed to novel findings about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology [3].
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and consequent social distancing practices have disrupted essential clinical research functions worldwide.
Ironically, this coincides with an immediate need for research to comprehend the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the pathology of COVID-19.
However, building a COVID-19 biorepository amidst the active pandemic is a complex and delicate task.
Using an amended institutional biobanking protocol, these efforts led to accrual of 11,120 patients presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing, 4267 (38.4%) of whom tested positive for COVID-19.
