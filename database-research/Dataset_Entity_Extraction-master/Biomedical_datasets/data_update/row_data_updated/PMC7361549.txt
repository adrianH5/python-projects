Individuals infected with SARS‐CoV‐19 have a variety of clinical manifestations of the disease described as COVID‐19 (Huang et al., 2020).
While almost all patients develop COVID pneumonia, approximately 29% cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome which occurs 10–12 days after the onset of symptoms (Huang et al., 2020).
The upregulation of HLA‐DR expression in lung tissue of patients affected with COVID pneumonia (Wang et al., 2020) suggests that this process is instrumental in the immunological control of the disease process and therefore must be considered to be biologically relevant.
It could be argued that the use of the UK deceased donors as a control population in this study has simply highlighted more frequent occurrence of antigens common to BAME communities in our COVID‐19 population requiring hospital support for their disease.
HLA‐DRB1*10 and A*26 are common within all European subregions (Sanchez‐Mazas et al., 2017) and offer an independent mechanistic explanation for severity of clinical disease in COVID‐19 patients which is independent of skin colour or other immunogenetic variation due to heritage.
