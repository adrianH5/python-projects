The amino acid sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 genome–associated proteins, that is, ORF1ab (which is a complex of the following proteins: 5′‐untranslated region, nsp‐2, nsp‐3, nsp‐4, 3C‐like protease, nsp‐6, nsp‐7, nsp‐8, nsp‐9, nsp‐10, RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase [nsp‐12], helicase [nsp13], 3′‐5′ exonuclease [nsp‐14], endoRNase [nsp‐15], and o‐ribose methyltransferase [nsp‐16]), surface glycoprotein “S,” ORF‐3a, Envelope protein “E,” Membrane glycoprotein “M,” ORF‐6, ORF‐7, ORF‐8, Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein “N” and ORF‐10, were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database.
Both the servers are recently updated versions over previously used CD4 epitope prediction servers with improved accuracy, trained on extended datasets.
The tertiary structure of Toll‐like receptor 3 (TLR‐3) was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank with ID: 2A0Z.
