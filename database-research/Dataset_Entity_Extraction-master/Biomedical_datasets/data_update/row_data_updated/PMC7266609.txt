Each week a sequence data cutoff is applied across the consortium to give a defined dataset for weekly analysis to report to SAGE, initially focusing on: (1) local transmission versus imported cases, (2) rates of epidemic growth,5, 6 (3) reconstructing spatial movement, (4) chains of transmission, (5) observed genetic changes, and (6) identification of genomic changes potentially affecting common diagnostic tests or direct (eg, chemotherapeutics) or indirect therapies.
