The first week in the pre‐COVID‐19 era was randomly selected, while the second was chosen during the actual COVID‐19 emergency.
The week between 21 October 2019 and 26 October 2019 was identified as the pre‐COVID‐19 (no closure of the outpatients' surgeries available in our Unit for holidays or meetings).
The days between 12 March 2020 and 18 March 2020 characterized the weekly activity of our emergency service during the COVID‐19 era (days in the run‐up to the Government decree‐law).
In the pre‐COVID‐19 era, 106 patients accessed our emergency outpatients' room, whereas just 20 cases were examined after the emergency decree‐law.
The number of unjustified accesses was 60 in pre‐COVID era, and 46 patients showed ‘true’ emergencies.
The misuse of the emergency consultation facility is a bad habit and it has been estimated that at least half of the patients do not have a ‘true’ emergency (range 49–82%),

 which is confirmed by our study (60 vs. five unjustified accesses, before/after the COVID‐19 pandemic).
Patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction will refer to the ES even in the COVID‐19 era, and the same will occur in the case of dermatological emergencies.
A possible bias in our research may be due to the panic related to the COVID‐19 disease, which can explain the drop in the number of consultations (106 vs. 19, for an 81% reduction).
