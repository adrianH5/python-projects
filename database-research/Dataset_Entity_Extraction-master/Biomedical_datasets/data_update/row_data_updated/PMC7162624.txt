Staff shortages in health care are significant amidst the global effort against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The number of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 is significant.
In a study of COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 328 of the 634 positive cases (51Â·7%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Furthermore, evidence from modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profiles suggests that 44% of secondary cases were infected during the presymptomatic phase of illnesses from index cases, whereas a study of COVID-19 cases in a homeless shelter in Boston, MA, USA, implies that individual COVID-19 symptoms might be uncommon and proposed universal testing irrespective of symptomatic burden.
Substantial asymptomatic transmission might also mean that current estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, for COVID-19 are inaccurate.
This disease spread could, in turn, propagate out of hospitals: during a period of lockdown asymptomatic COVID-19 carriage among hospital staff could conceivably act as a potent source of ongoing transmission.
The scale of this problem is not yet fully understood, nor is the full potential for asymptomatic and presymptomatic HCWs to transmit infection to patients who do not have COVID-19, other HCWs, or the public.
In partnership with the Francis Crick Institute in London, UK, where COVID-19 testing will be performed, this initiative is an attempt to further limit nosocomial transmission.
A healthy, COVID-19-free workforce that is not burned out will be an asset to the prolonged response to the COVID-19 crisis.
This approach could mean that presymptomatic HCWs who are capable of transmitting the virus are not being tested; if they were tested and found to be COVID-19 positive, they could be advised to isolate and await the onset of symptoms or, if no symptoms develop, undergo repeat testing.
