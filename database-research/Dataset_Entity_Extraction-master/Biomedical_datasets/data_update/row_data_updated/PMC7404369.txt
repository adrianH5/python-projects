Early reports from these institutions showed that severe kidney disease is a hallmark of severe COVID disease.
Their finding could offer confirmatory evidence that direct renal infection occurs in the setting of AKI in COVID‐19.
The authors found that collapsing glomerulopathy in black patients with COVID‐19 was associated with high‐risk APOL1 variants.
Given this entity's resemblance with HIV‐associated nephropathy, the authors proposed the term COVID‐19‐associated nephropathy to describe the condition.
COVID‐19 is recent and, therefore, case records are common and valuable.
These states‐of‐affairs confront nephrologists and intensivists in the COVID‐19 pandemic, in less fortunate clinical settings, all the more so.
Since COVID‐19 has afflicted many patients, AKI patient series have been collected.
They found that the available limited published data to indicate that severe AKI in patients with COVID‐19 is an ominous clinical predictor and is associated with high mortality (no surprise here).
They were at least able to determine an incidence AKI rate of 10% in COVID‐19 patients, albeit the range in their series was huge (so as not to be helpful).
We cannot determine a specific form of COVID‐19 AKI or chronic nephropathy.
Her physicians considered the diagnosis of COVID‐10 disease that was confirmed.
Cassol et al have recently counselled for caution in interpreting these findings (Preprint https://doi.org/10.34067/KID.0002692020).
In contrast to the AIDS epidemic (largely ignored for decades), SARS‐Co‐V2 received immediate attention, in terms of genomic sequencing, assay development, sharing of diagnostic data, vaccine development and other international cooperation.
We, (Covid‐19 Charité investigators) are conducting a prospective investigation that includes incorporation of recent “biomarkers” for AKI in a patient population likely to need them.
