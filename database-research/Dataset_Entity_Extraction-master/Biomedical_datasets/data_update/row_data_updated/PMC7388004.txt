Alternatively, with prolonged waiting times until results are available, viral replication may be measured by determining the RNA or infectious titers of progeny virus released from infected cells by RT-qPCR (Chu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Yao et al., 2020), or tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) endpoint titrations (Chin et al., 2020; Manenti et al., 2020) and plaque assays (Keil et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020a), respectively.
It can be used to measure the TCID50, to screen for antivirals, and to determine antiviral potencies of drugs (as inhibitory concentration 50), neutralizing sera or antibodies in a timely and cost-effective manner, within only two days.
Two SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, Vero E6 (African green monkey epithelial kidney cells) and Caco-2 (heterogeneous human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells), were seeded in 96 well plates and inoculated with increasing multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from France (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020).
The antibody-targeted S2 domain is generally conserved between SARS-CoV-2 strains (Ng et al., 2014; Walls et al., 2020) (www.nextstrain.org (Hadfield et al., 2018)) which allows detection of the S protein of the France/IDF0372/2020 as well as the Netherlands/01 isolate and two isolates from Ulm, Southern Germany (Fig. S1).
We were wondering whether this high sensitivity and ease of quantitation may also allow to determine the TCID50 of virus stocks, that is usually done on Vero E6 cells by manually counting infected wells using a microscope.
The subsequent calculation of TCID50/ml by Reed and Muench revealed exactly the same viral titer for the in-cell ELISA (Fig. 4b) as for microscopic evaluation (Fig. 4a) showing that the established ELISA is suitable for determination of viral titers.
As shown in Fig. 6
, the two control sera, that were obtained before the COVID-19 outbreak or shown to contain no SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins, did not affect infection.
In contrast, both COVID-19 sera neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 6).
These titers corresponded well to the presence of immunoglobulins which suggests that the here established method can be used to detect and quantify the neutralizing capacities of sera from COVID-19 patients.
Additionally, the assay can be applied to detect and quantify titers of neutralizing sera of COVID-19 patients, all within only 2 days.
We found that the in-cell ELISA allows to i) discriminate infected from uninfected wells, and ii) even after infection with very low MOIs (as low as 0.000005, which corresponds to one virion per three wells) at 4 days post infection (Fig. 4), representing an alternative for non-biased determining the TCID50 without the need of counting infected wells or plaques.
The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology.
Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID 50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC 50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera.
