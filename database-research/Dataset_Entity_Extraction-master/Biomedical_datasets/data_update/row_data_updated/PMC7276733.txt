At the time of writing, the outbreak of the highly infectious novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has swept across all five continents, with >4 million confirmed cases globally (9 May 2020).
Patients felt to be at risk can then be identified early and appropriate referral either to a dedicated area for further assessment or to an acute care/COVID‐19 assessment centre can be facilitated.
Patients and their caregivers should be reminded of the signs and symptoms of COVID‐19, as well as the importance of hand hygiene and other infection control measures.
Minimising immunosuppressive therapy, wherever possible, has become a key strategy in the face of COVID‐19.
For those patients in whom proceeding with ASCT has been deemed absolutely necessary, increased vigilance will be required in the short‐ and longer‐term, given the increased susceptibility to viral infection that will persist beyond the initial post‐transplant period.

 Until herd immunity is established, the threat of COVID‐19 infection for this at‐risk population will very likely persist beyond the immediate crisis and may change our recommendations for surveillance and prevention in the post‐transplant period indefinitely.
The very real risk of hospitalisation posed by COVID‐19 has increasingly motivated both patients and treating physicians to actively engage in conversations regarding advance directives, goals of care and end‐of‐life planning, and to document these clearly.

Despite the fact that at the time of writing there are >3000 published articles on COVID‐19, the data on the true risk posed by this virus to patients with myeloma remain immature.
However, there are early suggestions that certain agents used in the treatment of myeloma could be useful against COVID‐19, including selinexor and ixazomib.

 Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co‐receptor for COVID‐19, but it remains unclear whether angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or receptor blockers, which are commonly co‐prescribed for patients with myeloma, could either aggravate or ameliorate the disease.

One myeloma physician has suggested things will now be considered in terms of whether they were ‘BC’ (Before COVID‐19) or ‘AC’ (After COVID‐19).
A global recession in the wake of COVID‐19 seems undeniable and will undoubtedly have a significant impact on healthcare spending regardless of the underlying revenue source and infrastructure.
At the time of writing, estimates suggest that in the USA alone, unemployment resulting from the COVID‐19 pandemic could reach levels of to 52·8 million, more than three‐times worse than the peak of the Great Recession.
Immediate focus is minimising risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and the sequelae of infection.
Healthcare delivery post‐COVID‐19 will not return to how it was, and now is the time to invest in novel strategies to deliver the best possible outcomes for patients.
