As of 28 January 2020, 33 genomes of 2019‐nCoV obtained from humans have been released on GISAID (http://gisaid.org/).
The final dataset (“dataset_32”) included 32 genomes of 2019‐nCoV from China (n = 25), Thailand (n = 2), and USA (n = 5), with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020.
For this dataset, the 2019‐nCoV genomes were aligned using MAFFT v7.222
 and then manually curated using BioEdit v7.2.5.
In addition, we subsampled three other datasets, that is, “dataset_14” collected between 24 December 2019 and 1 January 2020, comprising 14 genomes from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; “dataset_24” collected between 24 December 2019 and 18 January 2020, comprising 24 genomes from China and Thailand; and “dataset_30” collected between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020, comprising 30 genomes from China, Thailand, and USA.
To assess the recombination for the full dataset (ie, “dataset_32”), we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1.
The best‐fit nucleotide substitution model for “dataset_32” was identified according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), small‐sample corrected AIC (AICc), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and performance‐based decision theory (DT) method with 3 (24 candidate models) or 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.10.
To evaluate the phylogenetic signals of the datasets, we performed likelihood‐mapping analysis
 using TREE‐PUZZLE v5.3,
 with 35 000 to 80 000 randomly chosen quartets for the four datasets.
For each dataset, we employed HKY, as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model to estimate the time to a most recent common ancestor (TMRCA).
We then used two schemes to set the time scale prior for each dataset, that is, constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior (mean = 1.0 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year; 95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 1.854 × 10−4‐4 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter based on previous studies
, 
, 
 and the tip‐dating method, for which the evolutionary rate for each dataset was also estimated.
The HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (http://www.hivtrace.org)
 was employed to infer transmission network clusters for the full dataset (ie, “dataset_32”).
For “dataset_32”, the HKY model provided the best fit across the four different methods (ie, AIC, AICc, BIC, and DT) and two different substitution schemes (ie, 24 and 88 candidate models), and was thus used in subsequent likelihood‐mapping and phylogenetic analyses for the four datasets.
The PHI test of “dataset_32” did not find statistically significant evidence for recombination (P = 1.0).
Likelihood‐mapping analysis of “dataset_14” revealed that 100% of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong star‐like topology signal reflecting a novel virus, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread (Figure 1A).
Likewise, 91.9%, 81.8%, and 74.7% of the quartets from “dataset_24,” “dataset_30,” and “dataset_32,” respectively, were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating relatively more phylogenetic signals as additional sequences were analyzed over time (Figure 1B‐D).
ML phylogenetic analysis of the four datasets also showed star‐like topologies, in accordance with the likelihood‐mapping results (Figure 2).
Root‐to‐tip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best‐fitting root showed that “dataset_14” had a relatively strong positive temporal signal (R
2 = .2967; correlation coefficient = .5446) (Figure 3A).
In contrast, “dataset_24” had a minor negative temporal signal (R
2 = 4.4428 × 10−2; correlation coefficient = −.2108) (Figure 3B); whereas, “dataset_30” and “dataset_32” both had minor positive temporal signals (R
2 = 1.2155 × 10−2; correlation coefficient = .1102 and R
2 = 1.1506 × 10−2; correlation coefficient = .1073) (Figure 3C,D).
On the basis of Bayesian time‐scaled phylogenetic analysis using the constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior (mean = 1.0 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854 × 10−4‐4 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter, we estimated the TMRCA dates for 2019‐nCoV from the four datasets, that is, 1 November 2019 (95% BCI: 21 July 2019 and 29 December 2019), 10 November 2019 (95% BCI: 16 July 2019 and 16 January 2020), 21 October 2019 (95% BCI: 20 May 2019 and 19 January 2020), and 15 October 2019 (95% BCI: 2 May 2019 and 17 January 2020) for “dataset_14,” “dataset_24,” “dataset_30,” and “dataset_32,” respectively (Table 1).
Furthermore, based on Bayesian time‐scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip‐dating method, we also estimated the TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates from “dataset_30” and “dataset_32,” with resulting showing 6 December 2019 (95% BCI: 16 November 2019 and 22 December 2019) and 6 December 2019 (95% BCI: 16 November 2019 and 21 December 2019), respectively; and 1.7926 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 7.216 × 10−4‐3.0558 × 10−3) and 1.8266 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 7.5813 × 10−4‐3.0883 × 10−3), respectively (Table 1).
Due to poor convergence in the MCMC chains, we did not obtain the TMRCA date and evolutionary rate from “dataset_14” and “dataset_24.”
This allowed us to identify a single large transmission cluster that included 30 of 32 (93.75%) genomes, thus suggesting low genetic divergence for “dataset_32” (Figure 6A).
This allowed us to identify three transmission clusters that included 15 of 32 (46.875%) genomes for “dataset_32” (Figure 6B).
On the basis of “dataset_32,” which included 32 genomes of 2019‐nCoV strains sampled from China (Wuhan, n = 14; Shenzhen, n = 6; Zhuhai, n = 2; Hangzhou, n = 2; Taiwan, n = 1), Thailand (n = 2), and USA (n = 5) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020, and subsampled “dataset_14,” “dataset_24,” and “dataset_30,” which included 14, 24, and 30 2019‐nCoV strain genomes, respectively, our likelihood‐mapping analysis confirmed additional tree‐like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time, thus indicating increasing genetic divergence of 2019‐nCoV in human hosts (Figure 1).
Of note, the strong star‐like signal (100% of quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle) from “dataset_14” at the beginning of the virus outbreak suggests that 2019‐nCoV initially exhibited low genetic divergence, with recent and rapid human‐to‐human transmission.
This result is consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from “dataset_14” (Figure 2A).
The genetic divergence from “dataset_32” and “dataset_30” was higher than that for “dataset_14,” but still demonstrated minor temporal signals (Figure 3).
Using the constrained evolutionary rate method, the mean TMRCA dates for 2019‐nCoV based on the four datasets ranged from 15 October to 10 November 2019, when using a lognormal prior (mean = 1.0 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854 × 10−4‐4 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter (Table 1).
Using the tip‐dating method, the mean TMRCA date and evolutionary rate for 2019‐nCoV based on the “dataset_30” and “dataset_32” ranged from 16 November to 22 December 2019 and from 1.7926 × 10−3 to 1.8266 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year, respectively (Table 1).
