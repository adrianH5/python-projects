In the same context, the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV 2 (the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)) in December 2019 has inflicted 204 nations, with a total of 896,450 confirmed cases and 45,526 deaths up to 2 April 2020.
From a structural perspective, the genome of coronaviruses encodes four structural proteins: E (envelope protein, the smallest in size, expressed in abundance inside infected cells during the replication cycle but only partially incorporated into the virion envelope) [8], M (matrix glycoprotein, responsible for the assembly of virions [1,9] and interacting with S proteins, promoting their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)â€“Golgi intermediate for their incorporation into new virions) [10], N (nucleocapsid protein, the only protein capable of binding to the virus RNA genome, synthesizing nucleocapsid) [11], S (spike protein, mediating the attachment of the virus to host cell receptors) [12,13,14].
TMPRSS2 expression and variants served as COVID-19 modulators in Italian patients [31].
Alignment of the template (PDB ID: 5CE1) and the target protein is shown in Figure 1C.
Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) is a freely accessible database containing 30,927 natural compounds classified into 18 different superclasses, which include alkaloids and derivatives, lipids and lipid-like molecules, benzenoids, lignans, neolignans and associated compounds, and so on [32].
In silico screening of large databases is a cost-effective and time-saving approach towards drug discovery.
NPASS, a freely accessible database containing 30,927 compounds, was used to mine the potent inhibitors.
We screened the Natural Product Activity and Species Source database (NPASS, available at http://bidd2.nus.edu.sg/NPASS) which contains 30,927 compounds [32].
Based on a report that TMPRSS2 mutation makes some individuals more susceptible to COVID-19, a reported mutation V160M suggestive of changed disease susceptibility [31] was studied with respect to its docking conformation in the presence of the top compound.
To date, there is no specific drug registered to combat the disease it causes, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Further in vitro and in vivo validation is needed to study and develop an anti-COVID-19 drug based on the structures of the most promising compounds identified in this study.
