The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has caused over 15 million reported cases worldwide and over 600,000 deaths as of July 2020, also contains the heavily glycosylated surface glycoprotein spike (S) protein.
Because no vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for COVID-19, studies of SARS-CoV-2 as a prime target for anti-viral lectins, especially those that bind to complex-type N-glycans, are of special interest and substantial importance.
The 50% infective dose (TCID50) and immunoplaque assay (PFU/ml) of viruses in MDCK or Vero E6 cells were determined beforehand.
These findings suggest a potential application of FRIL for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza and COVID-19.
