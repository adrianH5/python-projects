Infectious virus titers ranged from 100.75 to 102.75 TCID50/ml (median tissue culture infectious dose per ml) in the donor ferrets, from 100.75 to 103.5 TCID50/ml in the direct contact ferrets and from 100.75 to 104.25 TCID50/ml in the indirect recipient ferrets.
Four donor ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 6 × 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 virus diluted in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (250 μl instilled dropwise in each nostril) and were housed individually in a cage.
