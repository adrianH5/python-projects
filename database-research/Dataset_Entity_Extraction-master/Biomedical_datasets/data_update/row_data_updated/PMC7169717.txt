The viral load was expressed as the equivalent of log10 equivalents per mL (TCID50eq/mL) and compared to that of the pre‐treatment sample.
Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the mean is reported as TCID50eq/mL.
As shown in Table 2, positive controls and pre‐treatment samples from all units had a log10 TCID50eq/mL equivalent to the infectious viral titre determined by plaque assay as shown in Table 1.
