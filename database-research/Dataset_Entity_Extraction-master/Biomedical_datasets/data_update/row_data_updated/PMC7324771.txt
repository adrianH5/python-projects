It was therefore termed SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes was named COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) [3].
Several real time RT-PCR assays protocols for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been developed and approved from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Nucleic acid in US and are now widely employed to diagnose COVID-19 disease [7, 8].
Moreover, recent meta-analysis on 4243 COVID-19 patients reported that stool samples from 48.1% of patients tested positive for virus RNA, among these patients 70.3% tested positive for RNA virus even after respiratory specimens tested negative [11].
Between March 4 and April 20, 2020, we collected every 5â€‰days respiratory and fecal specimens from fifteen COVID-19 patients.
We selected 15 positive novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients with mild or no symptom.
