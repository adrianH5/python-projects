Identifying the first introduction of the virus is of epidemiological interest, for the tracking and mapping of COVID-19 spread in a country.
In Italy, and elsewhere, there have been speculations to the effect that COVID-19 had been silently circulating before the first case was identified.
In France, where the COVID-19 epidemic was believed to have started in late January 2020, a retrospective analysis of a stored respiratory sample from a patient hospitalised in December 2019, demonstrated that the patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that, in France, the epidemic started much earlier than previously thought (Deslandes et al., 2020).
It is known that gastrointestinal symptoms are seen in patients with COVID-19 (between 16% to 33% in most studies), and that approximately 50% of patients with COVID-19 have detectable virus in their stool (Ouali et al., 2020).
The viral load in the faeces of COVID-19 patients was estimated between 103 and 107 copies/mL, depending on the infection course (reviewed in Foladori et al., 2020).
Sequences were submitted to NCBI GenBank with the following accession numbers: MT843229-MT843240.
A sustained local transmission has been documented, so that by 11th August 2020, 250.973 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed, with 35.6441 deaths (https://www.epicentro.iss.it/en/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-dashboard).
As far as we know, COVID-19 first affected Lombardy and Veneto and, later on, all the other regions of Italy.
A genomic characterisation and phylogenetic analysis performed on complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients involved in the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardy, suggested that SARS-CoV-2 entered Northern Italy weeks before the first reported case of infection (Zehender et al., 2020).
Therefore, after mid-December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 had already been circulating in major urban centres surrounding the area (Codogno, in the province of Lodi) where the first case of COVID-19 was reported in February 2020.
Significantly, all of these regions documented COVID-19 cases starting from 25th February (Protezione Civile, 2020).
Considering the incubation period of COVID-19 - 6.4Â days on average (Wang et al., 2020) - as well as evidence showing that viral shedding may occur in asymptomatic patients (Jiang et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020), it is conceivable that the virus was circulating and being released into the sewage in the Paris area roughly at the same time as in northern Italy, as indicated by our positive sewage samples.
A Spanish study in the region of Murcia detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater before the first COVID-19 cases were declared by the local authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled (Randazzo et al., 2020), revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA before the first cases were reported.
The hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 circulation before the identification of the first clinical cases is supported by other epidemiological approaches as well: a seroprevalence study, conducted on healthy blood donors in the province of Milan during the COVID-19 epidemic showed that, between 12 and 17 February 2020, 2.0% of donors displayed IgG for SARS-CoV-2 (Percivalle et al., 2020).
Recently, van Dorp and co-workers analysed the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the global population since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes covering a vast geographical area (van Dorp et al., 2020).
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease COVID-19, a public health emergency worldwide, and Italy is among the most severely affected countries.
The first autochthonous Italian case of COVID-19 was documented on February 21, 2020.
