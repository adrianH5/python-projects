In early March 2020, the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) contained a compilation of 253 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) complete and partial genomes contributed by clinicians and researchers from across the world since December 2019.
The Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) was founded in 2006, and, since 2010, has been hosted by the German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection.
GISAID has also become a coronavirus repository since December 2019.
As of 4 March 2020, the cutoff point for our phylogenetic analysis, the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) had compiled 254 coronavirus genomes, isolated from 244 humans, nine Chinese pangolins, and one bat Rhinolophus affinis (BatCoVRaTG13 from Yunnan Province, China).
The network faithfully traces routes of infections for documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, indicating that phylogenetic networks can likewise be successfully used to help trace undocumented COVID-19 infection sources, which can then be quarantined to prevent recurrent spread of the disease worldwide.
