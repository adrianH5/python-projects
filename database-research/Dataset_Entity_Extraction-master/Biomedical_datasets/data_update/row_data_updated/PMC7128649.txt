During the submission process of this manuscript, the crystal structure of 2019-nCoV Mpro was solved (PDB ID: 6LU7), of which the lopinavir/ritonavir binding pocket region is nearly identical to our predicted model (Fig.Â S1).
Based on these results, we performed virtual docking to screen for commercial medicines in the DrugBank database that could bind to the above mentioned pocket site of 2019-nCoV Mpro, and identified 10 candidate clinical medicines (Table 1
; Figs. 1B and S3).
