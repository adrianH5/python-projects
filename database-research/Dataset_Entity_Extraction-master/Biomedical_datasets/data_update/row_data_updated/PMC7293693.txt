There is obvious interest in gaining insights into the epidemiology and evolution of the virus that has recently emerged in humans as the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
This is particularly true for the work of Forster et al., since their findings are based on a nonrepresentative dataset of 160 genomes, with no significant correlation between prevalence of confirmed cases and number of sequenced strains per country (7, 8).
The essential role of representative sampling is well documented in the literature (9), but was not acknowledged by the authors, who, instead, claim that their “network faithfully traces routes of infections for documented [COVID-19] cases,” without taking into consideration missing viral diversity, or evaluating multiple transmission hypotheses that would be consistent with sequence data, or even providing any support on the robustness of the branching pattern in their network.
