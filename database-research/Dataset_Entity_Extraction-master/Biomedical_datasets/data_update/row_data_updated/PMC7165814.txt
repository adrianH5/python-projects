After only 2 months, the epidemic of COVID‐19 is already larger than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) outbreak, which during 2002/2003 lasted 8 months and infected 8096 people, with a mortality rate of 9·5%.
This lack of homologous DNA sequences was a bit surprising, as Lu et al. (12) recently published a phylogenetic tree based on 50 genome sequences (including 10 2019_nCoV isolates) with high bootstrap values, which can only be obtained with sufficient degrees of conservation between members of the data set.
However, the database is highly biased towards particular bat species that were specifically sampled in search of the source of SARS.
