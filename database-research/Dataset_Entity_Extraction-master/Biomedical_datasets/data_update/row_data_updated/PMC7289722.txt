According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) has been diagnosed in over 6,057,853 people from more than 200 countries or territories and caused over 371,166 deaths worldwide as of 1 June 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a).
Therefore, the QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 assay remains highly specific and sensitive against SARS-CoV-2 even in light of genomic variations from the first five months of the COVID-19 outbreak (Visseaux et al., 2020).
As of week 21, 2020, the complete set of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID and GenBank databases were used in this study.
