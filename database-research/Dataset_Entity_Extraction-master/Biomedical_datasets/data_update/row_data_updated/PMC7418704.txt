Analysis of binding to dimeric human ACE2, incorporating avidity effects, was also analyzed for the RBDs that did not bind monomeric ACE2 (D-F, right).
To assess the phenotypic impacts of mutations that have appeared in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to date, we downloaded all 31,570 spike sequences available from GISAID (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017) on May 27, 2020 and identified RBD amino acid mutations present in high-quality clinical isolates.
For each threshold of GISAID observation counts, 1 million random sub-samples of single-nucleotide-accessible amino acid changes were generated at the same sample size as the true mutation set (n = 98, 42, and 13 for the ≥ 1, ≥ 2, and ≥ 6 thresholds).
A P-value was determined as the fraction of sub-samples with median mutational effect on binding or expression equal to or greater than that of the actual GISAID mutation set (dashed vertical line).
The observation that the set of mutations observed in GISAID have a more favorable median mutational effect on binding and expression than randomly sampled mutations indicates the action of purifying selection for ACE2 binding and RBD stability.
Random sub-samples were generated as in (B), and the maximum affinity-enhancing effect of mutations in each sub-sample was compared to that in the actual GISAID mutation set.
A P-value was determined as the fraction of sub-samples with a maximum effect on binding equal to or greater than in the actual GISAID mutation set (vertical dashed line).
We do not see evidence for selection for enhanced ACE2 binding, as randomly sampled mutations generally contain mutations with stronger affinity-enhancing effects than observed in the GISAID mutation set.
Last, we validated our deep mutational scanning for mutations that are especially prevalent among naturally occurring sequences in GISAID.
The Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2 (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank : MN908947, residues N331-T531) and additional sarbecovirus homologs (RaTG13, GenBank: MN996532; GD-Pangolin consensus from Lam et al. (2020); SARS-CoV-1 Urbani, GenBank: AY278741; WIV1, GenBank: KF367457 (identical RBD sequence to WIV16); LYRa11, GenBank: KF569996; Rp3, GenBank: DQ071615; HKU3-1, GenBank: DQ022305; Rf1, GenBank: DQ412042; ZXC21, GenBank: MG772934; ZC45, GenBank: MG772933; and BM48-31, GenBank: NC014470) were ordered as yeast codon-optimized gBlocks (IDT) and cloned into the pETcon yeast surface-display expression vector.
All 31,570 spike sequences on GISAID as of 27 May 2020 were downloaded and aligned via mafft (Katoh and Standley, 2013).
All amino-acid mutations among GISAID sequences were enumerated.
We excluded any mutation from our curated set of GISAID mutations if it was solely observed on sequence backgrounds containing at least one undetermined X character in the RBD sequence; however, sequences with X characters were allowed to contribute to observations of mutation count for mutations that were observed on at least one other high-coverage RBD sequence.
To characterize patterns of selection on amino-acid mutations observed among GISAID sequences, we conducted permutation tests as described in the Figure S7 legend.
We acknowledge all GISAID contributors for their sharing of sequencing data (https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/blob/master/data/alignments/Spike_GISAID/gisaid_hcov-19_acknowledgement_table.xls).
The full sequence of this plasmid is available at https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/blob/master/data/plasmid_maps/2736_HDM_IDTSpike_EcoKozak.gb.
We present an interactive visualization and open analysis pipeline to facilitate use of our dataset for vaccine design and functional annotation of mutations observed during viral surveillance.
The work identifies structurally constrained regions of the spike RBD that would be ideal targets for COVID-19 countermeasures and demonstrates that mutations in the virus that enhance ACE2 affinity can be engineered but have not, to date, been naturally selected during the pandemic.
