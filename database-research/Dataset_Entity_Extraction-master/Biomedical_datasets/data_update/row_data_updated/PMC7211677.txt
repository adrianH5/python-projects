In the late winter of 2019, emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to the COVID-19 pandemic, manifesting in a serious illness affecting over a million people around the world, including the United States, during the spring of 2020 [1].
Not only is there the likelihood of increased morbidity and mortality if these individuals become infected with the virus, but the social and economic consequences of COVID-19 may significantly impact their access to critical healthcare resources.
Each has specific considerations that may be impacted by aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Older adults and people of all ages who have serious underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 [19].
Inflammation in COVID-19 infection results in a decrease of helper, suppressor and regulatory T cells and of gamma interferon.
The variability in effects of COVID-19 infection rates coupled with the variability in baseline GD disease burden will likely complicate addressing the extent of the vulnerability to infection in this population.
Initial symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, malaise, cough, impairment of sense of smell and/or taste and gastrointestinal disturbance.
The pulmonary involvement prevalent in this group may worsen with COVID-19 disease.
This “inflammatory storm”, observed in very ill patients with COVID-19, results from excessive and prolonged activation of proinflammatory stimuli. [23,59]
This inflammatory syndrome may occur days to weeks after acute COVID-19 illness, with some patients developing cardiogenic or vasogenic shock requiring intensive care for multiple organ dysfunction.
The response of patients with Gaucher disease to COVID-19 and/or its pharmacological interventions:
