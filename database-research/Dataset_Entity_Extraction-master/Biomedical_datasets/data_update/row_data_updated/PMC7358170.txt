On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has officially declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic.
Estimates of LOD based on CPE observation on VERO cells were found to be in the range of 1 × 101–1 × 10−2 TCID50 for a wide group of viral families (Gombold et al., 2014).
A dataset of 3.995 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences was retrieved from GISAID database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017).
The multi-genome alignment including our genome, GISAID genomes and reference genome was obtained using the Purple pipeline (Gona et al., 2020), (available at https://skynet.unimi.it/index.php/tools/purple-tool/).
Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3
) revealed that the sequenced strain is closely related to a SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated on March, 3rd, 2020 in Milan (GISAID code EPI_ISL_413489).
