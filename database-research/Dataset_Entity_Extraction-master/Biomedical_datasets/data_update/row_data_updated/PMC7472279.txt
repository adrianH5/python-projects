Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) represent a significant challenge to global health.
The frequency of EID outbreaks has dramatically increased over the last decades.
Most EIDs have a zoonotic origin; more than 70% of them are caused by pathogens originating from wildlife [1].
The ongoing outbreak with the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is a perfect illustration of the potential impact and the global consequences resulting from a single cross-species transmission from an animal virus.
It is thus important to be prepared for new EID outbreaks.
The current COVID-19 outbreak with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the seventh coronavirus (CoV) identified in humans since the 1960s [6,7].
Here we conducted a pilot study on the presence of CoVs in bats in Guinea, West Africa, a country with a high likelihood for EID outbreaks and where humans are frequently directly or indirectly exposed to bats (A.K. Keita, personal observation).
The new sequences were deposited in the GenBank under accession numbers MT586773-MT586805.
The new sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MT586830-MT586867.
Zoonoses can constitute a threat for public health that can have a global importance, as seen with the current COVID-19 pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2).
