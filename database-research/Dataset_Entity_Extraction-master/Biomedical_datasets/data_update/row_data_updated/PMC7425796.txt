However, some recent coronavirus infections have resulted in serious morbidity and mortality, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2–4], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5, 6], and SARS-CoV-2, which are responsible for the current worldwide pandemic, COVID-19.
In Abelin et al. [34], we demonstrated that improved HLA-II binding prediction led to improved immunogenicity prediction by validating this approach on a data set of immune responses to a diverse collection of pathogens and allergens [35, 36].
Here, we specifically validated the binding predictors utilizing Coronaviridae family peptides that had been assayed for T cell reactivity or MHC binding from the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) database [34].
The ViPR database integrates viral pathogen data from internally curated data, researcher submissions, and data from various external sources.
Experimentally determined epitopes for the Coronaviridae family for human hosts were retrieved from the ViPR database (https://www.viprbrc.org/; accessed March 5, 2020) [39].
To build a validation dataset, both positives and negatives for T cell assays and MHC binding assays were obtained.
Peptide-HLA-I allele pairs in the ViPR validation dataset were scored using our HLA-I binding predictor, a neural network trained on mono-allelic MS data [33].
Similarly, peptide-HLA-II allele pairs in the ViPR validation dataset were scored using our HLA-II binding predictor, a recently published convolutional neural network-based model also trained on mono-allelic MS data [34].
In vitro MHC binding assays, which represent the vast majority of the ViPR dataset, do not require endogenous processing and presentation for a positive binding result.
The GenBank reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 (accession: NC_045512.2, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512) was used for this study.
In addition, due to its high expression level in recently published proteomic datasets [40–42], ORF9b, as annotated by UniProt (P0DTD2, https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000464024), was also used for epitope predictions.
When comparing our 20 SARS-CoV-2-predicted epitopes with the ViPR dataset, 8 epitopes were previously assayed and confirmed as HLA-A02:01 binders.
SARS-CoV-2 proteomic datasets were downloaded from the PRIDE repository (Bojkova et al. [40]: PXD017710, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017710; Bezstarosti et al. [41]: PXD018760, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018760; Davidson et al. [42]: PXD018241, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018241).
For the dataset from Bojkova et al. [40] which employed isobaric mass tags, TMT11 was added as a fixed modification to peptide N-termini and lysines, and 13C6-15N2-TMT11-lysine and 13C6-15N4-arginine were added as variable modifications.
All datasets were searched against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (UniProtKB, 28 April 2020, 14 entries) concatenated to databases containing either the Homo sapiens proteome ([40], UCSC Genome Browser hg19 annotation, 63,691 entries) or the Chlorocebus sabaeus proteome ([41, 42] UniProtKB, 9229 entries).
Spectral counts were normalized to the length of each protein, and the maximum value within each dataset was set to 100%.
To that end, we used the ViPR database [39], which lists the results of T cell immunogenicity and MHC-peptide binding assays for both HLA-I and HLA-II alleles for viral pathogen epitopes.
We used all assays of Coronaviridae family viruses with human hosts from ViPR as our validation dataset.
For HLA-I, within the validation dataset, there were a total of 4445 unique peptide-HLA allele pairs that were assayed for MHC binding, using variations of (1) cellular MHC or purified MHC, (2) a direct or competitive assay, and (3) measurement by fluorescence or radioactivity.
We then applied our HLA-I binding predictor to the peptide-MHC allele pairs in the validation dataset and compared the computed HLA-I percent ranks of these pairs with the reported MHC binding assay results (Additional file 8: Table S8).
In total, there were 4445 peptide-HLA-I allele pairs in the ViPR dataset we obtained (see the “Methods” section).
There were 259 unique peptide-MHC allele pairs assayed by MHC binding assays in the ViPR validation dataset for HLA-II.
This comparison could not be performed with the “Negative” pairs as an independent group since there was only one negative result in the validation dataset for HLA-II.
Similar to the HLA-I T cell assays, there were too few recorded HLA-II T cell assays in our validation dataset to determine percent rank differences between peptide-HLA II allele pairs testing positive and negative.
We first performed the analysis for HLA-I peptide binding and computed the likelihood of each peptide of lengths 8–12 amino acids from the 13 SARS-CoV-2 ORFs to bind to any HLA-I allele in our database.
To test the validity of the SARS-CoV-2-predicted peptide-HLA pairs, we looked for peptide sequences in the Coronaviridae portion of the ViPR database which exactly matched SARS-CoV-2 peptide sequences (Fig. 2d).
A total of 374 HLA-I peptide-MHC allele pairs from SARS-CoV-2 had both a percent rank lower than 1% by our predictor and were found in the HLA-I MHC binding validation dataset.
As a comparison, we also tested for overlap between epitopes predicted to have low likelihood of MHC binding (percent rank 50% or higher) and the validation dataset.
Despite the significantly smaller number of peptide-MHC allele pairs that were tested for T cell reactivity in the validation dataset, 10 assayed pairs were also highly predicted by our HLA-I binding predictor.
No low-scoring pairs (percent rank of 50% or above) were reported in the validation dataset.
In order to determine the relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we analyzed three publicly available proteomic datasets that acquired unbiased LC-MS/MS on tryptic digestions of SARS-CoV-2-infected host cells [40–42].
Specifically, it confirmed that the N protein is the most abundant viral protein across all three datasets following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5).
This finding is corroborated by reports of N-derived peptides being detected in gargle solution samples from COVID-19 patients [57].
Our database of supported HLA-I and HLA-II alleles provides us with the ability to not only identify many peptide-MHC allele pairs, but to generate a narrow list of peptides with many potential HLA pairings that could be presented by the entire US, European, and Asian-Pacific Islander populations.
T cell responses to a small set of epitopes from the S protein in COVID-19 patient or healthy donor PBMCs.
T cell responses in COVID-19 patients from healthy donor samples collected before or during the pandemic.
Their data also show that 10 additional peptides sporadically induce responses in 2–3 individuals from either the healthy donor or the COVID-19 patient cohorts (total of 31 individuals).
While focusing on a small set of two COVID-19 patients and one healthy donor, Chour et al. [61] demonstrate that five HLA-A02:01-restricted epitopes from the S protein elicited a CD8+
The differences in training data lead to algorithms that prioritize substantially different epitope sets, even for well-studied alleles.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel vaccine targets for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
We first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database.
From our SARS-CoV-2-predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 374 pairs identically matched what was previously reported in the ViPR database, originating from other coronaviruses with identical sequences.
