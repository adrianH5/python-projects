The X‐ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the Structural Biology Center 19‐ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.
The data set was processed and scaled with the HKL3000 suite.
The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under accession code 6VWW and 6W01 for Nsp15/apo and Nsp15/cit, respectively.
