The entire world is facing a devastating crisis in the growing pandemic associated with the coronavirus disease—COVID-19—and Italy is paying dearly for this pandemic both in terms of public health and economics.
Since Feb 21, 2020, when the first Italian COVID-19 patient was confirmed, the National Healthcare Service, based on the Beveridge model offering universal and equal health care to all citizens, has faced increasing pressure, with 110,574 total cases of COVID-19 and 13,155 deaths as of April 1, 2020 [1].
Herein, we report changes regarding the execution of the germline BRCA (gBRCA) testing, during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, in a referral center for the gBRCA testing [2–5].
With the implementation of the behavioural restrictions by the Italian Government (March 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial reduction in gBRCA testing (about 60%) compared to the first 2 months of the current year was registered, but the requests have not been reset.
Even in the presence of a serious ongoing emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that cancer patients must continue to take advantage of gBRCA testing to target therapy.
The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia.
