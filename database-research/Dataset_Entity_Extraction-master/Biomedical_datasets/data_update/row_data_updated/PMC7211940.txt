Biochemists, microbiologists, and ecologists with general molecular training may have the technical skills to run COVID-19 assays, but they don’t have the appropriate certifications.
Even so, the urgency of the pandemic has spurred some states to relax legal restrictions on who can perform COVID-19 testing.
On March 12, for example, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order suspending certification and licensure requirements for any researcher with relevant skills who meets CLIA requirements to run the COVID-19 test; such a person may now temporarily run the assays under the supervision of a medical laboratory scientist in a CLIA-certified lab (4).
On March 19, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards issued a proclamation to temporarily suspend some certification and licensure requirements for running COVID-19 assays.
Now, laboratory personnel “who demonstrate molecular biology polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experience” can legally run COVID-19 tests if they are supervised by a licensed physician or PhD with related lab experience, according to the proclamation (5).
Hence, an ecologist trained in PCR might now be a candidate to run COVID-19 assays, if properly supervised, says Vincent Culotta, executive director of the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners in New Orleans.
The several medical laboratory scientists already working there will oversee at least 15 Berkeley postdoctoral molecular biologist volunteers, who will run the COVID-19 assays.
Some testing centers made their own COVID-19 assays, choosing their preferred brand of RNA extraction kits, primers, PCR machines, and swabs, Schaletzky explains.
After the FDA granted emergency-use authorization for the test in late March, Abbott estimated that it could deliver 50,000 COVID-19 tests per day (10).
