Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread globally and cause massive societal disruption and death.
As of August 3, 2020, COVID-19 has been responsible for >18 million cases and approximately 690,000 deaths worldwide (Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, , last accessed August 3, 2020).
The United States is in the midst of a substantial surge of new cases, and despite months of effort, few treatment options with proven efficacy for COVID-19 are available.
Currently, hundreds of registered clinical trials are underway, most of which are assessing antiretroviral agents, anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant therapies, and passive antibody treatments.1, 2, 3 The antiretroviral remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor with activity against SARS-associated coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has shown promise in a recent randomized controlled trial, reducing recovery time in certain COVID-19 patients.
Many vaccines are in various stages of development, and one is being studied in a phase 3 trial, but it will be at least many months before an efficacious vaccine is available.

 Thus, although many prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are under investigation, the primary management of COVID-19 remains supportive care.
The Food and Drug Administration rapidly made pathways available for the administration or study of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, and convalescent plasma remains the only widely available passive antibody therapy.
Similar safety findings have been shown in other studies.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23
We recently published our early experience with convalescent plasma treatment in 25 patients with severe COVID-19.
COVID-19 patients admitted to any of the eight Houston Methodist hospitals were considered for enrollment in this trial.

 Patients were eligible for this study if they had severe and/or life-threatening COVID-19 (US Food and Drug Administration, , last accessed July 11, 2020).
US Food and Drug Administration recommendations for COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor collection were followed (, last accessed July 11, 2020).
All plasma was donated by recovered and healthy COVID-19 patients who had been asymptomatic for >14 days.
Convalescent plasma titer assessment was performed as recently described.
,
 Briefly, purified recombinant ectodomain, composed of amino acid residues 1 to 1208, and/or RBD, composed of amino acids 319 to 591, of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (; GenBank accession number MN908947) were coated onto microtiter plates.
Baseline patient characteristics for all COVID-19 patients and for patients who met a 28-day outcome are shown in Supplemental Table S1.
A titer of ≥1:1350 was chosen on the basis of previous work that demonstrated that an anti-RBD IgG 1:1350 indicated an 80% probability of viral neutralization titer ≥1:160, the recommended viral neutralization cutoff for COVID-19 convalescent plasma for therapeutic purposes.
In this study, data from 2724 admitted COVID-19 patients were available for analysis, 316 of whom were transfused with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (Figure 1
).
Baseline characteristics of all admitted COVID-19 patients are shown (Supplemental Table S1).
Most transfused patients (242/316; 76%) received only one unit of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.
In a smaller study by Hegerova et al, 20 COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma had improved laboratory and respiratory parameters compared with matched controls, and in both matched control studies, nonintubated patients benefited more from transfusion than intubated patients.
Data from 20,000 transfused COVID-19 patients support the notion that transfusion earlier in the clinical course is more beneficial.
A recent study from the Netherlands showed that at the time of transfusion (median, 10 days post-symptom onset), many (80%) of the COVID-19 patients already had detectable neutralizing antibody titers, although the titer of transfused plasma units was higher than that found in recipients; the study was discontinued as a result of this finding.
This analysis has implications for collection, use, and study of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.
Substantial efforts are underway in the United States to collect COVID-19 convalescent plasma.
Clinical trials are ongoing in many centers, and the data presented herein may inform the assessment of equipoise in their design and conduct.39, 40, 41, 42
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has spread globally, and proven treatments are limited.
Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 is among many approaches being studied as potentially efficacious therapy.
We are conducting a prospective, propensity score–matched study assessing the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion versus standard of care as treatment for severe and/or critical COVID-19.
Of the 316 transfused patients, 136 met a 28-day outcome and were matched to 251 non-transfused control COVID-19 patients.
These data suggest that treatment of COVID-19 with high anti–receptor binding domain IgG titer convalescent plasma is efficacious in early-disease patients.
