When the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged at the end of 2019, there were many speculations about the potential impact and course of progression, but none would have imagined the speed and the scale of its spread and devastation to people's lives and livelihood across the global [1,2].
Despite the unprecedented efforts and rapid scientific progress in the discovery of the cellular and molecular details for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as a result of SARS-COV2 infection, there are still no specific new therapies that have been approved to either prevent or treat COVID19 in clinics [1,2].
However, new insights towards the pathogenesis of COVID19 have led to many efforts to repurpose existing drugs for the disease.
While many of these repurposing attempts are aimed to interrupt the life-cycle of the SARS-COV2 virus infection or the ensuing systemic inflammatory injury, it is now clear that the adverse outcome of COVID19 can be strongly contributed by a number of pre-existing conditions, in particular hypertension and metabolic disorders.
In recent retrospective studies led by a consortium of investigators based on a large clinical cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China, one class of medicine originally used for blood pressure management (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blockers) [7], and another class of medication originally prescribed for hyperlipidemia (statins) [8], were analyzed for their association with COVID-19 related death and other secondary outcome.
After extensive adjustment and matching for major clinical risk profiles, statistical analyses showed both ACEi/ARB and statins were found to be associated with a significant reduction in death and adverse outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Nevertheless, it is emerging that several therapies originally approved to treat pre-existing conditions may bring clinical benefits to reduce death and severe complications in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1
