Hence, while we await for the results of the efficacy of camostat in a very recently initiated human clinical trial with COVID19 patients (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04321096), this report wishes to incentivize once again private and public efforts to consider developing new pan-serine protease inhibitors, perhaps taking advantage of several agents already being reported in pre-clinical studies [36,37,38,39,40], into emergency therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 and to ward off future similar pandemics that are likely to occur when pathogens acquire the further optimized furin cleavage sites within their priming entry mechanisms.
