Frail patients, such as elderly people or those with underlying conditions, are at higher risk of complications related to COVID-19.1
Preliminary data suggest an increased risk of developing infection-related severe events (ie, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation or death) in the case of antitumour treatment administration within two weeks before COVID-19 diagnosis.
The Italian directives for the management of onco-haematological patients on therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic recommend considering treatment delays on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the characteristics of the patient and the disease.
Among these patients, 16 (94%) had symptoms related to COVID-19; eight had severe respiratory symptoms, and 13 (76%) were admitted to hospital (table 1).
At a median follow-up of 15 days since the confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the case fatality rate was 24%: four patients out of 17 died due to severe COVID-19, two of whom were on oncological follow-up (ie, off therapy).
Similarly, other patients currently in hospital with mild COVID-19 syndrome might need to resume their therapeutic plan after complete resolution of their symptoms despite SARS-CoV-2 still being detectable potentially for weeks.
Based on our preliminary experience, we are opening a new unit that will work as a regional cancer hub for the care of patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 within a multidisciplinary team.
