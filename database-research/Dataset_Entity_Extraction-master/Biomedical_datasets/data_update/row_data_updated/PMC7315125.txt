Examination of a publicly available gene expression data set (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession number GSE147507) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of A549 human lung cells also showed a significant upregulation of CD47 compared to mock-infected controls (Fig. 1D).
To examine CD47 expression in human viral infection, we first compared transcriptional levels of CD47 from publicly available microarray data (GEO accession number GSE38597) from healthy and hepatitis C virus (HCV) patient liver biopsy specimens.
La Crosse virus (LACV) infections were performed with a 1978 human isolate provided as a gift from Stephen Whitehead (NIAID, NIH).
All antibodies were from BD Biosciences, BioLegend, or eBioscience/Thermo Fisher Scientific, including Brilliant Violet 605-anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), phycoerythrin (PE)-CF594-anti-CD19 (clone ID3), PE-Cy7-anti-CD11c (clone HL3), PE-Cy7-anti-Ter119 (clone TER-119), Alexa Fluor 647-anti-CD47 (clone MIAP301), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-anti-major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) (I-A/I-E) (catalog number FAB6118F); lymphocyte populations were initially gated on single live cells on the basis of forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC).
A publicly available gene expression data set from SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549 cells (accession number GSE147507) (n = 10) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
