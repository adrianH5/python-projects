A
recent study indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was 96% identical to a bat coronavirus RaTG13
(accession: MN996532) at the genomic level, suggesting that bat might be a natural host of
SARS-CoV-2 [7].
GISAID is a platform for sharing
genetic data of influenza.
Currently, a rapidly increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
sequences are being deposited into this database from laboratories around the world [8].
A total of 343 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in the GISAID platform (https://platform.gisaid.org/) as of 10 March 2020 with 5 March 2020 as
cut-off date were downloaded [8].
A total of
247 sequences with high sequence quality as noted in the GISAID database were included for
further analysis after removing sequences containing little temporal signal and thus are
not unsuitable for inference using phylogenetic molecular clock models.
Information
regarding the date and country of isolation were also retrieved from the GISAID platform.
The annotated reference genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession:
NC_045512.2) was downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database.
A total of 22 such genome
sequences were reported so far, accounting for 9% of the 247 SARS-CoV-2 sequences
documented in the GISAID database as of 5 March 2020.
Viruses in SS4 were
responsible for the explosive increase in incidence of COVID-19 in Europe in March (Table 4).
Upon completion of analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in the GISAID database as
of 5 March 2020 and identification of the four “super-spreader” type strains, we
investigated if viral strains of the four super-spreaders were responsible for the vast
majority of subsequent infections.
We conducted detailed and comprehensive analyses of 247 high quality SARS-CoV-2 sequences
deposited in the GISAID database during the period December 2019 to 5 March 2020 to provide
insight into the evolution and transmission of this novel virus (Figure 3).
This second dataset
showed that viruses of SS4 have since been transmitted to other parts of world including
Africa, Asia, North America and Oceania.
To trace the evolution route and probe the transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform as of 5 March 2020.
