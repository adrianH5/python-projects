COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world; approximately all developed and developing countries and nations (Amirhossein Takian and Kazempour-Ardebili, 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020a).
In Iran, the first official announcement of death due to COVID-19 was reported by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education on February 19, 2020 (Amirhossein Takian and Kazempour-Ardebili, 2020).
On March 31, 2020, Iran with 44,605 COVID-19 cases and 2898 its deaths was the 7th and 6th highest ranking, among 203 countries and territories throughout the world which have experienced COVID-19 outbreak (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries).
Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally, investigations are under way to better understand the potential of airborne transmission mode of the virus as well as the clinical characteristics and severity of the disease (Ghinai et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020a).
To better manage the risks of COVID-19, particularly for health-care workers (Cheung et al., 2020), it is extremely crucial to address the importance of airborne transmission as one of the most important challenge/question of international COVID-19 outbreak.
We conducted the present study on March 17, 2020 in hospital wards with confirmed COVID-19 at Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex in Tehran, Iran.
On March 31, 2020, Tehran province with the highest confirmed COVID-19 cases ranked the first place among all provinces in Iran.
As a highly efficient approach to sample the airborne viruses, the impinger technique was used in order to collect the air sample of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 (Dart and Thornburg, 2008; Verreault et al., 2008).
Table 1
reveals the specifications of all collected samples of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of hospital wards, and Table 2
provides additional information on environmental status of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19.
As shown in Table 1, there were forty-four patients confirmed with COVID-19 that were receiving oxygen mask (n = 22) and intubation (n = 22) treatments.
It was reported that COVID-19 patients are afflicted with the dry and short cough (Ghinai et al., 2020).
As we had limited access to the wards, the number of collected samples might not be generalized to the all wards of hospital with confirmed COVID-19 patients.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, in late 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world.
Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19.
We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020.
Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients' beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative.
