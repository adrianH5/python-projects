ARBs block the effects of excessive activation of Angiotensin II AT1 receptors (AT1R), a major injury factor participating in the development of disorders of the brain, the cardiovascular system, the kidney, lipid and glucose metabolism and the immune system, enhancing inflammation and viral injury in the lung and linearly associated with viral load and lung injury in COVID-19 patients [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]].
These compounds are well-tolerated in the elderly and successfully used not only as first-line antihypertensives but also in the treatment of diabetes, kidney disease, congestive heart failure and cerebrovascular disorders, which are frequent COVID-19 comorbidities [8].
These findings are of interest because cerebrovascular complications are frequent in patients affected by COVID-19 and their prevalence increases in severe cases and in the elderly [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]].
For these reasons it was reasonable to suggest that ARBs could be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, by ameliorating inflammation, hypertension and other comorbidities and directly protecting the lung and other organs from the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Multiple clinical studies are in progress to determine the effect of ARB therapy in COVID-19 patients https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&term=angiotensin+receptor+blockers&cntry=&state=&city=&dist= and preliminary evidence indicates a reduction of critical prognosis and a lower death rate in ARB-treated COVID-19 patients [24].
Recent transcriptomic analysis of samples from COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human alveolar cells revealed unique inflammatory profiles with excessive inflammatory cytokine release, alterations in interferon responses, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, increased apoptosis and p53 signaling associated with lymphopenia [25,26].
We had previously reported that these changes in cultured neurons were strikingly correlated with those observed in aging, one of the most important risk factors for COVID-19, not only in the brain but also in peripheral tissues [16,17].
The recent transcriptome analyses of samples from COVID-19 patients [25,26] provided an opportunity to correlate their findings with those obtained earlier reporting ARBs anti-inflammatory and anti-aging protective effects [16,17].
We analyzed our own raw data from a previous experiment (Elkahloun et al., 2016) submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE67036.
The raw data was submitted to GEO under accession GSE67036.
We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [27] (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/) to compare our data to published datasets [26] (GSE147507) downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GEO database, and [25], CRA002390 downloaded from their supplemental data and the Genome Sequence Archive in BIG (Beijing Institute of Genomics) Data Center (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/
), Chinese Academy of Sciences [28].
A complete description of these data sets is summarized in Table 1
.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (http://www.ingenuity.com) [33], Gene Ontology (http://geneontology.org/) [34], Metascape (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1) [35] and Jensen Compartments database (https://compartments.jensenlab.org/) [36] were used to identify gene expression profiles and canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes.
Using GSEA, we now asked the question whether this comparison would reveal normalization by Candesartan of gene signatures characteristic of COVID-19.
We found a highly statistical positive correlation between the expression of a large number of genes upregulated by glutamate and those genes upregulated in four different SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 human transcriptomes: a normal primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell culture infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1, Fig. 1
A), lung tissue post mortem samples from 2 COVID-19 patients and 2 lung biopsies from healthy controls (Table 1, Fig. 1B), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 3 COVID-19 patients and 3 healthy controls (Table 1, Fig. 1C) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 2 COVID-19 patients and 3 healthy controls (Table 1, Fig. 1D).

The figure represents gene set enrichment analysis plots showing the positive correlations of genes upregulated by glutamate (in red) and normalized by Candesartan (in blue) in our neuronal cell culture with genes upregulated in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 (A), lung tissue post mortem samples from COVID-19 patients (B), peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients (C) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients (D) (see Supplemental Table 1 for complete GSEA output).
Conversely, we found a striking negative correlation between expression of these genes after Candesartan treatment and those genes upregulated in the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 human transcriptomes.
The top 20 genes with the highest rank metric scores in each enrichment dataset are listed in Table 2
, that includes many genes related to cytokine and chemokine activity, chemokine receptor binding, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, NF-κB complex, cellular response to type I interferon, type I interferon signaling pathway, response to interferon γ and response to virus, such as CXCL1, CXCL6, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL16, CCL4, IL1RN, IFITM1, RSAD2, PTGS2, BIRC3, AIF1 and ASS1.
When the top 20 genes with the highest rank metric scores in each enrichment dataset were compared, each dataset revealed an apparent unique transcriptome signature, the result of different types of cells included in each transcriptome.
To reveal the genes most commonly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we generated a list of 210 genes consistently upregulated and GSEA enriched in at least 2 out of the 4 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 human transcriptomes, that were also upregulated by glutamate and normalized by Candesartan in our neuronal culture.
In addition, Supplemental Table 2 lists the individual gene associations with their dataset origin, the genes commonly upregulated in NHBE cells and PBMC, BALF and PBMC, and lung autopsies and PBMC databases.
From the Jensen Compartments database, we identified 50 highly significant gene expression profiles, and some of the most significant with highest numbers of genes were the NF-kappa B complex, interferon regulatory factor 7, interferon regulatory factor complex, interleukin-12 complex, interleukin-23 complex, S100A9 complex, extracellular space and Bcl-2 family protein complex (Table 3, Supplemental Table 3).
Individual analysis of the list of 210 genes upregulated in at least 2 out of 4 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 human transcriptomes, that were also upregulated by glutamate and normalized by Candesartan in our neuronal culture (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) revealed some genes encoding for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for viral entry or regulating their function (RIG-1 (DDX58), TLR4, MYD88, HERC6).
Excessive inflammation with a cytokine storm and innate and adaptive immune alterations are hallmarks of COVID-19 [25,26], a disorder more severely affecting the elderly and involving not only the lung but many other organs, including the brain [37].
Because of the above, we asked the question whether the strong anti-inflammatory effects and normalization of the immune response by Candesartan could be in any way related to a relief of the cytokine storm and immune alterations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we compared, using GSEA, our results with the recently reported gene signature samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells and COVID-19 patients [25,26].
As expected, because of the different source of the materials examined, each of the datasets studied revealed unique transcriptome signatures when only the top 20 genes with highest rank metric scores in each enrichment dataset were reported (Table 2).
The NHBE transcriptome included ICAM1, important for recruitment of inflammatory immune cells and participating in the COVID-19 response [38], and IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated to poor COVID-19 response [39,40].
The transcriptome from COVID-19 post mortem samples contained CYBB (NOX2) [41] a super-oxide generating enzyme forming excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection [42] and TLR7, a Toll-like receptor essential for antiviral immunity, including the response to SARS-CoV-2 [[43], [44], [45]].
The PBMC transcriptome revealed HMOX1, with anti-inflammatory properties [46,47], and IL18, a proinflammatory cytokine reported to play an important role in COVID-19 [[48], [49], [50]].
However, when the entire lists of enriched genes were compared (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2) we found hundreds of enriched genes in each of the datasets studied.
Individual analysis of the 210-gene list revealed many genes playing major roles in COVID-19 pathology.
MyD88 plays an important role in IL-6 induction during COVID-19 [57].
RIG‐I is a PRR sensing RNA virus, upregulated by viral infection [58] and has been implicated in the induction of early antiviral immune responses in COVID-19 [59].
Many genes are associated to the COVID-19 cytokine storm.
CXCL10 is a chemokine attracting macrophages and promoting T cell adhesion in response to interferon [69] and is part of the COVID-19 cytokine storm [70].
STAT1 is activated by interferon and IL-6, polarizing the immune response specifically in macrophages, resulting in a worsened COVID-19 outcome [[75], [76], [77], [78]].
Increased TNFα production and release, associated with IL-1α and IL-β and inversely correlated with lymphopenia and decreased IFN-γ expression, is characteristic of severe COVID-19 [[79], [80], [81], [82]].
Their upregulation may play a role in the high risk of thrombosis of COVID-19 patients [103,104].
The beneficial effect of ARB treatment may not be limited to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity but may extend to ameliorate long-term consequences of the disease.
Pulmonary fibrosis leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension and irreversible respiratory failure is likely to occur in patients recovered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with critically severe COVID-19 [57,129,130].
Old age is a major risk factor for COVID-19 progression and death [5,18,138].
It has been recently shown that one Alzheimer’s risk gene correlates with risk for severe COVID-19 [141].
Within our 210-gene list, a genetic variant of IFITM3 has been recently associated with age-dependent COVID-19 severity [142], and ADAP2 has been proposed to participate in Alzheimer’s disease progression [143].
SARS-CoV-2 infection not only affects the lung but extends to many other organs, including the brain, and age-related cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral hemorrhage and stroke are not only frequent comorbidities but also novel and critical events in the presentation, progress and prognosis of COVID-19 [18,19,[21], [22], [23],146,147].
Our IPA upstream regulator analysis identified many factors that may downregulate COVID-19 upregulated genes in our study, including dexamethasone, immunoglobulin, beta-estradiol, and simvastatin.
Dexamethasone has been proposed for acutely ill COVID-19 patients, but its use carries severe risks and needs to be carefully evaluated [152].
Immunoglobulin was reported to be effective in severely ill COVID-19 patients [153].
Not surprisingly, many proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL1B, IL6, IL13), PRRs such as TLR4 and TLR7, and inflammation-inducing drugs such as lipopolysaccharide were found to positively correlate with COVID-19 upregulated genes.
It has also been reported that ARBs ameliorate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients [[176], [177], [178], [179]], after viral infections [6,[180], [181], [182], [183], [184], [185], [186]], in diabetic patients [187] and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [[188], [189], [190]].
Improved clinical outcome after ARB treatment of COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced IL-6 in peripheral blood, increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts and reduced peak viral load [178] and lower concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) [24].
These findings support the present correlation of our neuronal transcriptome with that of PBMC in COVID-19 patients.
However, the role of AT2 receptor activation in COVID-19 patients has not been studied.
•  Glutamate upregulated genes in neurons positively correlate with COVID-19 upregulated genes.
•  Candesartan gene downregulation negatively correlates with COVID-19 upregulated genes.
•  Candesartan downregulates genes involved in the COVID-19 cytokine storm.
Background  Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reducing inflammation and protecting lung and brain function, could be of therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 patients.
Methods  Using GSEA, we compared our previous transcriptome analysis of neurons injured by glutamate and treated with the ARB Candesartan (GSE67036) with transcriptional signatures from SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and lung postmortem (GSE147507), PBMC and BALF samples (CRA002390) from COVID-19 patients.
Results  Hundreds of genes upregulated in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 transcriptomes were similarly upregulated by glutamate and normalized by Candesartan.
Gene Ontology analysis revealed expression profiles with greatest significance and enrichment, including proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine activity, the NF-kappa B complex, alterations in innate and adaptive immunity, with many genes participating in the COVID-19 cytokine storm.
This supports the hypothesis of a therapeutic role for ARBs, ameliorating the COVID-19 cytokine storm.
