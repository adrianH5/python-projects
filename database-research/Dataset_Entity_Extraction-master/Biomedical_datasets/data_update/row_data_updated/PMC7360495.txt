Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a life-threatening disorder, although the rate of AKI in COVID-19 is relatively rare.
According to reports from Wuhan, China, among 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, only 5 (3.6%) patients developed AKI and 2 (1.5%) patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) [1].
There are no data about managing CRRT, including prevention of secondary infection and control (IPC) in COVID-19 patients.
Here, we report a case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who required CRRT.
A septuagenarian male suffering from COVID-19 was referred to our hospital.
According to a recent report from Wuhan, China, among 52 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to the ICU, 12 (23%) patients developed AKI and 9 (17%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT) [6].
With the increasing number of COVID-19 patients, the need for RRT is likely to increase.
Although the recommendation by the WHO for the use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 did not include CRRT [8], we considered the risk of aerosol generation during CRRT.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the management of CRRT including IPC among COVID-19 patients.
From our experience, we suggest clinical practice and IPC for delivering RRT in the acute phase in COVID-19 patients who develop AKI (Table 2).
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health threat.
Recently, we had a critically ill COVID-19 patient who developed severe AKI and needed continuous RRT (CRRT).
Due to unstable hemodynamic status in critically ill patients, CRRT should be the first choice for severe AKI in COVID-19 patients.
We suggest prevention of clinical infection and control during administration of RRT in the acute phase of COVID-19 patients with AKI or multiple organ failure.
