In December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was described in Wuhan, China (Guan et al., 2020).
Furthermore, particulate matter 2.5 μm or less in diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter 10 μm or less in diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) or ozone (O3) have been also associated with COVID-19 incidence (Bashir et al., 2020b; Fronza et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Ogen, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), but it remains unclear if these correlations are actually related to causation (Riccò et al., 2020).
Regarding weather conditions, there are several studies that have been published during recent months reporting negative correlation between temperature and COVID-19 cases (see for example Luo et al., 2020; Pequeno et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), humidity and death counts (Ma et al., 2020) or rainfall and new daily cases (Menebo, 2020).
More data is needed to derive more conclusive results and to elucidate the actual impact of ambient factors on COVID-19 pandemic.
Daily COVID-19 total cases and cases diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the autonomous communities and provinces have been obtained from the Ministry of Health of Spain (MISAN, 2020).
However, this approach has been criticized due to the possible bias produced by the rapid expansion of the number of infected by COVID-19 (Baud et al., 2020; Spychalski et al., 2020).
In order to take into account the lockdown effect on the COVID-19 incidence, partial correlation was applied (Ahmadi et al., 2020) correcting by the number of lockdown days.
Taking the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain (see Introduction section) into account, we analyzed the pollutants levels in 3 periods: prior to lockdown (January 23rd to March 13th, 50 days), strict lockdown (March 14th to May 3rd, 50 days) and relaxed lockdown (May 4th to June 20th, 47 days).
There are previous studies that associate temperature, solar radiation, wind speed or rainfall with COVID-19 cases or deaths in different regions (Bashir et al., 2020a; Guasp et al., 2020; Kifer et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Pequeno et al., 2020; Rosario et al., 2020; Tosepu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
As can be observed, correlations among wind speed and rainfall with cases are very heterogeneous and non-significant for most of the Spanish communities, indicating that these variables were not correlated with the COVID-19 incidence in Spain.
Therefore, when we calculated partial correlations between temperature, solar radiation and daily detected COVID-19 cases controlling the influence of the lockdown (Table 3
), correlation coefficients were low and non-significant for most of the communities.
These results indicate that although temperature and solar radiation may have a role in COVID-19 incidence, they are not the main factors and long-term data is required in order to have conclusive results.
In this context, large efforts have been made to develop software tools to collect COVID-19 global pandemic data, like the dashboard developed by the John Hopkins University (Dong et al., 2020) or HealthMap (Xu et al., 2020).
We also used DatAC to explore the relationship between meteorological variables and the amount of daily COVID-19 cases, finding heterogeneous and non-significant correlation for wind speed and rainfall, but large and significant negative correlation for temperature and solar radiation in almost all Spanish communities.
These results indicate that lockdown, and not temperature nor solar radiation, was the driving factor of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution in Spain.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented global health crisis, with several countries imposing lockdowns to control the coronavirus spread.
Data with spatial and temporal information is a key factor to get reliable results and, although there are some data repositories for monitoring the disease both globally and locally, an application that integrates and aggregates data from meteorological and air quality variables with COVID-19 information has not been described so far to the best of our knowledge.
Here, we present DatAC (Data Against COVID-19), a data fusion project with an interactive web frontend that integrates COVID-19 and environmental data in Spain.
Moreover, the application allowed us to analyze correlations among climate factors, such as ambient temperature, and the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain.
