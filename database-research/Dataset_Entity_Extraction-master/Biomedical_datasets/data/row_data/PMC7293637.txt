Forster et al. (1) use a median-joining (MJ) network (MJN) and its Steinerization process to investigate the evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within humans.
Because their work may have profound implications for understanding and managing the COVID-19 global pandemic, scrutiny is necessary.
In fact, the implication that MJNs reflect phylogenetic signal in the traditional sense has previously been challenged by Kong (3), who compared inference based on MJNs with Bayesian model-based phylogenetic inference for 85 published datasets and found substantial disagreement between inferred MJNs and posterior distributions on phylogenies, indicating that the two methods provide different measures of relatedness in a phylogenetic sense.
