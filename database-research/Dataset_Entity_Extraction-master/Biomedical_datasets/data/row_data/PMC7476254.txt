With the raging COVID-19 pandemic ongoing, the interaction between aging and immune response to the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 has attracted great attention.
It has been widely reported that elderly people are more susceptible to COVID-19 and, once infected, the consequence is much more severe.
The deaths associated with COVID-19 have been largely attributed to respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac failure, kidney injury, or coagulopathy.
Having quantified the changes in PBMC due to aging, the authors went on to analyze the interaction between aging and COVID-19.
Through a four-way comparison of young and old subjects with and without COVID-19, the authors found that COVID-19 infections lead to a depletion of TC and an increase of MC population, and in particular a depletion of CD4+ naive TC and increase of CD16+
MC, and that aged subjects with COVID-19 further exacerbated these trends.
Since CD16+ MC has highly pro-inflammatory properties (e.g., high expression of proinflammatory cytokines) compared with the non-CD16 expressing classic monocytes and are expanded in various inflammatory diseases (Ziegler-Heitbrock, 2007), the observation of Zheng et al., suggests that aging and COVID-19 act synergistically to drain the adaptive immune system and to exacerbate the overly inflammatory response that may be partially responsible for the severity of the infection in aged patients.
Future studies should examine the interactions between aging and other viral infections using a similar approach, to see whether the observed effect is general or specific to COVID-19.
