A major reason for the failure to know when or where the virus first appeared seems to have been the widespread occurrence of asymptomatic cases of COVID‐19.
Importantly, there appear to be observations that suggest that a virus causing severe cases of atypical pneumonia already existed in mid‐December 2019 in China (Guo et al., 2020), possibly even in Italy, in France, and in the United States in January 2020 not initially ascribed to COVID‐19.
It could well be that early ancestors of SARS‐CoV‐2, producing asymptomatic infections had already spread before causing clinical—COVID‐19—disease (Forster et al., 2020).
In Wuhan hospitals, the healthcare personnel observed that the clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 patients at the onset of the disease became progressively different, possibly as new coronavirus variants emerged and spread over time and generations.
We have tried to summarize here reasons to hope for a positive outcome of the outbreak of COVID‐2, namely via progressive attenuation of the virus (Armengaud et al., 2020).
Thus, besides this optimistic exit from the COVID‐19 epidemic, we should be concerned by the high recombination potential of the virus, which may erase the mutations that allowed it to evolve towards attenuation.
Monitoring as a function of time the genome sequences in closely related cases is critical to anticipate the future of SARS‐CoV‐2 and hence of COVID‐19.
