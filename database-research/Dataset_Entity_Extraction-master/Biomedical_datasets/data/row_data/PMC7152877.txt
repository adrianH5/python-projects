The rapid advance of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased mortality but also has demonstrated considerable potential to negatively impact mental health, including in the young [1,2].
Perhaps no group of individuals with mental illness is as directly affected by the worsening outbreak of COVID-19 as people living with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
For others, COVID-19 is likely to cast a long shadow, as people of all ages with OCD are known to be particularly inflexible at ‘unlearning’ danger responses when they become obsolete [6,7] and thereby conditioned to prolonged virus-induced distress and anxiety.
Confirm the diagnosis of OCD, paying particular attention to other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) including hypochondriasis (recently endorsed as an OCRD in the World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-11) [8], as these disorders are likely to be most affected by COVID-19.
It is also important not to assume that every patient with contamination fears related to germs and illness will necessarily be excessively concerned about COVID-19.
In particular, note WHO ICD-11 guidelines regarding mental health and psychosocial considerations during the COVID-19 outbreak [1].
Additional COVID-related factors found anecdotally to potentially increase suicidal risk include a recent increase in OCD severity, experiencing a family member found positive for COVID-19 or finding the effects of quarantine or isolation distressing.
Review medication status as a priority: Based on the risks associated with exposure and response prevention (ERP) in the pandemic (see below), and uncertainty as to which of the two evidence-based treatments, pharmacotherapy or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), represents the most efficacious first line treatment modality [11], pharmacotherapy should be the first option for adults and children with OCD with contamination, washing or cleaning symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.
