As an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged during the manuscript review process, we rapidly incorporated a new test for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 into a coronavirus panel taken from the HV panel, demonstrating the power of this modular master set to be adapted to real-world challenges (Fig. 2d).
For 4-channel datasets, analysis of 3-colour space was performed directly on normalized intensities.
For 5-channel datasets, droplets were divided into UV intensity bins for downstream analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4).
For 5-channel datasets, UV intensity bins were recombined after assignments to create the full dataset.
For 167 of the 169 HV10 species, it was possible to design primer sets using ADAPT/primer3 that cover >90% of the genomes in the database with fewer than 10 primer pairs.
We improved our design approach throughout the process by incorporating new features into each round of design.
In the work presented here, the radius of the sliding distance filter was set to achieve at least 99.5% correct classification in the test dataset, corresponding to the removal of 6% of droplets.
Using CARMENâ€“Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
