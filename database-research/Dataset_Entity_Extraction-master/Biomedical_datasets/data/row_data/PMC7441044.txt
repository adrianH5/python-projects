All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequences in the final dataset from May 2020 were copied into a separate FASTA file (n = 778 sequences), then 100 bases were trimmed from the 5′ and 3’ ends of each sequence to remove low-quality degenerate nucleotides.
To assess the inclusivity of oligonucleotides from these assays, we curated a dataset of 15,001 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from specimens collected between Dec 31, 2019 and May 31, 2020.
The composition of the dataset by region and collection month is shown in Fig. 1
.
Using PCR_strainer, we identified genomes in our dataset with nucleotide mismatches in locations targeted by the early SARS-CoV-2 LDTs described above.
Two sets of oligonucleotides had mismatches against all 15,001 SARS-CoV-2 reference genomes in our dataset: the Charité group’s RdRP gene assay and the Japan NIID’s N gene assay.
One of these variants, which we will call the ‘AAC’ variant, was present in 18.8 % of genomes in our dataset (Table 3).
Next, we constructed a phylogeny of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes in our dataset from May 2020, the most recent completed month at the time of writing (Fig. 4
).
Furthermore, this clade closely overlapped with the GISAID ‘GR’ clade: 99.5 % of genomes with the ‘AAC’ variant were identified as members of Clade ‘GR’, and 100 % of genomes identified as members of clade ‘GR’ contained the ‘AAC’ variant.
Single mismatches in the Charité group and Japan NIID assays were uniform and pervasive, suggesting they were artefacts of the oligonucleotide design process.
The mismatch in the Japan NIID’s assay was due to an error in the first reported SARS-CoV-2 genome assembly, and investigations by the assay’s designers did not find any impact on clinical performance [11].
Mismatches in the Charité group and Japan NIID assays were both 14 positions from the more-crucial 3’ end of the primers.
Indeed, as stated above, the Japan NIID group failed to observe a difference in detection between primers with and without the mismatch [11].
