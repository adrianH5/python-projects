The recent pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become one of the major health concerns of the 21st century [1].
Therefore, drug-repurposing attempts aimed at identification of efficient therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19 has emerged as a promising approach to compensate for this urgent need.
Studies were selected as they provide the latest curated data regarding the dataset.
The effect of USP13 (Affymetrix ID: 226902_at) mRNA expression levels on overall survival was assessed via Kaplan-Meier Plotter (https://kmplot.com/analysis/) [21].
In order to analyze the effect of USP13 somatic copy number alterations on immune cell infiltration, TIMER analysis was performed on all TCGA datasets, which showed significant correlation in Head-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC), LUAD, LUSC, STAD and OV tumors (Fig. 4
).
COVID-19 is currently one of the most urgent health issues that need immediate attention worldwide.
One explanation for this unexpected result could be that different analyses might have been run on different datasets for the same cancer type.
