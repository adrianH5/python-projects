With the current outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) [1]
, debates are taking place around the consequences this pandemic would have on different aspects of the human health including obesity.
During this critical period of COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health is among what health professionals are most concerned about.
Within the context of diet choice, the socioeconomic crisis expected to develop during and after the current COVID-19 crisis [18], [19] would lead to inflation of different products prices.
Moreover, patients who get the respiratory illness of COVID-19 might have reduced lung function [21], [22] (possibly even after they recover), which would limit their ability to perform physical activity due to the respiratory failure.
Herein, we have illustrated how selected COVID-19 pandemic-related concepts do increase obesity risk and therefore multiple obesity-related morbidities including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc [23].
Obesity and those morbidities resulting from measures implemented to prevent COVID-19 spread and limit its mortality would, ironically, make the individuals more vulnerable to COVID-19 [24].
Importantly, it is of an extreme importance to make sure we do not replace COVID-19 pandemic with another pandemic(s) such as obesity which is already epidemic [25].
