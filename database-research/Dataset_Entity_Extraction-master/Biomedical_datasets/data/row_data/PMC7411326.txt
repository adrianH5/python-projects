Without effective management, COVID-19 could be catastrophic in Africa, exacerbated by high infectious and non-infectious disease burdens, poor healthcare access and limited health resources.
4 5 African COVID-19 disease profiles may also differ given unique regional environmental challenges, population structure and genetic make-up, and potential proliferation of specific virus strains, limiting transferability of research findings from other continents.
In this novel COVID-19 pandemic, IRBs have no recourse to historical evidence, and require support in both decision-making challenges and a greatly increased workload.
Previous pandemic experience has informed recommendations for strengthening and expediting IRB processes,11 12 members of the scientific community can be co-opted to assess proposals for scientific integrity, and government offices and scientific organisations can provide guidelines for acceptable practices (eg, African Academy of Sciences COVID-19 research ethics, https://www.aasciences.africa/).
Maximising benefit to patient populations is essential for ethical COVID-19 research in Africa, given limited healthcare capacity.
Non-traditional engagement of community members provided in local languages by local fieldworkers must accommodate potentially limited resources available to participants and researchers, for example, using call-back short message services (SMS), toll-free numbers for information, printed materials and free-data websites combining information about COVID-19 public health measures and proposed studies.
Locally relevant COVID-19 health promotion information and links to local psycho-social support should also be provided.
Existing datasets may be retrospectively analysed, or used as control data for COVID-19 studies where ethics approval is in place.
Such data can be anonymised, de-identified, perturbed and aggregated to be useful comparison datasets without compromising participants; or new consent can be sought for repurposing existing data.
