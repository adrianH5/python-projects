Of note, the recent outbreak of Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a cluster of pneumonia in humans caused by SARS-CoV-2, turned into a public health emergency of international concern (Sun et al. 2020).
Although our discrete phylogeographic inference results currently do not implicate geographic distance or hog population sizes in farms as drivers of spatial spread, more comprehensive sampling and incorporating additional predictors at different levels (county, prefecture, or province) may elucidate important spatial dynamics in the future.
The continuous phylogeographic reconstruction that incorporates a directional tendency suggests a southern origin for PDCoV spread in China.
A total of 119 genome sequences and 220 S gene sequences were used, along with 21 newly sequenced genomes (GenBank accession numbers in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online) and 29 newly sequenced S gene (GenBank accession numbers: MN058045–MN058073) sequences, respectively.
We first assessed temporal signal in our data sets using TempEst (Rambaut et al. 2016) and continued to assess the best fitting model through marginal likelihood estimation using path-sampling and stepping-stone estimation approaches.
