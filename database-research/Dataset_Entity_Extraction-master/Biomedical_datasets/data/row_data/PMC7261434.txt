The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral pandemic that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst respiratory disease outbreak of the generation, if not a century, and currently crippling the entire global fabric of the human socioeconomic life.
With no known efficacious therapy for COVID-19, repurposing other known antiviral drugs and pathologies related to the lethal episode of COVID-19 are our best approach for rigorous experimental (in vitro and in vivo) tests and clinical trials.
Good examples of antiviral drugs with protease and polymerase mechanism of action are indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, which gained attention in recent weeks for clinical trial of COVID-19 infection (1).
On these bases, studies on the potential of viral helicase inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 is well justified.
Highlighting the experience gained from targeting Nsp13 in similar coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS) and known inhibitors, the article calls for research on helicase inhibitors as potential COVID-19 therapy.
