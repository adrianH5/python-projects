The disease was recognized to be caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The symptoms of COVID-19 range from fever, dry cough, fatigue, congestion, sore throat, and diarrhea to severe interstitial bilateral pneumonia with a ground-glass image at the CT scan.
All these data were inserted in a section of the established and certified Biobank and Registry of the Medical Genetics Unit of the Hospital dedicated to COVID-19.
The cohort of COVID-19 patients consists of 131 individuals out of whom 34 females and 97 males belonging to the GEN-COVID MULTICENTER STUDY ([16], Late Breaking Abstract ESHG 2020.2 Virtual Conference “WES profiling of COVID-19”).
The genome aggregation database gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) was used to assess allele frequency for each variant among different populations.
(PDB ID code 1R42) [24].
MD simulations were performed using a high parallel computing infrastructure (HPCS) with 660 cpu within 21 different nodes, 190T of RAM, 30T hard disk partition size, and six NVIDIA TESLA gpu with CUDA support.
The c.2158A>G p.(Asn720Asp) substitution was estimated to have a frequency of 0.011 (103/9689 alleles), which is in line with the frequency of the variant reported in the gnomAD database (0.016), and is lower than the frequency reported in gnomAD for the European non-Finnish population (0.025, 2195/87966 analyzed alleles).
In addition to these variants, 28 rare missense variants were identified, out of which ten had not previously been reported in GnomAD database and nine truncating variants that had not been reported in gnomAD database (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
In order to shed light on the role of ACE2 variants on interindividual variability and susceptibility to COVID-19 in Italian population we performed WES analysis on a cohort of 131 patients and 258 controls who agreed in participating to the study (see “Materials and methods”).
A silent variant the c.2247G>A p.V749V, was also detected in 26 control individuals (allele frequency 0.069) compared with five COVID-19 patients (allele frequency 0.030).
Italy has been the first European country that experienced the COVID-19 outbreak with a rapid increase in the positive cases in a very short-time period and a morbidity and lethality (~10%) definitely higher in comparison with Asian countries, such as China (4%) and South Korea (1.2%) [32].
WES data generated from a wide cohort of COVID-19 Italian patients revealed a statistically significant (P < 0,029) higher allelic heterogeneity for ACE2 in controls compared with patients with a higher chance to find at least one ACE2 variant in the cohort of controls compared with the cohort of patients.
A human-to-human transmission was assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was described.
These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed interindividual clinical variability associated with COVID-19, allowing an evidence-based risk assessment leading to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options.
