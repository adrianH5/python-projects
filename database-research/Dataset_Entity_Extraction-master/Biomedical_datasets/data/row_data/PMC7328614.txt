Similar to its predecessors, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2,3], infection with SARS-CoV-2 (officially named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020) can manifest as bronchitis, pneumonia, or a severe respiratory illness.
To generate a composite phylogenetic tree, we randomly removed sequences to create a dataset proportional to these newly isolated sequences, keeping in mind that the homologous sequences remain in the final alignment.
The evolutionary relationships of these newly sequenced Saudi MERS-CoV isolates were assessed in combination with the globally isolated sequences available in the GenBank database (Figs. 1,2
).
