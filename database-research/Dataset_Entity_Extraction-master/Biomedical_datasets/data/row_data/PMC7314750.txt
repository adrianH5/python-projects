We quantified virus infectivity with the 50% tissue culture infectious dose TCID50 assay, and estimated the corresponding plaque forming units (PFU)/ml using the conversion PFU/ml = 0.7 TCID50
.
The results are reported as the estimate plaque forming units (PFU)/ml using the conversion PFU/ml = 0.7 TCID50
 by applying the Poisson distribution.
It is also important to note that the previous results with H1N1 virus utilized a fluorescent focus assay to assess virus survival in contrast to this work which used the TCID50 assay.
While both assays are widely used to accurately determine viral infectivity, the former employs immunofluorescence to detect a specific viral antigen, instead of depending on cytopathic effects as in the TCID50 assay.
