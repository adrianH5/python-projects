Finally, World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as Corona Viruses Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Third, this number of peak list associated with the abstract number of peaks obtained by in-silico digestion using various databases.
So, we selected a medicinal plant and a drug to check its activity against COVID-19.
HCQ is also included in the triallist to treat COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
There is theoretical, experimental, preclinical, and clinical evidence of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients affected with COVID-19.
The whole genome sequence of novel coronavirus was obtained through NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with accession no: MN908947.3, 29,903bp in length and described as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 originated from Wuhan-Hu-1 on 18 March 2020 (Kruse, 2020).
This server determines the active peptides by comparing the calculated peak lists with already existing masses of peptides in the database, resulting in the active peptides with additional information.
We picked Swissprot for the search database because it is nonredundant and fairly small, helpful for statistically meaningful matches (Bairoch and Apweiler, 2000).
MASCOT database identifies the viruses and proteins which contain the matched peptides sequences along with complete annotation.
So, from the aforementioned findings, it is confirmed that the chosen antiviral compounds are effective inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can help the immune system to fight against COVID-19 (Figures 5 and 6).
An rare pandemic of viral pneumonia occurs in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which is now recognized internationally as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the etiological agent classified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Molecular peptide docking with Moringa oleifera, phytochemicals (aqueous and ethanolic) leaf extracts of flavonoids (3.56 ± 0.03), (3.83 ± 0.02), anthraquinone (11.68 ± 0.04), (10.86 ± 0.06) and hydroxychloroquine present therapy of COVID-19 in Pakistan for comparative study.
In conclusion, it is proposed that these compounds are effective antiviral agents against COVID-19 and can be used in clinical trials.
