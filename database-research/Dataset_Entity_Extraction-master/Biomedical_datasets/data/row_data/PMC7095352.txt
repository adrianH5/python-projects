The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the 2019-nCoV infection) in December 2019 is one of the most severe public health emergencies since the founding of Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1949.
Sadly, as of February 20, 2020, over two thousand COVID-19 cases are confirmed among HCP from 476 hospitals nationwide, with nearly 90% of them from Hubei Province.
The experience and lessons learned should be a valuable asset for international health community to contain the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic around the world.
