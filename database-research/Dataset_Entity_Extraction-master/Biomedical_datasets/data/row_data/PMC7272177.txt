In late December 2019 in Wuhan city (China), a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (initially nCoV-2019) caused the outbreak of a respiratory disease known as the infectious disease due to the new coronavirus (COVID-19) (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020).
In Colombia, the first case of COVID-19 was identified on March 6, 2020, shortly before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic after it had spread in 114 countries in all continents and having claimed the lives of 4291 people (WHO, 2020a).
The first case of COVID-19 in Colombia was imported from Italy, a country that had the most alarming epidemic peak in Europe at that time.
Shortly afterwards, cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in travelers from other origins, as well as in multiple of their contacts.
After the publication of the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome in genomic data repositories such as NCBI (MN908947.3) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) in mid-January 2020, health agencies and researchers from different countries quickly developed SARS-CoV-2 screening tests based on real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) that amplify different SARS-CoV-2 gene regions.
A total of 39 primer and probe sequences from the main in-house rRT-PCR protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection published at WHO website were aligned to the reference sequence derived from the first confirmed case at Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and named Wuhan-1 strain (GenBank Accession Number: NC_045512.2).
The Corman-Berlin (2020) RdRP SARSr-F2 (Corman et al., 2020) (Fig. 3) region was variable in one Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequence from the department of Valle del Cauca (ID: 79943), involving a critical site at the 3′ pentamer.
The Zhu 2020 CDC-China Set I Probe(ORF1ab) (Zhu et al., 2020) (Fig. 4) was found to be almost completely complementary with the Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences, except for a viral sequence obtained from a human case in the department of Antioquia (ID: 79253), bearing a single substitution at the seventh probe position, without considerable effect on the thermodynamic features for probe-target hybridization (Table S1).
The primers and probes sets proposed by Pasteur 2020 (France)nCoV IP2 (Fig. S1), Hong Kong (2020) HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Fig. S2), Corman Berlin(2020) E Sarbeco (Fig. S3), CDC 2020(USA) 2019-nCoV N1 (Fig. S4), DMC-MH 2020(Thailand)WH-NIC N (Fig. S4), CDC 2020(USA) 2019-nCoV N3 (Fig. S5), Corman Berlin(2020) N Sarbeco (Fig. S5), Nao 2020(Japan)NIID 2019-nCOV N (Fig. S6) and CDC 2020(USA) 2019-nCoV N2 (Fig. S6) showed correspondence with the reference sequence and with all the accumulated genetic variability in available sequences of Colombian strains of SARS-CoV-2.
One of the primers (Nao 2020(Japan)NIID 2019-nCOV N F2) had the 3′ end aligned with the first codon position of the codon CUA which encodes for alanine.
NGS has also enabled pathogen discovery in a timely manner compared to traditional methods, being essential to the virus taxonomic classification during the beginnings of COVID-19 pandemics (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020).
By the time of this report, more than 31.000 sequences have been made available on GISAID by researchers across the globe; in line with the “Common primer check for high-quality genomes 2020-05-22” analysis from this database (BII/GIS, 2020), the Zhu 2020 CDC-China Set II (N) showed the higher percent of genomes with mutation in both, the entire -and the 3′ end primer region, which can affect the sensitivity of this protocol given the genetic variability present in the country.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using nucleic acid amplification techniques such as rRT-PCR continues to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020d).
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health problem unprecedented in the recent history of humanity.
Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country.
Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated.
Highlights     •  Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences displayed genetic variability in some target regions used for COVID-19 diagnosis.
•  Genomic data of circulating SARS-CoV-2 allow the refinement of molecular protocols for COVID-19 diagnosis
