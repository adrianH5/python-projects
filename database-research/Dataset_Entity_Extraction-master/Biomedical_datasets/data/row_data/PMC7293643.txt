We appreciate the constructive comments from Kesici et al. (1) and Zeng et al. (2), which mainly focus on the key points about the optimal procedure of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy and about how to improve the effectiveness.
Indeed, the adverse effect was minor, whereas a quickly improved outcome of 10 severe COVID-19 patients was observed.
Second, the objective for CP transfusion in severe COVID-19 therapy is based on an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms.
Particularly, in severe or critical COVID-19 cases, lung alveolar macrophages or epithelial cells could produce various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the infection site to clear the virus particles and infected cells, resulting in uncontrolled inflammation.
Thus, monitoring the dynamic changes of interleukin-6 level, which was significantly elevated in COVID-19, may help to determine the optimal treatment time, generally within 2 wk.
The median duration of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients was 12.0 d (10).
In our study, all of the donors were recovered from the common type of COVID-19.
