The virus was soon identified as novel CoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), more recently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while the associated disease is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
As of 15 June 2020, there were almost 8 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 431,541 deaths globally (2).
(A) Schematic diagram of the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession no. MN908947) and human CoV-19/Singapore/12/2020 (hCoV-19/Singapore/12/2020) Δ382 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_414378).
To investigate the possible origin and evolutionary relationships of these Δ382 viruses, a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 full genomes was inferred from serially sampled data sets.
We then tested residual diagnostic samples from COVID-19 patients in Singapore for the presence of Δ382 viruses to understand the epidemiological fitness of Δ382 viruses.
Full complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and Δ382 viruses generated in Singapore were deposited in the GISAID database (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
All available genomes of SARS-CoV-2 with associated virus sampling dates were downloaded from the GISAID database.
To reduce bias from locations with higher virus sampling and genome availability, data sets were subsampled randomly based on geographical location and collection month using in-house scripts.
To reconstruct a time-scaled phylogeny, we analyzed serially sampled data sets of 419 complete genomes (Table S5) using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed-clock (UCLN) model with an exponential growth coalescent prior and the HKY85+Γ substitution model in BEAST program v1.10.4 (29) to simultaneously estimate phylogenies, divergence times, and rates of nucleotide substitution.
The strict and UCLN models were recently tested by Duchene et al. (30), who showed that the UCLN model is preferred over a strict clock for analyzing large (>122) SARS-CoV-2 genome data sets.
Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens were detected using a COVID-19 convalescent human serum at a 1:400 dilution in PBS for 30 min at 37°C.
Supernatant was harvested daily for 6 days following infection and 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) titers were determined.
Sequences generated in this study have been deposited in the GISAID database (see Table S1 for accession numbers).
