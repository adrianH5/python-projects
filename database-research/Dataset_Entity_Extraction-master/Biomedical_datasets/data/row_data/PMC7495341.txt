In addition, upon entering into cells, exogenous RNAs need to escape from endosomal trapping and/or degradation by large classes of intracellular ribonucleases or RNases (e.g., endonucleases, and 5′ and 3′ exonucleases), become incorporated into specific complex, and get access to the targets (Fig. 1) to exercise pharmacological effects.
Although IVT is unable to specifically assemble post-transcriptionally modified or natural nucleosides into an mRNA molecule at particular sites, and the effects of such modifications on the efficiency of intracellular translation remain obscure, systemic incorporation of pseudouridine (Karikó et al., 2008) or N1-methyl-pseudouridine (Svitkin et al., 2017) into mRNA substances could be achieved by IVT reactions, leading to an improvement of translational capacity and biological stability, as compared with unmodified counterparts.
Entrapment of a ligand can stabilize the incorporation of the switching sequence into the aptamer domain, and thus the expression platform is induced to fold into a specific structure to modulate the expression of genes controlling the biosynthesis and transport of metabolites (Serganov and Nudler, 2013; Hallberg et al., 2017).
