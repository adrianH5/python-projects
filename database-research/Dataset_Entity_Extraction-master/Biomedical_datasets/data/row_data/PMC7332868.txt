Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a recent pandemic outbreak, which was first reported in Wuhan (Hubei province), China, causing novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), resulted in more than 298,000 deaths, as on 14th May 2020.
Even though COVID-19 presents relatively mild symptoms compared to the recent outbreaks like Ebola or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), they are highly transmissible and can lead to severe pneumonia and death (Boopathi et al., 2020; DiMaio et al., 2020).
In this study, we have modeled SARS-CoV-2 N7-MTase protein structure in order to decipher the molecular architecture of the substrate-binding site and to perform virtual screening and docking analysis to identify an attractive and novel lead compound from TCM@Taiwan database, which can assist researchers in designing a potent antiviral drug against COVID-19 by blocking the SARS-CoV-2’s RNA capping mechanism required for evading the host defense.
Amino acid flipping is incorporated for side-chains angles of amino acids (Asn, Gln, and His) and it may influence the hydrogen bond formation and generate tautomer/ionized states (Sastry et al., 2013).
For ligand preparation, the substrate of the Guanine-N7 methyltransferase namely G3A (Guanosine-P3-Adenosine-5′,5′-Triphosphate) is downloaded from the PubChem (ID: 135450590) and for screening approaches, 22122 molecules from TCM Database@Taiwan is used (Ma et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).
In order to identify the appropriate compounds that perfectly fits the substrate-binding site of the G3A, the Glide incorporated virtual screening protocol is used (Grover et al., 2012; Kawatkar et al., 2009; Muralidharan et al., 2020).
The whole database is initially screened with High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS), for identifying appropriate compounds that fit in the substrate-binding site (Lobo-Galo et al., 2020; Patidar et al., 2016).
The experimental structure of the Guanine-N7 methyltransferase enzyme is unavailable in the PDB and BLASTp results suggest the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV nsp14-nsp10 complex (PDB ID: 5c8s) as the template for structure modeling.
To disturb the G3A binding towards the Asn388, the whole TCM database is searched for a suitable compound using the HTVS method.
The XP docking and Prime MM/GBSA provides the TCM 57025 (5a), TCM 3495 (5b), TCM 20111 (5c), TCM 31007 (5d) and TCM 5376 (5e) from the TCM database as the best compounds that can bind with the substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 N7-MTase as shown in Figure 5(a–e).
For tackling Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), researchers from around the world are swiftly working on designing and identifying inhibitors against all possible viral key protein targets.
For an in-depth understanding of these substrate specificities, we tried to screen and identify inhibitors from the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) database.
We strongly believe the final compounds can become COVID-19 therapeutics, with huge international support.
Therefore, our study proposes the top hit compounds from the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) database using a combination of several computational approaches.
