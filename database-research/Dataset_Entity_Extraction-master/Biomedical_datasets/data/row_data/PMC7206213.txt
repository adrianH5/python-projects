As of Apr. 22, 2020, the World Health Organization (2020) has reported over 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 169 151 deaths.
Recent articles have uncovered genomic characteristics and clinical features of COVID-19 (Chan et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), while our understanding of COVID-19 is still limited.
As suggested by guidelines promoted by the General Office of National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (2020) (from Versions 1 to 6), discharged standards for COVID-19 were still dependent on viral real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of respiratory specimens, showing that recovered COVID-19 patients with twice negative RT-PCR could meet discharge criteria.
Patient 1, a 40-year-old female, presented with fever and a mild dry cough on Jan. 17, 2020 (Day −4) after contact with a colleague from Wuhan, China, 4 d previously, who was confirmed to have COVID-19.
She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in our center on Jan. 21 (Day 1) with a positive RT-PCR test in sputum and bilateral infiltration lesions on chest CT images (Fig. 1a).
Patient 2, a 50-year-old male, had fever for 8 d and was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Jan. 23, 2020 (Day 1) in our center.
Our study describes two cases with subsequently positive nucleic acid results in patients of COVID-19 who met discharge criteria and this raises concern about the transmission risk associated with discharged COVID-19 patients.
