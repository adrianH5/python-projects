The global outbreak of COVID-19 has emerged as a severe threat to human health (–).
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus that causes symptoms such as cough, headache, dyspnea, myalgia, fever, and severe pneumonia in humans (, –).
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein–targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with potent neutralizing activity are a focus in the development of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 (–).
We isolated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 convalescent COVID-19 patients.
This points to the NTD as a promising target for therapeutic mAbs against COVID-19.
