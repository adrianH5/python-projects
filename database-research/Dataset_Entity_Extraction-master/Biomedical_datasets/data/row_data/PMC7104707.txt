The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 [1].
The causative agent of the current outbreak, which has originated in Wuhan City in China, was identified as a novel coronavirus on January 7, 2020 [5], and the disease has been named COVID-19.
Many countries worldwide are making every effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
The probable transmission from individuals before the onset of symptoms or very early minimal symptoms makes COVID-19 much more difficult to control.
Beside the protracted conflicts in many countries in the region, lack of infrastructure, limited resources, inadequate prevention control practices, poor preparedness capacity, and inadequate laboratory infrastructures and resources in many countries in the EMR are among the main barriers to adequately detect and respond to COVID-19.
Not only has it created a page titled “COVID-19 Updates” to post hourly updates on the virus and its spread, but it has also created a private group titled “FETP Professionals,” which serves as a space for FETP directors, advisors, and coordinators to discuss key issues of concern in this regard.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.
This viewpoint article aims to highlight the contribution of the Global Health Development (GHD)/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) and the EMR’s Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETPs) to prepare for and respond to the current COVID-19 threat.
It is essential that GHD/EMPHNET and FETPs continue building the capacity to respond to COVID-19 and intensify support for preparedness and response to public health emergencies.
