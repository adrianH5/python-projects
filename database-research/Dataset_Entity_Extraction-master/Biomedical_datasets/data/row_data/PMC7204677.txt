Travel-associated cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported outside of China as early as January 13, 2020, and the virus has subsequently spread to nearly all nations (World Health Organization, 2020a, World Health Organization, 2020b).
The majority of early COVID-19 cases in the United States were (1) associated with travel to a “high-risk” country or (2) close contacts of previously identified cases according to the testing criteria adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b).
From March 1–19, 2020, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the United States rapidly increased from 74 to 13,677, and the virus was detected in all 50 states (Dong et al., 2020).
It was recently estimated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States is likely in the tens of thousands (Perkins et al., 2020), suggesting substantial undetected infections and spread within the country.
We hypothesized that, with the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the United States and the large volume of domestic travel, new United States outbreaks are now more likely to result from interstate rather than international spread.
To delineate the roles of domestic and international virus spread in the emergence of new United States COVID-19 outbreaks, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses collected from cases identified in Connecticut.
We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from nine of the first COVID-19 cases reported in Connecticut, with sample collection dating from March 6–14, 2020 (Data S1).
We shared the genomes of these viruses publicly as we generated them (GISAID EPI_ISL_416416-416424).
We combined our genomes with other publicly available sequences for a final dataset of 168 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Figure 1; Data S2).
The dataset can be visualized on our “community” Nextstrain page (https://nextstrain.org/community/grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper1).
Regardless, neither the CT-Yale-001 nor the CT-Yale-006 COVID-19 cases were travel-associated, which indicates that these patients were part of domestic transmission chains that stemmed from undetected introductions.
Importantly, our data indicate that, by early to mid-March, there had already been interstate spread during the early COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.
Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut was driven, in part, by domestic virus introductions.
(E) We calculated importation risk by modeling the number of daily prevalent COVID-19 cases in each potential importation source and then estimating the number of infected travelers using the daily air travel volume from each location.
We first estimated daily passenger volumes arriving in the region from the five countries (China, Italy, Iran, Spain, and Germany) and out-of-region states (Washington, California, Florida, Illinois, and Louisiana) that have reported the most COVID-19 cases to date (Figures 2A–2D).
We found that the daily domestic passenger volumes were ∼100 times greater than international in Hartford, ∼10 times greater in Boston, and ∼4 times greater in New York in our dataset (Figure 2B).
By combining daily passenger volumes (Figure 2B) with COVID-19 prevalence at the travel route origin (Figures 2C and 2D) and accounting for differences in reporting rates, we found that the domestic and international SARS-CoV-2 importation risk started to increase dramatically at the beginning of March 2020 (Figure 2E).
Because of the overall low prevalence of COVID-19 in China, we did not find any significant effects of travel restrictions from China that were enacted on February 1 (Data S3).
The dramatic rises in domestic and international importation risk preceded the state-wide COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut (Figure 2E), and the recent increase in risk of domestic importation may give rise to new outbreaks in the region.
We therefore propose that a unified effort to detect and prevent new COVID-19 cases will be essential for mitigating the risk of future domestic outbreaks.
If spread between states is now occurring, as our results indicate, then the United States will struggle to control COVID-19 in the absence of a unified surveillance strategy.
To investigate the origin and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Connecticut, we compiled a dataset of our nine genomes with another 159 representative sample of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were available from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/).
No data that was only released on GISAID was used without consent from the authors (see Acknowledgments).

Daily COVID-19 cases from international locations were obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control via Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data).
Daily COVID-19 cases from Connecticut and other U.S. locations (Washington, California, Florida, Illinois, and Louisiana) were obtained from the repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (Dong et al., 2020).
These represent the international and out-of-region domestic (i.e., excluding New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey) locations with the most reported COVID-19 cases.
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March.
To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut.
Graphical Abstract      Highlights     •  Connecticut’s COVID-19 outbreak resulted from multiple domestic virus introductions    •  SARS-CoV-2 genomic data indicate that coast-to-coast spread occurred in the United States    •  Risk of introduction by domestic air travel exceeded international travel in March    •  Restrictions on international travel did not significantly alter risk estimates      Using genomics and air travel information, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States from coast to coast is shown to be more a consequence of domestic introductions than of international travel.
