It is worth mentioning that each Baltimore’s group is represented in the human, non-human primate, avian and fish viral sequence data sets, albeit in different proportions (Fig 3A).
This depletion is shared in all viral datasets while the NTC depletion is specific to a subpopulation of human and non-human primate viral sequences.
The APOBEC family of genes also counts the AID (or AICDA), APOBEC1, APOBEC2 and APOBEC4 genes.
AID is critical for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination by editing the immunoglobulin loci in B cells [39].
Importantly, APOBEC1 and AID appear also to participate to the restriction of viruses and retroelements [1,42].
Evidence for AID and APOBEC1 evolutionary footprints were investigated by looking for the depletion of their favored motifs, respectively WRC for AID [43] and WCW for APOBEC1 [44].
The distributions of the WRC and NNGYWN ratios do not point towards viruses significantly footprinted by AID at the whole genome level (S10B Fig).
Nevertheless, putatively AID-footprinted genes were identified in several double strand DNA viruses, notably the B-cell-infecting virus EBV (S10C Fig).
Finally, we identified several AID-footprinted genes in the EBV genome which supports recent observations made by Martinez et al. [33].
Those genes are not spatially clustered and further investigation would be necessary to link the detected footprint to AID activity.
We downloaded complete viral genomes from the “NCBI Virus” database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) as released in April 2020.
We retrieved non-human primate viruses by selecting “Primate” for the criterion “Host” and by deducting the human viruses from this data set.
The dataset of Human viruses was supplemented by manually curated human virus complete genome sequences from the “NCBI nucleotide” database.
GenBank accession ID’s are treated as unique and listed in the S1, S2 and S3 Tables.
