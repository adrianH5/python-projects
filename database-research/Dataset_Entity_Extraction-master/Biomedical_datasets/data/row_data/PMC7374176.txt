Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a CoV identified as the causal agent of the respiratory epidemic first detected in China (Wuhan) and subsequently declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the COVID-19 pandemics due to the spread of the outbreak to other countries worldwide (Lai et al., 2020; Zheng, 2020).
COVID-19 has caused a significant loss in human lives and has resulted in a tremendous economic damage across the five continents (Ahn et al., 2020).
At present, there is no accurate therapy for COVID-19 though some medications such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (Wright et al., 2020), combinations of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments (Stebbing et al., 2020), traditional Chinese medicine (Ren et al., 2020) and other therapeutics (Ahn et al., 2020; Elfiky, 2020) have been proposed.
The development of vaccines against COVID-9 is also at its infancy (Ahmed et al., 2020; Prompetchara et al., 2020; Robson, 2020).
Due to the extent of the pandemic, experimental research on COVID-19 vaccine candidates and therapeutics as well as the identification of suitable experimental models are needed to limit the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
With the outbreak of COVID-19, scientists have put forward effort to analyze the codon usage bias of CoVs in order to improve our understanding on the emergence, adaptation, spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (Tort et al., 2020).
As a systems biology approach, network-pharmacology has been also used for evaluating the potential of traditional Chinese medicines against COVID-19 (Yu et al., 2020).
In silico prediction of drug candidates against COVID-19 has been also proposed on the basis of Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) regulatory network (Cava et al., 2020); however, this prediction had no direct connection with viral infection.
To the best of our knowledge, systems biology approaches based on codon usage co-adaptation between SARS-CoV-2 and its human host as well as SARS-CoV-2-induced differential gene expression have not been applied for discovering potential therapeutics for COVID-19 and other respiratory CoVs.
Hence, the primary purpose of the present study was to use systems biology approaches for analyzing the codon usage profile of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in order to provide useful molecular data for the development of attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strains that may have vaccine potential against COVID-19 and a broader applicability for CoVs.
Finally, based on our knowledge of these genes, we also aimed to predict, in silico, the potential drugs for the treatment of the ongoing COVID-19 in particular, and CoV infection in general.
Based on the model of CAI, ENc-GC3 and RSCU of the three CoVs, we uncovered the functional role of CoV-responsive human genes and how respiratory CoVs affect human genes, and revealed a useful set of drugs that could guide practitioners in strategical monitoring of COVID-19.
The full-length CDS sequences of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were downloaded from the NCBI virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/) database.
The gene expression dataset GSE147507 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) containing the gene expression of human cells transfected or untransfected with SARS-CoV-2 was downloaded from the GEO database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
The viruSITE (http://www.virusite.org/), a database of viral genomes and genes (Stano et al., 2016), was used for analyzing the sequences of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV based on the reference sequences deposited in this database.
PCA is a multivariate analysis approach that is used for geometrical plotting of sets of columns and rows in a given dataset (Wold et al., 1987).
In order to examine the genomic similarity of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, similarity analysis was performed using the viruSITE database.
Using the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb), we identified drug candidates targeting the potential human genes affected by viral infection.
Among the remaining genes we found hydroxychloroquine (3 target genes) and chloroquine (2 target genes) which have been recently proposed as therapeutics for COVID-19.
We inferred that the list of drugs found in this study could be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
This approach could be adopted in the search for vaccines against respiratory viruses such as the SARS-CoV2 responsible for COVID-19.
Currently, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is unknown.
In addition, recent studies have reported that segmental pulmonary emboli (hemoptysis) occurs in COVID-19 infection (Casey et al., 2020), which corroborated with our finding that the pathway of hematopoietic cell lineage is potentially dysregulated in CoV infections.
Currently, there is no precise therapy for treating the ongoing COVID-19.
Here, we predicted a set of drugs that could be efficient in the treatment of COVID-19 and other CoV infections.
In the early search of treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers have proposed hydroxycholoroquine and chloroquine as treatment for COVID-19 (Singh et al., 2020).
Our study also predicted these drugs as a treatment for COVID-19 and other CoV infections.
Thus, we believe that its administration to CoV-infected patients will probably be salutary for patients especially due to the fact that studies have demonstrated that the neuroinvasive ability of SARS-CoV2 is partially associated with the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients (Li et al., 2020).
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths worldwide and has become an urgent public health concern.
Herein, based on publicly available genomic data, we analyzed the codon usage co-adaptation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs) with their human host, identified CoV-responsive human genes and their functional roles on the basis of both the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)-based correlation of viral genes with human genes and differential gene expression analysis, and predicted potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment based on these genes.
Using the drug-gene interaction database, we screened a list of drugs that could target these genes as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.
Our findings not only will contribute in vaccine development but also provide a useful set of drugs that could guide practitioners in strategical monitoring of COVID-19.
We recommend practitioners to scrupulously screen this list of predicted drugs in order to authenticate those qualified for treating COVID-19 symptoms.
