Coronaviruses have gained much attention as the causative agents for the outbreaks of human respiratory syndromes such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and most recently coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
In addition, COVID-19 has shown rapid global spread resulting in many infected individuals as cases increase above 1,200,000 and counting (7 April 2020) [1].
Analysis of the SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) sequence indicated that it shows 77.2% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV (SARS) with the non-structural proteins (nsp's) 7â€“10 showing between 97.1% to 98.8% identity [2].
Coronavirus are the causative agents in many globally concerning respiratory disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
