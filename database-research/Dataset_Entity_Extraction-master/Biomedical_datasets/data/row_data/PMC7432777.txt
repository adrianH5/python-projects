To test the hypothesis and to estimate the extent to which exposition to air pollution can increase the risk of viral infections, we performed a statistical analysis correlating the number of infected people and COVID-19 mortality indexes in the period 20 February–31 March 2020 to the particulate matter (PM)2.5 concentration levels in 110 Italian provinces in the period 16–26 February 2020.
The CAMS near-real-time reanalysis is the most recent global reanalysis data set of atmospheric composition and air quality [14], with a demonstrated unprecedented level of accuracy and space–time resolution.
Data on the population for all Italian provinces has been extracted from the ISTAT Dataset [15], while the number of infected patients has been extracted from the Italian Civil Protection Department database [16].
The number of deaths due to COVID-19 over the time period 20 February–31 March 2020 for the 110 Italian provinces are from the Italian Statistics Institute (ISTAT) report [1].
The “mortality rate” for COVID-19 was defined as the number of deaths normalized to the province population [18], which quantifies the frequency of death occurrence in a defined population.
Surface PM2.5 concentration measurements from ground stations and COVID-19 epidemiology are shown in Figure 3 for the 110 Italian provinces with color-coded maps.
Visual inspection reveals good overlap in the intensity scale between PM2.5 concentration values, averaged over the period 15–26 February 2020 (panel A), and COVID-19 epidemiology over the period 20 February–31 March 2020, e.g., the incidence of COVID-19 cases (panel B), the mortality rate (panel C) and the case fatality rate (panel D).
The correlations between PM2.5 and COVID-19 cases and outcome were statistically significant.
In detail, we found a positive correlation (r = 0.67, p < 0.0001) between the average PM2.5 level in the period 15–26 February 2020 and the incidence of COVID-19 (infected/population ratio) in the period 20 February–31 March 2020 (Figure 4, panel A).
Different reports from China, which was first affected by the pandemic and has relevant pollution problems, found significant links between different pollutants, including PM2.5, and COVID-19 confirmed cases [29,30] and similar associations were evidenced in the United States [31].
In Italy, the association of pollution with increased rates of COVID-19 cases was first proposed by Conticini et al. [32].
Soon after, Fattorini and Regoli [33] demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with various pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) with the number of COVID-19 cases in 71 Italian provinces.
Being confirmatory of previous general results, data from our study give an in-deep look at the strength of correlation between PM2.5 and the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak.
In particular, we performed correlation analysis: (i) considering data from all Italian provinces and (ii) considering the COVID-19 cases and outcomes normalized by the population (incidence and mortality rate) or by the infected population (case fatality risk).
Enhanced persistence of the virus in the air, promotion of a pro-inflammatory state, immune dysregulation, disturbance of pulmonary surfactant homeostasis and increased expression of the viral receptor ACE-2 [36] have been proposed as possible links between air pollution and COVID-19.
The differential expression level of ACE-2 in various human tissues explains the COVID-19 symptomatology: it is extensively expressed in the upper part of the esophagus, in the lung, in enterocytes [37].
Accordingly, the different prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in male and females gave rise to the hypothesis of differential, gender-related expression of ACE-2.
Similarly, ACE-2 up-regulation following treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs such a angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers, has been proposed as contributing to the increased susceptibility of aged peoples to COVID-19 [39].
Notably, following the binding of the viral spike protein, the level of ACE-2 on the cell surface decreases [47], shifting the ACE/ACE-2 balance towards activation of the inflammatory cascade, which represent a hallmark of COVID-19.
The COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic struck health, social and economic systems worldwide, and represents an open challenge for scientists —coping with the high inter-individual variability of COVID-19, and for policy makers —coping with the responsibility to understand environmental factors affecting its severity across different geographical areas.
Air quality and COVID-19 epidemiological data from 110 Italian provinces were studied by correlation analysis, to evaluate the association between particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentrations and incidence, mortality rate and case fatality risk of COVID-19 in the period 20 February–31 March 2020.
Positive correlations between PM 2.5 levels and the incidence (r = 0.67, p < 0.0001), the mortality rate (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001) and the case fatality rate (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001) of COVID-19 were found.
