Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has produced a worldwide panic.
Recent clinical studies have observed digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19,1 possibly because of the enrichment and infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract, mediated by virus receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which suggests the potential for a fecal-oral route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

However, there is still a large gap in the biological knowledge of COVID-19.
Clinical and epidemiologic data of patients with COVID-19 were collected from a continually updated resource.
The transcriptome and proteome derived from bulk tissues and cells were accessed from multiple databases.
A phenome-wide association study data set was supplied for genetic analysis on the ACE2 pathway.
We constructed a user-friendly interface for the visualization of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (https://mulongdu.shinyapps.io/map_covid/;
A similar expression pattern could be found in extra data sets (Figure 1

ACC, adrenocortical carcinoma; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma; BRCA, breast invasive carcinoma; CESC, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma; CHOL, cholangiocarcinoma; COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; DLBC, Lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; ESCA, esophageal carcinoma; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; HNSC, head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma; KICH, kidney chromophobe; KIRC, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma; KIRP, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma; LAML, acute myeloid leukemia; LGG, brain lower-grade glioma; LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; MESO, mesothelioma; ns, no significance; OV, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma; PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma; PCPG, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; PRAD, prostate adenocarcinoma; READ, rectum adenocarcinoma; SARC, sarcoma; SKCM, skin cutaneous melanoma; STAD, stomach adenocarcinoma; TGCT, testicular germ cell tumors; THCA, thyroid carcinoma; THY, thymoma; TPM, transcripts per million; UCEC, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma; UCS, uterine carcinosarcoma; UHR, Universal Human Reference RNA; UVM, uveal melanoma.
We obtained 7 phenotypes related to the intestinal tract and kidney deposited in the phenome-wide association study data set and extracted genome-wide association study summary statistics with more than 3000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms assigned to 33 genes of the ACE2 pathway for the gene set analysis (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 3).
This was corroborated by the clinical observation that the patients with severe cases of COVID-19 were more likely to have a smoking history (22.1%) than those with nonsevere COVID-19 (13.1%).
Nevertheless, renal impairment was common in patients with severe COVID-19, which could be supported by the potential that SARS-CoV-2 damaged renal tubular cells and induced the disruption of the ACE2 pathway referring to ACE2, ACE, ENPEP, TGFB1, THOP1, MAS1, and NLN involved in kidney dysfunction.
It is reasonable to emphasize the monitoring of digestive and excretory system complications in patients with COVID-19 and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route by individuals with suspected infection and asymptomatic carriers (Supplementary Figure 4).
