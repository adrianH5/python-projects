The dataset used for phylogenetic analysis included (n = 54) genomes sequences from the current 2019‐nCoV epidemic plus (n = 2) closely related bat strains (SARS‐like CoV) retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) databases.
Both SS and PS estimators indicated the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock (Bayes factor = 4.3) as the best‐fitted model to the dataset under analysis.
A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019‐nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS‐like CoV) available in GenBank.
