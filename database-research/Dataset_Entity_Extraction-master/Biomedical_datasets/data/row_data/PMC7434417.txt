In December 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China, a megacity with a population of approximately 11 million people.
However, despite these efforts, COVID-19 spread to many countries across the world, reaching pandemic levels, and continues to be a serious public health concern due to its high mortality rate.
With internet search as an important source of epidemiologic information on COVID-19 [4], we performed a combined analysis of the infection rates of these population samples using publicly available data (Table 1), instead of a simple pooled calculation, considering potential differences in lifestyles and pathogen exposure across different populations.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
