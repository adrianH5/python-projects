Chemoinformatics searches from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (2020–3-12) and the ChEMBL25 database on the human interactors yielded 16 approved drugs, 3 investigational new drugs (clinical), and 18 pre-clinical candidates (Supplementary Table 4); while target- and pathway-specific literature search revealed 13 approved drugs, 9 investigational new drugs (clinical), and 10 preclinical candidates (Supplementary Table 5).
Two classes of molecules emerged as effectively reducing viral infectivity: protein biogenesis inhibitors (zotatifin, ternatin-4, and PS3061; Fig. 6b, Extended Data Fig. 9) and ligands of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors: haloperidol, PB28, PD-144418 and hydroxychloroquine, which is undergoing clinical trials in COVID-19 patients; we also subsequently found the SigmaR1/R2 active drugs clemastine, cloperastine, and progesterone (Fig. 6c, Extended Data Fig. 9) and the clinical molecule siramesine (Extended Data Figure 9) to be antiviral.
TCID50 assays on supernatants from infected cells treated with PB28 (IC90 0.278 μM) and zotatifin (IC90 0.037 μM) revealed a more potent inhibition than was observed in the NP-staining assay (Fig. 6d).
A critical question going forward is whether these or related inhibitors of viral protein biogenesis will show therapeutic benefit in COVID-19 patients.
Plitidepsin is currently under consideration by the Spanish Medicines Agency for a Phase II trial in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
By the same standard, we find that the widely used antitussive dextromethorphan harbors proviral activity and therefore its use should merit caution and further study in the context of COVID-19.
Therefore, this area of pharmacology has great promise for repurposing and for the optimization of new agents in the fight against COVID-19.
To identify drugs and reagents that modulate the 332 host factors interacting with SARS-CoV-2-HEK293T/17 (MiST >= 0.70), we used two approaches: 1) a chemoinformatic analysis of open-source chemical databases and 2) a target- and pathway-specific literature search, drawing on specialist knowledge within our group.
Chemoinformatically, we retrieved 2,472 molecules from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (2020–3-12) (Supplementary Table 7) that interacted with 30 human “prey” proteins (38 approved, 71 in clinical trials), and found 10,883 molecules (95 approved, 369 in clinical trials) from the ChEMBL25 database (Supplementary Table 8).
For both approaches, molecules were prioritized on their FDA approval status, activity at the target of interest better than 1 μM, and commercial availability, drawing on the ZINC database.

The analysis is based on 2,784 sequences obtained from GISAID on April 4, 2020.
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 2.3 million people, killed over 160,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption 1 , 2 .
Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.
