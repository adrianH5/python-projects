Current report conducted careful examination of the sequences of 2019-nCoV, other CoV viruses and HIV-1 as well as GenBank database.
Blast against viral sequence database also showed these insertion sequences widely exist in all kinds of viruses from bacteriophage, influenza, to giant eukaryotic viruses (Table 1).
More hits were found for coronaviruses and a few also hit on HIV-1 sequences than the search against the entire database (Table 1).
