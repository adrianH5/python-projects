The main phase and that is more pathologically relevant to COVID‐19 is, however, the delayed pneumonia which itself could vary depending on the disease severity level (Li et al., 2020).
Inhibiting TMPRSS2 could exert a dual effect on COVID‐19, that of limiting viral entry by reducing the cleavage of the spike protein in ACE2 receptor mediated viral entry as shown by Hoffmann et al. (2020) and that of inhibiting NF‐kB pathway leading to a weaker pro‐inflammatory response with less severe lung pathology as shown by Iwata‐Yoshikawa et al. (2019) on SARS and MERS‐CoV, with celastrol likely mediating both mechanisms.
Even though application of antiinflammatory agents in COVID‐19 may be debatable or one should say highly dependent on the disease stage, a trial of compounds like celastrol with promising effect in a variety of related lung diseases is highly encouraged.
