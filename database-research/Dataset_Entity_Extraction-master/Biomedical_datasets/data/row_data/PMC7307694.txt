From March 23 to May 31, 2020, Addgene received about 5,300 COVID-19 plasmid requests (Fig. 1A) from âˆ¼50 countries (Fig. 1B).
Of these, 94 plasmid requests (from 27 countries) are for CRISPR plasmids that are part of the COVID-19 collection.
As with the widespread sharing of CRISPR tools in previous years, it's likely that as labs reopen, many will adopt these tools to study coronaviruses and build new diagnostic tools using the reagents from Addgene's COVID-19 collection.
