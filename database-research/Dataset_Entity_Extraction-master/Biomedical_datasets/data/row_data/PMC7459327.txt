Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 and has been declared a pandemic [1].
Clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely, ranging from asymptomatic to mild or severe forms [2,3].
Although epitopes mapping within all SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins have been shown to elicit NtAb, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein (S) is immunodominant and a highly specific target of most potent NtAbs in COVID-19 patients [[6], [7], [8], [9]].
The involvement of functional antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 clearance and modulation of COVID-19 severity remains to be precisely defined [10].
Moreover, passive immunization of critically ill COVID-19 patients with plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconverted was associated with improved clinical outcomes in uncontrolled case series [13,14].
In this context, higher antibody titers, either neutralizing or not, have been reported to be present in patients developing severe forms of COVID-19 when compared to mildly symptomatic individuals who did not require hospitalization [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]].
All patients presented with pneumonia and imaging/laboratory findings compatible with COVID-19 [2,3].
We considered high NtAb50 titers those ≥1/160, as this is the minimum NtAb titer of plasma from COVID-19 convalescent individuals recommended by the FDA for therapeutic use [30].
As expected, ICU patients were hospitalized for longer periods and the median serum levels of several pro-inflammatory biomarkers, (LDH, dimer-D and IL-6) were significantly higher in ICU patients, further confirming their association with COVID-19 severity [[2], [3], [4], [5]].
Avidity of SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in sera from COVID-19 patients was assessed by a conventional urea dissociation assay [26].
Very weak (Rho=>0.0–<0.2) or weak (Rho=>0.2–<0.4) correlations (either positive or negative) were found between SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels or NtAb50 titers and all selected biomarkers when considering the entire data set (Fig. 6
) or when analyses were done separately for specimens collected at different time frames after the onset of symptoms (days 1–15 or days 15–30; not shown).
Here, in addition to further characterizing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we mainly aimed to determine whether a relationship could be established between the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and NtAb levels and the “inflammatory state” of patients, which has been shown to directly correlate with COVID-19 severity and prognosis [[2], [3], [4], [5]].
Previous studies have reported a correlation between RBD IgG levels and NtAb titers in patients with comparable or less severe clinical presentations of COVID-19, using either live native SARS-CoV-2 virus, engineered SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus systems or replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses [18,22,[30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]].
The alleged association between high SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and COVID-19 severity [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]] is a matter of concern.
Wang et al. [18] also reported higher NtAb50 titers quantitated by a pseudotyped-virus based neutralization assay in severely ill patients as compared to mild COVID-19 patients.
Other studies including relatively small cohorts also pointed to an association of COVID-19 severity with SARS-CoV-2 NtAb [20,22,38].
Disregulated synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is thought to be a pathogenetic hallmark of most severe forms of COVID-19 [4,5].
Although the mechanisms of COVID-19–induced lung injury remain unclear, the so-called “cytokine storm” may likely play a critical role in the process of disease worsening and thus in COVID-19 prognosis [40].
Taken together, these data argue against a robust relationship between the magnitude of the antibody responses subjected to analysis herein and the state of inflammation in COVID-19 patients.
•  NtAb and RBD IgGs levels do not associate with COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.
The involvement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in mediating immunopathogenetic events in COVID-19 patients has been suggested.
By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity.
The data presented herein do not support an association between SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG or NtAb50 levels and COVID-19 severity.
