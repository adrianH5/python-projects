They were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans until the last two decades, which have seen three outbreaks of highly transmissible and pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes the disease COVID-19).
In the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, extensive worldwide research efforts have focused on identifying coronavirus genetic variation and selection [6–8], in order to understand the emergence of host/tissue specificities and to help develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies.
Viral genome sequences were downloaded from the Genbank database, as shown in Table 1.
We set the threshold for prediction of a functional ORF to be XME ≥ 5 (i.e. XME score in the reading frame ≥5), based on our benchmark studies (data not shown) of experimentally validated ORFs in a large set of 80 genomes [15] covering a wide range of viruses (including single-stranded and double-stranded DNA viruses and single-stranded and double-stranded RNA viruses).
To avoid any statistical bias, coronavirus genome sequences were excluded from the benchmark.
This ORF is not annotated in the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (MT072688), but is annotated as ORF3b in the genome of another SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the first U.S. case of COVID-19 (MN985325).
The datasets analysed during the current study are available in the Genbank viral genomes database, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/
