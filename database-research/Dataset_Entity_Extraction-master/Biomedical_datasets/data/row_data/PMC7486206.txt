Coronavirus disease−19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) which originated in the Wuhan city of China, spreading across 215 countries and affecting more than 7.2 million people worldwide, and cases are still increasing further (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
The diagnosis of coronavirus disease−19 (COVID-19) relies on the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) RNA by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in respiratory samples.
Rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases across the world requires fast and efficient testing as testing capacity is a bottleneck in diagnosis.
Highlights     •  Utility of pooling samples in COVID-19 testing to save time, cost, and manpower.
