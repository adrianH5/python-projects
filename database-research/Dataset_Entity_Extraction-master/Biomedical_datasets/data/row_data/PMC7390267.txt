The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a dramatic impact on the health of millions of people and became a challenge for the worldwide health systems [1, 2].
In this work we explored the landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulation mediated by miRNAs and isomiRs in different human organs using bioinformatic analysis of publicly available paired miRNA/mRNA-sequencing datasets.
The latter included hsa-miR-125a-5p (targeting ACE2 in esophagus, kidney and lung), as well as hsa-miR-199a-5p (regulating expression of TMPRSS2 in liver, stomach and uterine corpus, see Fig 3).
In order to determine the other players involved in the interplay between hsa-let-7e-5p / hsa-miR-125a-5p and ACE2 / TMPRSS2 genes we searched for proteins regulating the transcription of those miRNAs using literature-curated interaction databases.
Thus, lysine-specific demethylase 5B (JARID1B, encoded by the KDM5B gene) had been previously shown to repress the transcription of hsa-let-7e / hsa-mir-125a miRNAs and miR-200 family (including miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c and miR-429) by promoting H3K4me3 histone mark demethylation within the regulatory regions of miRNAs, thereby facilitating epigenetic repression of their transcription.
As a result, JARID1B epigenetic activity can indirectly regulate expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
To explore putative interactions between JARID1B and ACE2 / TMPRSS2 genes more deeply we analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data obtained from certain human organs (annotated and deposited by Sungnak et al. [26]).
Specifically, the mean dropout rate (i.e. the ratio of the number of cells with no JARID1B, ACE2 or TMPRSS2 aligned reads to the total number of cells) across all cell types was 87.9% for KDM5B, 99.1% for ACE2 and 93.2% for TMPRSS2.
To overcome the issue caused by high dropout rates we calculated the mean expression of each gene for all cell types from the explored datasets (see S3 Table).
Using the literature-curated interaction database we have found strong indications that the JARID1B gene can repress let-7e / miR-125a as well as miR-200 families presumably via epigenetic mechanisms.
Thus, Mitra et al. [31] have previously provided experimental evidence that the JARID1B gene represses transcription of the let-7e and miR-125a by promoting H3K4me3 demethylation.
Specifically, shRNA-mediated knockdown of JARID1B in MCF-7 and T47D cells led to a several-fold increase in expression of both miRNAs, while simultaneous ChIP analysis confirmed the H3K4 demethylation of the corresponding regulatory DNA sequences.
In another report, Enkhbaatar et al. [32] showed that JARID1B represses transcription of miR-200 family by a similar mechanism.
Specifically, the overexpression of JARID1B in lung cancer cell line A549 resulted in 3-fold decrease of miR-200a and miR-200c expression while JARID1B knockdown led to 1.5-fold increase of their steady-state levels.
Therefore, our results go in accordance with the experimental data showing the existence of regulatory network involving let-7e / miR-125a / miR-200 families, histone demethylase JARID1B as well as ACE2 / TMPRSS2, and further suggest a new way for regulating ACE2 expression.
Furthermore, our single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis strongly supports the existence of such interactions in other cells, and indicates that in the majority of human cells ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not expressed without JARID1B.
In particular, high expression levels of JARID1B, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human respiratory epithelium cells intimate that further investigation of the identified regulatory network could expand our understanding of the viral infection pathogenesis.
The potential interactions between ACE2 and histone modifiers such as HAT1, HDAC2, and JARID1B in the lung has been previously shown by Pinto and co-authors [33].
Furthermore, Gordon D. et al. suggested the inhibition of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to be used as a promising strategy for COVID-19 therapy [34].
Interestingly, Valproic acid was also shown to directly inhibit JARID1B in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) [35] and H9 human embryonic stem cells (H9 hESC) [36].
The data included samples from several tissues: 19 for bladder (TCGA-BLCA), 104 for breast (TCGA-BRCA), 8 for colon (TCGA-COAD), 11 for esophagus (TCGA-ESCA), 127 for kidney (TCGA-KICH, TCGA-KIRC, TCGA-KIRP), 50 for liver (TCGA-LIHC), 58 for lung (TCGA-LUAD, TCGA-LUSC), 52 for prostate (TCGA-PRAD), 32 for stomach (TCGA-STAD), 58 for thyroid (TCGA-THCA) and 22 for uterine corpus (TCGA-UCEC).
TransmiR v2.0 [47] literature-curated database was used to extract information on protein-miRNA regulatory interactions.
Development of novel approaches for regulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is becoming increasingly important within the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic since these enzymes play a crucial role in cell infection.
In particular, we found that lysine-specific demethylase 5B (JARID1B), encoded by the KDM5B gene, can indirectly affect ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression by repressing transcription of hsa-let-7e / hsa-mir-125a and hsa-mir-141 / hsa-miR-200 miRNA families which are targeting these genes.
