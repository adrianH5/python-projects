On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially renamed 2019-nCoV, which is responsible for the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Notably, the current COVID-19 outbreak is characterized by its significant dispersal into many major urban centers in China and beyond, further facilitating its continued spread from person to person (Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a), and has caused considerable morbidity and mortality in China and elsewhere.
Although the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has excessed 12 million, it showed that countries had only discovered on average about 6 % of coronavirus infections and the true number of infected people worldwide may already have reached several tens of millions(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-covid-average-actual-infections-worldwide.html).
These factors will contribute the subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks, and many scientists believe that COVID-19 outbreaks will be recurrence.
Therefore, identifying the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still a top research priority for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak.
Since the first whole-genome sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank accession number MN908947, also named hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 with accession ID EPI_ISL_402125 in GISAID) of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which was isolated from a 41-year old man who worked at Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, was shared online on 11 January, 2020, that first genome became the baseline for researchers to track the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it spreads around the world (Wu et al., 2020b).
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak and the identification of the pandemic virus, laboratories around the world are generating viral genome sequence data with unprecedented speed, researchers have sequenced and shared some 66 000 viral genomes from around the world on 14 July, 2020.
Such a vast amount of available genetic data presents a unique opportunity for researchers to trace the origin and spread of COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries and gain real-time insights into the pandemic, enabling real-time progress in the understanding of the new disease and in the research and development of candidate medical countermeasures.
As of 19 February 2020, more than 100 genomes of human-obtained SARS-CoV-2 strains have been released on GISAID (http://gisaid.org/) (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017).
The dataset used in present study was also not randomized.
The final dataset (“dataset_112”) included 112 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Australia (n = 8), Belgium (n = 1), China (n = 53), Finland (n = 1), France (n = 10), Germany (n = 1), Japan (n = 7), Korea (n = 1), Nepal (n = 1), Singapore (n = 11), Thailand (n = 2), UK (n = 2), and USA (n = 14) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020.
We first aligned the collected dataset (“dataset_112”) using MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and subsequently edited the alignment manually using BioEdit v7.2.5 (Hall, 1999).
To assess recombination of our dataset (“dataset_112”), we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) to measure similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1 (Huson and Bryant, 2006) and the default recombination detection methods using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) v4.100 (Martin et al., 2015).
The best-fit nucleotide substitution model for “dataset_112” was identified according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) method with three (24 candidate models) or 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.10 (Darriba et al., 2012).
To evaluate the phylogenetic signals of “dataset_112”, we performed likelihood-mapping analysis (Schmidt and von Haeseler, 2007) using TREE-PUZZLE v5.3 (Schmidt et al., 2002), with 280 000 randomly chosen quartets for the dataset.
Split network analysis was performed for “dataset_112” using Kishino-Yano-85 (Kimura, 1980) distance transformation with the NeighborNet method, which can be loosely thought of as a “hybrid” between the neighbor-joining (NJ) and split decomposition methods, implemented in TREE-PUZZLE v5.3 (Schmidt et al., 2002).
Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for the dataset were estimated using PhyML v3.1 (Guindon et al., 2010) under a Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) (Kimura, 1980) nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariable sites, which was identified as the best fitting model for ML inference by jModelTest v2.1.10 (Darriba et al., 2012).
Analysis of temporal molecular evolutionary signals for the dataset was conducted using TempEst v1.5 (Rambaut et al., 2016).
We also estimated the evolutionary rate and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for “dataset_112” using ML dating in the TreeTime package (Sagulenko et al., 2018).
To estimate the Bayesian molecular clock phylogenies of SARS-CoV-2, Bayesian inference analyses were performed for “dataset_112” through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Yang and Rannala, 1997) framework implemented in BEAST v1.8.4 (Drummond et al., 2012), with the BEAGLE v2.1.2 library program (Suchard and Rambaut, 2009) used for computational enhancement.
For model selection, we tested five coalescent tree priors for our dataset: a constant-size population (Kingman, 1982), an exponential growth population with growth rate parameterization (Griffiths and Tavare, 1994), another exponential growth population with doubling time parameterization (Griffiths and Tavare, 1994), a Bayesian skyline tree prior (five groups, piecewise-constant model) (Drummond et al., 2005), and a Bayesian Skygrid tree prior (five population sizes across our 0.2 year interval, allowing a different population size to be estimated for 14.6 days (d)) (Gill et al., 2013).
For “dataset_112”, a HKY (Kimura, 1980) nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariable sites was the model of best fit across the two different substitution schemes (i.e., 24 and 88 candidate models) according to the BIC method, and was thus used in subsequent likelihood-mapping and phylogenetic analyses.
The PHI test of “dataset_112” did not find statistically significant evidence of recombination (p = 1.0).
Our likelihood-mapping analysis revealed that the quartets from “dataset_112” were primarily distributed in the center (63.2 %) rather than the corners (36.8 %) or sides (0%) of the triangle, indicating a strong star-like topology signal, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread (Fig. 1
A), in accordance with previous studies (Li et al., 2020b; Li et al., 2020c; Li et al., 2020d).
The split network generated for “dataset_112” using the NeighborNet method revealed the existence of polytomies, and thus was highly unresolved.
This indicated that the phylogenetic relationship of our dataset was probably best represented by a star-like phylogenetic tree rather than a strictly bifurcating tree (Fig. 1B), suggesting possible rapid early spread of SARS-CoV-2, in accordance with the likelihood-mapping results.
ML phylogenetic analysis of “dataset_112” also showed star-like topology (Fig. 2
), indicating the introduction of a new virus to an immunologically naive population, in accordance with the likelihood-mapping and split network results.
Root-to-tip linear regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best-fitting root, which minimizes the mean of the squares of the residuals, showed that “dataset_112” had a minor positive temporal signal (R = 0.087; correlation coefficient = 0.2945), thus suggesting a minor clocklike pattern of molecular evolution (Fig. 3
).
The ML dating analyses between root-to-tip genetic divergence and sampling date also showed that our dataset had a minor strong positive temporal signal (R = 0.09) (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The evolutionary rate and TMRCA date estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” were 5.35 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year and 19 October 2019, respectively, in accordance with the root-to-tip regression results using TempEst v1.5 (Rambaut et al., 2016).
Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” ranged from 12 November 2019 to 7 December 2019 (95 % BCI: 11 October 2019 and 21 December 2019) and from 8.37 × 10−4 to 1.12 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year (95 % BCI: 5.06 × 10−4–1.53 × 10−3), respectively (Table 1
).
The best-fitting combination was an UCLN relaxed molecular clock along with an exponential growth tree prior model with growth rate parameterization, as shown by the marginal likelihood estimates for “dataset_112” when comparing the two clock models and five tree prior models.
Thus, the TMRCA date and evolutionary rate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” with the best-fitting combination were 12 November 2019 (95 % BCI: 11 October 2019 and 09 December 2019) and 9.90 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year (95 % BCI: 6.29 × 10−4–1.35 × 10−3), respectively (Table 1).
The estimates of the MCC phylogenetic relationships among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes for our dataset from the Bayesian coalescent framework using the tip-dating method, as well as the exponential coalescent tree prior with doubling time parameterization and UCLN relaxed molecular clock, are displayed in Fig. 4
.
As shown, “dataset_112” exhibited more genetic diversity than our previous datasets (Li et al., 2020b; Li et al.
Analysis showed that the R estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” experienced complex phylodynamics characterized by at least two growing and two declining phases (Fig. 5
).
The mean R estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for our dataset ranged from 0.336 to 4.137, and the first growth phase had more uncertainty compared to the remaining phases due to the wider 95 % highest posterior density (HPD) interval of R estimates.
Notably, we found very low R estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112″ during the recent sampling time period.
To investigate the global epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we performed comprehensive evolutionary analyses of 112 genomes from “dataset_112”.
Split network analysis of SARS-CoV-2 based on “dataset_112” using the NeighborNet method was more resolved over time as more genome sequences were added to our study compared with our previous results (Li et al., 2020d).
These results are also consistent with our ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed a more bifurcating tree topology from “dataset_112” compared to our previous results (Li et al., 2020c; Li et al., 2020d; Li et al., 2020e), (Fig. 2).
Our dataset still had a minor positive temporal signal based on regression analysis using TempEst v1.5 (Rambaut et al., 2016) and ML dating analysis using TreeTime package (Sagulenko et al., 2018) compared to our previous results (Li et al., 2020d).
Furthermore, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” were found to be nearly identical using both analyses (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1), consistent with earlier results (Li et al., 2020d).
The estimated TMRCA dates of SARS-CoV-2 based on “dataset_112” using TempEst v1.5 (Rambaut et al., 2016) (19 October 2019) and ML dating analysis using TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018) (19 October 2019) were also identical to our previous results (Li et al., 2020d).
However, the estimated evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” using TempEst v1.5 (Rambaut et al., 2016) (5.3504 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year) and ML dating analysis using TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018) (5.35 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year) were very distinct to our prior results (Li et al., 2020d) using TempEst v1.5 (Rambaut et al., 2016) (3.3452 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year) and ML dating analysis using TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018) (3.34 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year).
The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” were very similar across different clocks using the tip-dating method, but very distinct across different coalescent tree priors (e.g., parametric coalescent and nonparametric coalescent models) (Table 1).
In summary, the TMRCA date and evolutionary rate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” are still sensitive to the tree prior, and additional genomes should make these estimates more robust towards the tree prior choice.
We employed the BDSKY model (Stadler et al., 2013) and found that the R estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for “dataset_112” experienced a complex phylodynamic history (Fig. 5).
For the epidemiological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from “dataset_112”, the non-random and non-well-mixing of the sampled population, and the non-constant sampling effort may be potential strong sources of bias in the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic parameters, which is an issue for all molecular evolutionary studies using real world data.
It is important to note that there is currently not enough genomic data from the early COVID-19 outbreak period to interpret the early history of global transmissions of COVID-19 from few genomes in detail.
The 95 % BCI estimates for the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates are averaged over many plausible phylogenetic reconstructions of the genome data; thus, as more patients with COVID-19 are sampled and more SARS-CoV-2 genomes become available, we expect these estimates will become narrower.
To investigate the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the current COVID-19 outbreak, a total of 112 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains sampled from China and 12 other countries with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020 were analyzed.
