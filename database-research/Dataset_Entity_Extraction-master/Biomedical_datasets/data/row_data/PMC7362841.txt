The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention identified this infection as a novel coronavirus infection on Jan 7, 2020 and on Feb 11, 2020, the WHO announced a new name for the pandemic disease as 2019-new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Studies from Europe, China, and USA on COVID‐19 have consistently shown that older age and comorbidity are major risk factors for adverse outcomes and mortality.
Although most reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81 %), approximately 80 % of deaths had occurred among adults population older than 60 years of age; only one (0.1 %) death had occurred in a person under 19 years of age [[3], [4], [5]].
Data from the UK [10] of more than 400 pregnant patients hospitalised with COVID-19 suggest an increased potential for adverse maternal outcomes in pregnant patients hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19 infection; while the risk of an intrauterine vertical transmission is inconclusive.
Royal college of Obstetrics and Gynaecology recommends that delivery in COVID-19 patients should be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies [11].
Our study aims to provide additional emerging information for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19.
RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was used to determine COVID-19 in suspected infection from both maternal and neonatal nasopharyngeal samples.
A total of 6779 pregnant patients attended our Maternity unscheduled triaging system (Fig. 1
), of which 79 had suspected COVID-19 symptoms for which nasopharyngeal samples for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were taken.
23/79 (29 %) of patients had confirmed COVID-19 infection based on the RT-PCT test.
For all the 23 patients, chest radiography also showed scattered multiple patchy infiltrates alongside ground glass appearances in both lungs consistent with COVID-19.
In our cohort of 23 women, we had 19 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in their 3rd trimester delivering 20 neonates (18 singleton, and 1 set of twins), and 4 women with confirmed COVID-19 in their second trimester.
One new-born, who was delivered at 35 weeks by emergency C-section to black African patient due to severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms requiring ventilation, had low Apgar score of 3 and 5, at 1 and 5 min respectively following delivery (Table 1).
Recently, Chen et al. [5], and Zhu et al. [17] reported that the perinatal infection COVID-19 may have adverse effects on new-borns, but compared with SARS-CoV, the adverse mother-to-child outcomes are fewer.
One pregnancy with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the third trimester had a neonate with intrauterine growth restriction.
To study the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
We prospectively collected and analysed data for a cohort of 23 pregnant patients including singleton and multiple pregnancies tested positive for COVID-19 between February 2020 and April 2020 inclusive to assess the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes.
Twenty-three pregnant patients tested positive for COVID-19, delivering 20 babies including a set of twins, with four ongoing pregnancies at the time of manuscript submission.
Four out of total 23 COVID-19 pregnant patients (17.4 %) developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome complications requiring ICU support, one of whom led to maternal death 1/23 (4.3 %).
Conclusion  COVID-19 is associated with high prevalence of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and caesarean section compared to non−COVID pregnancies.
COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications.
