Searching against UniProt database (UniProt Consortium) [65] resulted in matches for the polyprotein (wORF1ab), all four structural proteins (wS, wE, wM, and wN), and six ORFs (wORF3a, wORF6, wORF7a, wORF7b, wORF8, and wORF10), also referred to as the accessory proteins.
Our search resulted in three new homologs of ORF8 not reported in UniProt that were originated from three different isolates of bat SARS-like coronavirus: bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank ID: MG772933, collected in 2017), bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank ID: MG772934, collected in 2015), and RaTG13 (GenBank ID: MN996532, collected in 2013).
To expedite the advancement of our knowledge, we leveraged data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases and integrated these data into a single computational pipeline.
