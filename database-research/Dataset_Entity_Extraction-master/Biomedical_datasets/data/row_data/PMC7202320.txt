In addition, a combined approach using both HbA1c and FPG measurement was evaluated in the Pregnancy and Infant Development (PRIDE) Study cohort (4303 women): HbA1c levels ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) and/or FPG levels ≥ 92 mg/dL had a detection rate of 51% for HIP, as defined by UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria, and a 12% rate of false-positive cases.
However, in the absence of additional evidence, we recommend that this guidance be followed only for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a return back to the usual French recommended screening procedure when it appears to be safe and feasible to do so.
