We firstly collected the representative SARS-COV-2 genome (MN908947, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) and the mutation information of the SARS-COV-2 genomes from the 2019nCoVR database (Zhao et al.2020), which is available at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/.
The 2019nCoVR database not only integrates genomic and proteomic sequences of SARS-COV-2 from different resources, but also provides a series of scientific services, such as variation visualization, variation annotations, AI diagnosis, etc.
In addition, we also analyzed the mutations of the target sequences by comparing all the 143 high quality strains in the 2019nCoVR database (as of March 15, 2020).
