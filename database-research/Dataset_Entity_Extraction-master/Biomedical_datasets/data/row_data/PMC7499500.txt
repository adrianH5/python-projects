Abstract   Background  Waning immunity occurs in patients who have recovered from COVID-19.
Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens collected during two episodes of COVID-19 in a patient.
Compared to viral genomes in GISAID, the first virus genome has a stop codon at position 64 of orf8 leading to a truncation of 58 amino acids, and was phylogenetically closely related to strains collected in March/April 2020, while the second virus genome was closely related to strains collected in July/August 2020.
