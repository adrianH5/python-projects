The virus causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue., Early data indicated that about 20% of patients develop severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, including 5% who are admitted to the intensive care unit.
The mortality from COVID-19 is higher in people older than 65 years and in people with underlying comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes.–
Therefore, systematic tracking of demographic and clinical patient information, as well as strain information is indispensable to effectively combat COVID-19.
In total, we downloaded 15 755 genome sequences from the following databases: the Chinese National Microbiology Data Center on 1 February 2020; the Chinese National Genomics Data Center Genome Warehouse on 4 February 2020; GISAID on 1 May 2020 and GenBank on 1 May 2020.
Methods  Between 1 February and 1 May 2020, we downloaded 10 022 SARS CoV-2 genomes from four databases.
