The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) as public health emergency of international concern and put in place a series of temporary recommendations on January 30.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 has nearly 3 million confirmed cases worldwide with more than 200,000 deaths, as of April 27, 2020, according to the WHO.
Many researches are now underway to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing the COVID-19 pandemic, including therapeutic drugs such as inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the viral protease, and blockers of virus-cell membrane fusion as well as vaccines, and large scale clinical trials have just begun [6, 7].
Full-length viral nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (accession number MN908947 and MN996527-MN996531) [1, 2], SARS-CoV (accession number AY274119, AY278488 and AY390556), bat-derived SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoV) RaTG13 (accession number MN996532), and MERS-CoV (accession number JX869059) were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank.
Epitope prediction was carried out using the predicted proteins, including S, E, N, M, and ORFs (corresponding to accession numbers QHD43415-QHD43423, QHI42199) of the reference SARS-CoV-2_Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession number MN908947).
We first aligned each of these SARS-CoV-2 sequences to the reference sequence SARS-CoV-2_Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession number MN908947) using BLAT software [14].
After the alignment, we extracted nucleotide sequences corresponding to individual proteins of SARS-CoV-2, translated them to amino acid sequences, and then compared them to reference amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2_Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession numbers QHD43415-QHD43423, QHI42199).
Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2_WIV02 (accession number MN996527), SARS-CoV_GZ02 (AY390556), and Bat-CoV_RaTG13 (MN996532) were compared with SARS-CoV-2_Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947)
156 amino acid mutations, which were observed at more than 0.5% frequencies in at least one region, were plotted
To control the current COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the second pandemic in the near future, the development of new drugs and vaccines, and the establishment of tools investigating the immune responses in patients or silently-infected individuals are urgent issues.
In addition, several reports have suggested that a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine release syndrome [19, 20].
These HLA-oligomers might be useful to predict and monitor acute T-cell responses in COVID-19 patients who cause these life-threatning symptoms.
To control and prevent the current COVID-19 pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue.
