On 26 January 2020, the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case was reported in Arizona (third case in the United States) (1).
In anticipation of COVID-19 spreading in Arizona, we initiated a surveillance effort for the local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 starting 24 January 2020.
Given the estimated 1- to 14-day incubation period for COVID-19, the spike in cases might be related to university spring break holiday travel (8 to 15 March), as previously seen in other outbreaks (4, 5).
This generated an NGS data set of 20.7 to 22.7 million paired-end reads per sample.
GenBank and GISAID accession numbers were the following: SARS-CoV-2 AZ-ASU2922, MT339039 and EPI_ISL_424668; SARS-CoV-2 AZ-ASU2923, MT339040 and EPI_ISL_424669; SARS-CoV-2 AZ-ASU2936, MT339041 and EPI_ISL_424671; SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan1, MN908947.3; Pangolin, EPI_ISL_410721; Bat-RaTG13, MN996532.1; and SARS-CoV, AY278741.1.
The 81-nt (27-amino-acid) deletion observed in SARS-CoV-2 AZ_ASU2923 ORF7a was not present in the 6,290 SARS-CoV-2 sequences available from GISAID as of 12 April 2020.
