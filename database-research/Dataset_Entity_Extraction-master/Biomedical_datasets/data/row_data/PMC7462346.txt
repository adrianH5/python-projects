Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and first reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1].
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include acute pneumonia detected via computed tomography imaging or radiological examination.
Although the medical diagnosis of COVID-19 is rapid and efficient, effective treatments do not yet exist [6].
In China, clinical trials are being conducted with patients at Wuhan hospitals to determine whether high doses of VC can manage COVID-19 [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04264533].
Thus, combining VC with existing medicines or bioactive compounds may enhance the former’s therapeutic effectiveness against COVID-19 while minimizing side effects.
Based on the potent pharmacological properties of both VC and GA, their combined use may effectively manage COVID-19.
At this time, no empirical data supports the clinical efficacy of VC + GA treatment against COVID-19 has not been investigated.
However, we can perform bioinformatics analysis as a theoretical evaluation of potential anti-COVID-19 molecular mechanisms of VC + GA to support future clinical trials.
GA treatment against the novel coronavirus, thereby uncovering anti-COVID-19 processes and mechanisms in detail (Figure 1).
Potential targets were acquired after a thorough analysis of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) [23], Drugbank [24], SuperPred, Swiss Target Prediction [25], ChemMapper [26], Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular mechANism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BATMAN TCM) [27] and SuperPred webserver [28] datasets.
Functional targets of VC and GA in humans were selected from the Swiss-Prot and Uniprot databases [29].
Genecard [30] and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [31] databases were used to screen SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic targets.
Custom Venn diagrams (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) were created to show correlative targets of VC and GA against COVID-19.
Cytoscape version 3.7.1 was used to construct visualizations of the component-target-pathway network, GO biological processes and KEGG pathways of VC and GA’s individual and combined effects against COVID-19 [34].
We performed pairwise comparisons on bioinformational data of the top 20 biological processes and KEGG-enriched pathways involved in the separate therapeutic effects of VC and GA against COVID-19.
We used common targets of VC and GA against SARS-CoV-19 as inputs to a STRING database (version 11.0) [36], creating target-to-target network interactions and a target interaction PPI network diagram.
We screened Genecard and OMIM datasets to identify 426 COVID-19-associated genes.
Venn diagrams revealed 34 VC-intersection (Figure 2A) and 28 GA-intersection (Figure 2B) targets against COVID-19.
The results of GO analysis suggested that the biological processes of core VC targets against COVID-19 were mainly involved in peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine modification, regulation of cell–cell adhesion, cellular response to biotic stimulus, positive regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, regulation of leukocyte cell–cell adhesion, regulation of T cell activation, response to lipopolysaccharide, T cell activation, blood coagulation, leukocyte cell–cell adhesion, cellular response to external stimulus, hemostasis, coagulation, response to molecule of bacterial origin, platelet activation, fatty acid metabolic process, positive regulation of cell adhesion, regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport and positive regulation of protein transport (Figure 3A and B and Supplementary Table 1, see Supplementary Data available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib).
The GO data indicated that functional processes of core GA targets against COVID-19 were associated with response to lipopolysaccharide, cellular response to abiotic stimulus, cellular response to environmental stimulus, response to molecule of bacterial origin, placenta development, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, reproductive structure development, reproductive system development, peptidyl-serine modification, lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, cellular response to external stimulus, platelet activation, regulation of cell–cell adhesion, cellular response to mechanical stimulus, positive regulation of establishment of protein localization, peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation, T cell activation, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, interaction with host and response to mechanical stimulus (Figure 4A and B and Supplementary Table 3, see Supplementary Data available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib).
We then used the ‘pathview’ package in R to generate network diagrams that highlighted core targets of enriched KEGG pathways for VC against COVID-19 (Supplementary Figure 1, see Supplementary Data available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib) and GA against COVID-19 (Supplementary Figure 2, see Supplementary Data available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib).
We identified 17 intersecting targets of VC and GA against COVID-19: PRKCE, SLC6A4, CYP2D6, PRKCB, MAPK1, EGFR, DPP4, MAPK3, ABCB1, ATP1A1, MAPK14, LCK, CCR5, PTGS2, PTGS1, PRKCA and PTPRC (Figure 5).
The top 10 GO terms of VC + GA against COVID-19 were cellular response to external stimulus (0071496), peptidyl-serine modification (0018209), peptidyl-serine phosphorylation (0018105), platelet activation (0030168), regulation of cell–cell adhesion (0022407), response to lipopolysaccharide (0032496), response to molecule of bacterial origin (0002237), T cell activation (0042110), blood coagulation (0007596) and leukocyte cell–cell adhesion (0007159) (Table 1).
GA against COVID-19 were AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications (hsa04933), Aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption (hsa04960), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance (hsa04960), ErbB signaling pathway (hsa04012), Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis (hsa04666), Glioma (hsa05214), GnRH signaling pathway (hsa04912), Human cytomegalovirus infection (hsa04912), Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection (hsa04912), MicroRNAs in cancer (hsa05206), Non-small cell lung cancer (hsa05206), Proteoglycans in cancer (hsa05205), Serotonergic synapse (hsa04726), TCR signaling pathway (hsa04660) and VEGF signaling pathway (hsa04370) (Table 2).
Respectively, Figure 6A and B shows the heatmaps depicting GO biological processes and KEGG signaling pathways of VC + GA against COVID-19, respectively.
GA-target-GO-KEGG-COVID-19 using the top 20 enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways (Figure 7).
Our result showed that VC and GA shared 10 biological processes and 15 KEGG pathways, representing their combined anti-COVID-19 targets.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, effective management and treatment strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 are in urgent demand [40].
Although VC and GA individually have potent pharmacological efficacy against viral pneumonia [41, 42], no study has investigated their combined effects or potential mechanisms against COVID-19.
Here, we used a potent strategy of network pharmacology and bioinformatics (including GO and KEGG) to uncover the integrative pharmacological mechanism of VC + GA against COVID-19.
GA may be able to suppress COVID-19 through their combined antioxidative, antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, along with immune system activation.
GA against COVID-19 involved specific modulations of immune responses, such as Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, TCR signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway and human cytomegalovirus infection.
When VC + GA activates Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and TCR, these processes may facilitate the host to initiate an immune response against COVID-19.
Our molecular functional analysis revealed that key effectors regulate the anti-COVID-19 properties just described.
GA treatment against COVID-19 is LCK, a tyrosine kinase that contributes to intracellular signaling pathways of lymphocytes.
It has been reported that COVID-19 patients with severe and fatal disease had significantly increase in white blood cell number and decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts [67, 68].
GA treatment should exert potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects through the activation of immune system, suggesting the possible use of VC + GA as optional treatment of COVID-19.
In upcoming clinical treatments for COVID-19, VC + GA supplementation may potentiate the therapeutic effectiveness of existing medicines such as Remdesivir.
However, more studies are needed to confirm the action of VC + GA on COVID-19, as we currently do not know how the supplements target and influence the virus.
We thus find VC + GA, a promising supplementary treatment against COVID-19, which is worth further investigation.
Abstract   Objective  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal and fast-spreading viral infection.
To date, the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide has crossed over six million with over three hundred and seventy thousand deaths (according to the data from World Health Organization; updated on 2 June 2020).
Although COVID-19 can be rapidly diagnosed, efficient clinical treatment of COVID-19 remains unavailable, resulting in high fatality.
We hypothesized that the combination of VC and GA is a potential option for treating COVID-19.
GA treatment for COVID-19, using bioinformational network pharmacology.
We uncovered optimal targets, biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of VC + GA against COVID-19.
Our findings suggested that combinatorial VC and GA treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including activation of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway.
For the first time, our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying combined VC and GA treatment for COVID-19.
