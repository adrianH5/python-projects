Nevertheless, 17 years later, SARS‐CoV‐2 brought a much more severe and widespread pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) to the world (Wu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020).
Up to 17 June 2020, about 6 months after the first reported case of COVID‐19, SARS‐CoV‐2 has caused 8,179,520 confirmed infections and 441,491 deaths worldwide, far surpassing the SARS pandemic.
The high transmissibility of SARS‐CoV‐2 is probably a major reason for the rapid development of COVID‐19 epidemic and more studies on the transmission of pathogenic HCoV is urgently required.
Full‐length SARS‐CoV‐2 spike (GenBank accession number MN908947.3), SARS‐CoV BJ01 spike (GenBank accession number AY278488.2) and pangolin‐CoV GD1 spike (GISAID accession number: EPI_ISL_410721) were all synthesized by Sangon and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vectors with a C‐terminal HA tag.
Typically, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS‐CoV) caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS‐CoV‐2 caused the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic.
