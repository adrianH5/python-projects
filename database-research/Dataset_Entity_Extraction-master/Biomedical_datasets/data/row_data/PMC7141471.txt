Since its emergence from Wuhan, China, in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has already claimed the lives of more than 70,000 individuals worldwide.

With the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increasing with each passing day, there is perhaps no more pressing need in medicine than to identify safe and efficacious therapies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as to attenuate the severity of the resulting COVID-19 illness.
Although there are no proven US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19, a number of promising novel (eg, remdesivir) and repurposed (eg, hydroxychloroquine, potentially together with azithromycin) pharmacological agents, reported to inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,

 are being evaluated in randomized clinical trials.
In light of (1) the need for this practice to continue in the absence of viable, evidence-based therapies and (2) the proclivity of many promising COVID-19 pharmacotherapies—specifically antimalarial agents such as hydroxychloroquine—to prolong the QTc, thereby increasing the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes (DI-TdP) and drug induced-sudden cardiac death (DI-SCD), this document was assembled to help health care professionals safely use these medications and minimize concomitant risks.

Based on this in vitro data, it has been hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine, more so than chloroquine, may have therapeutic efficacy in the COVID-19 pandemic by (1) preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2–mediated viral entry (ie, preinfection prophylaxis) and (2) attenuating the postviral cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases via a multitude of immunomodulatory mechanisms (ie, treatment of active infection/postviral sequelae).
Promising in vitro data
,
 as well as anecdotal in vivo evidence of therapeutic benefit have led many institutions, including Mayo Clinic, to consider the use of hydroxychloroquine as a first-line COVID-19 pharmacotherapy for the time being and spurred an array of clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy of repurposed hydroxychloroquine in both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
Torsadogenic Potential and Postmarketing Adverse Events Associated With Possible COVID-19 Repurposed Pharmacotherapiesa
Although some might argue that DI-SCDs in the setting of widespread chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine use represents acceptable “friendly fire” in the war on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, we believe that with the institution of a few simple and safe precautions, the risk of DI-TdP and DI-SCD can be mitigated.
Although the percentage of individuals at risk is small, given the pandemic nature of COVID-19, in absolute terms the number of individuals potentially at risk for lethal adverse drug effects is large (at least 10,000 individuals of the >1,000,000 COVID-19–positive patients worldwide are expected to be at increased risk for DI-TdP/DI-SCD if treated with these medications).
Unfortunately, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, acquisition of the patient’s QTc by the 12-lead ECG, which requires additional personnel exposure (ie, ECG technician), and a necessity for serial ECGs, which requires exposure of complex equipment (multiple ECG wires), could further strain the already limited supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) in many countries.
To this end, AliveCor, Inc, just received emergency clearance from the FDA for use of the KardiaMobile 6L device (FDA-approved for atrial fibrillation detection) for QTc monitoring of patients with COVID-19 treated with QT-prolonging medications such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (March 20, 2020, 1:15 PM CST).
For patients with COVID-19 about to be treated with medications with the increased potential for DI-TdP/DI-SCD (Figure 1), baseline QTc status should be obtained either by a traditional 12-lead ECG or perhaps preferably with the use of a smartphone-enabled mobile QTc meter using the simple infection control measures outlined in Figure 2
to limit personnel exposures and conserve critical PPE.
For patients with QTc values less than the 99th percentile for age/sex (ie, 460 ms in prepubertal males/females, 470 ms in postpubertal males, and 480 ms in postpubertal females [Figure 1 “green light” status]), the risk of DI-TdP/DI-LQTS is low, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (or other QTc-prolonging COVID-19 pharmacotherapies) should be initiated without delay as outlined in the QTc monitoring algorithm.
Remember, whether by 12-lead ECG, telemetry, or smartphone-enabled acquisition of the ECG, if the noted QT interval is less than one-half the preceding RR interval, then the calculated QTc will always be less than 460 ms and the patient can be “green light go” for COVID-19 treatments that may have QTc-prolonging potential.
For example, in younger patients with COVID-19 (ie, <40 years) who have only mild symptoms and a QTc of 500 ms or greater, it may be reasonable to avoid treatment altogether because the arrhythmia risk may outweigh the risk of developing COVID-19–related acute respiratory distress syndrome.
However, in patients with a QTc of 500 ms or greater presenting with progressively worsening respiratory symptoms or at greater risk (eg, >65 years of age, immunosuppressed, and/or high-risk comorbid conditions) for respiratory complications, the potential benefit of QTc-prolonging COVID-19 pharmacotherapies may exceed the arrhythmia risk.
Therefore, the ultimate goal of QTc surveillance in the COVID-19 pandemic should  be to identify those who cannot receive these medications but to identify those with compromised or reduced “repolarization reserve” in whom increased QTc countermeasures can and should be taken to mitigate the risk of drug-related death from DI-TdP/DI-SCD.
The timing of on-therapy QTc surveillance will be dictated not only by the pharmacokinetics of the COVID-19 therapies used but also by the practical logistics of an institution’s method of QTc monitoring.
As the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) global pandemic rages across the globe, the race to prevent and treat this deadly disease has led to the “off-label” repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, which have the potential for unwanted QT-interval prolongation and a risk of drug-induced sudden cardiac death.
With the possibility that a considerable proportion of the world’s population soon could receive COVID-19 pharmacotherapies with torsadogenic potential for therapy or postexposure prophylaxis, this document serves to help health care professionals mitigate the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias while minimizing risk of COVID-19 exposure to personnel and conserving the limited supply of personal protective equipment.
