It was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3].
In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a global pandemic with cases in more than 45 countries where the COVID-19 was spreading fast outside China, most significantly in South Korea, Italy, and Iran with over 2,924 deaths and 85,212 cases confirmed while 39,537 recovered on 29 February 2020, 06:05 AM (GMT).
COVID-19 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA).
The phylogenetic analysis indicates that COVID-19 likely originated from bats [15].
The sequence of COVID-19 RBD, together with its RBM that contacts receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was found similar to that of SARS coronavirus.
In January 2020, a group of scientists demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for COVID-19 [17–21].
However, COVID-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding motif (particularly Gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ACE2 [15].
At present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but Chinese traditional medicines, such as ShuFengJieDu capsules and Lianhuaqingwen capsules, could be possible treatments for COVID-19.
Sequences of proposed epitopes were selected from the COVID-19 reference sequence using UCSF Chimera 1.10 and saved as a PDB file.
Sequence alignment of the COVID-19 envelope protein was done using BioEdit software which shows total conservation across four sequences which were retrieved from China and the USA (Figure 3).
Applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [61–63].
The COVID-19 is an RNA virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the DNA viruses [67].
These mutations lie on the surface of the protein, which makes COVID-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in a blind spot [68].
In our present work, different peptides were proposed for designing a vaccine against COVID-19 (Figure 1).
In the beginning, the whole genome of COVID-19 was analyzed by a comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [69].
The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1) reference sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19.
New genes (ORF8 and ORF6) were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCoV-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [70].
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using ClustalW for the seven strains of coronavirus, which are COVID-19 (NC_04551), SARS-CoV (FJ211859), MESA-CoV (NC_019843), HCoV-HKU1 (AY884001), HCoV-OC43 (KF923903), HCoV-NL63 (NC_005831), and HCoV-229E (KY983587).
The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that COVID-19 is found in the same clade of SARS-CoV; thus, the two strains are highly related to each other (Figure 4).
Unfortunately, IEDB did not give any result for B-cell epitopes; this might be due to the length of the COVID-19 (75 amino acids).
Although both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19, chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently been found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 [77, 78]; nevertheless, more studies are required to standardize these therapies.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in the envelope (E) protein as candidates for COVID-19.
Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach.
Results  Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain.
The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target.
