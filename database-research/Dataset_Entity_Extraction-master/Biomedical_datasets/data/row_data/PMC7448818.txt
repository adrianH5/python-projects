Currently, multiple studies have identified a wide range of neurological deficits associated with COVID-19 [1], reflecting both immune-mediated process involving the development [2] and parenchymal injury [3].
Furthermore, a recent study by Lu and colleagues demonstrated that microstructural changes in the cerebral parenchyma can occur during the recovery phase from COVID-19 [4], indicating that the onset of CNS damage can be asynchronous with systemic manifestations and the typically salient severe respiratory disease.
