The foundation of COVID-19 diagnostic testing has included direct detection of viral genomes through nucleic acid amplification methods.
Reports of false negative results from real time PCR testing indicate that even the high analytical sensitivity of RT-PCR may be challenged by the pathology of COVID-19 [6,7].
Eluted RNA (5 μl for the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (111 specimens), 10 μl for the Taqpath COVID-19 (EUA) Multiplex assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) (5 specimens) was subjected to real time PCR either by the CDC EUA Real Time PCR for SARS-CoV-2, or the Taqpath COVID-19 Multiplex assay.
Comparison of the Taqpath COVID-19 Multiplex relative to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel showed 100 % sensitivity and specificity relative to one another, with 100 % concordance through 20 specimens.
As shown in Table 1, the Taqpath COVID-19 Multiplex assay demonstrated detection capability of 5/5 (100 %) samples at 5.5 × 10e5 copies per milliliter and at least one SARS-CoV-2 gene in 5/5 (100 %) of samples at a concentration of 5.5 × 10e4 copies per milliliter.
This ability to perform high-throughput testing, on a sensitive molecular detection platform has potential to make a significant contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic, where such high demands exist for testing.
