Objective  Management of acute severe UC (ASUC) during the novel COVID-19 pandemic presents significant dilemmas.
We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific guidance using current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines as a reference point.
We convened a RAND appropriateness panel comprising 14 gastroenterologists and an IBD nurse consultant supplemented by surgical and COVID-19 experts.
Patients with a positive swab should be discussed with COVID-19 specialists.
As per BSG guidance, intravenous hydrocortisone was considered appropriate as initial management; only in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was its use deemed uncertain.
Delaying colectomy because of COVID-19 was deemed inappropriate.
Steroid tapering as per BSG guidance was deemed appropriate for all patients apart from those with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom a 4–6 week taper was preferred.
We have suggested COVID-19-specific adaptations to the BSG ASUC guideline using a RAND panel.
