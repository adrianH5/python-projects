COVID-19 has become a planetary emergency which is seriously threatening human health [1, 2].
E sequences differ from the homologous proteins also at positions 55-56, where the dyad Ser-Phe replaces Thr-Val (except in Bat coronavirus isolate BtKY72, accession code KY352407).
The size of each Envelope variant cluster is reported in Table 1 along with accession codes and definitions of the isolates.
The size of each Membrane variant cluster is reported in Table 1 along with accession codes and definitions of the isolates.
Noteworthy, the protein from the Sars-CoV-2 NIHE isolate (accession code MT127115) possesses an Arg instead of a conserved Gly at position 89 (Figure 3).
According to the accepted theories, the current COVID-19 pandemic has been caused by the cross-species transmission of a Î²-coronavirus normally hosted by Bats and, perhaps, Pangolin to humans [3, 26].
In this paper, E and M proteins from 797 Sars-CoV-2 genomes have been compared to the counterparts taken from the most closely related virus also to evaluate the potential role of amino acid mutations in the epizootic origin of COVID-19.
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new viral infection caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
