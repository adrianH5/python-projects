Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), present with acute onset of fever, myalgia, cough, dyspnea, and radiological evidence of ground-glass lung opacities compatible with atypical pneumonia (5–7).
Therefore, clinical features and epidemiological links to Wuhan alone are not reliable for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19.
As evidenced by previous epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19 are essential for case identification, contact tracing, animal source finding, and rationalization of infection control measures (14–16).
Because of these limitations, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) remains the most useful laboratory diagnostic test for COVID-19 worldwide.
The availability of the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 early in the epidemic facilitated the development of specific primers and standardized laboratory protocols for COVID-19 (18, 19).
In this study, we developed novel, highly sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 and compared their performances with that of the established RdRp-P2 assay using both in vitro and patient specimens.
Clinical evaluation using different types of clinical specimens from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 showed that our novel assay targeting a different region of the RdRp/Hel was significantly more sensitive and specific than the RdRp-P2 assay.
SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong (22).
The viral isolate was amplified by one additional passage in VeroE6 cells to make working stocks of the virus (1.8 × 107 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/ml).
For the clinical evaluation study, a total of 273 (120 respiratory tract and 153 non-respiratory tract) clinical specimens were collected from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong whose nasopharyngeal aspirate/swabs, throat swabs, and/or sputum specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the RdRp2 assay (22).
Three novel real-time COVID-19 RT-PCR assays targeting the RdRp/Hel, S, and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
To determine the analytical sensitivity of the COVID-19 assays, we first evaluated their LODs using viral genomic RNA extracted from culture lysates and clinical specimens.
The LOD of COVID-19-RdRp/Hel, COVID-19-S, and COVID-19-N was 1.8 × 10° TCID50/ml, while the LOD of RdRp-P2 was 1 log unit higher (1.8 × 101 TCID50/ml) (Table 1).
The LOD of COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N (10−5 fold dilution) was 1 log unit lower than that of COVID-19-S and RdRp-P2 (10−4 fold dilution) (Table 1).
On the basis of these results, we then selected the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N assays for further evaluation and determined their LODs using in vitro viral RNA transcripts (Table 2).
The LODs of the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N assays using serial dilutions of in vitro viral RNA transcripts as calculated with probit analysis were 11.2 RNA copies/reaction (95% confidence interval, 7.2 to 52.6 RNA copies/reaction) and 21.3 RNA copies/reaction (95% confidence interval, 11.6 to 177.0 copies/reaction), respectively.
Test results used for the calculation of limits of detection of the COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR assays with genomic RNA for SARS-CoV-2 in culture lysates and clinical specimens
Among the 273 specimens collected from these 15 patients, 77 (28.2%) were positive by the RdRp-P2 assay (Table 3).
The novel COVID-2019-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for all of these 77 specimens.
Additionally, the COVID-2019-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for another 42 specimens (119 positive specimens of 273 total specimens [43.6%] by COVID-2019-RdRp/Hel versus 77 positive specimens of 273 total specimens [28.2%] by RdRp-P2; P < 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens that were negative by the RdRp-P2 assay.
The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was significantly more sensitive than the RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs or throat swabs (P = 0.043), saliva (P < 0.001), and plasma (P = 0.001) specimens.
As shown in Fig. 1, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in these samples with a higher sensitivity than the RdRp-2 assay throughout the patients’ course of illness up to day 12 (nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs and/or throat swabs) to day 18 (saliva).
To investigate whether the novel COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N assays cross-react with SARS-CoV, other human-pathogenic coronaviruses, and respiratory viruses, we used the assays to test 17 culture isolates of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses, influenza B virus, influenza C virus, parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 4, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus.
To investigate whether the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was specific for SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens, we used the assay to test 22 archived nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs and throat swabs that were positive for other respiratory pathogens by FilmArray RP2 from 22 patients with upper and/or lower respiratory tract symptoms.
As shown in Table 5, none of these specimens was positive by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, suggesting that the assay was specific for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs and throat swabs containing DNA/RNA of other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens.
Lack of cross-reactivity between the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay and other respiratory pathogens in clinical specimens
For COVID-19, the protocols of a number of RT-PCR assays used by different institutes have recently been made available online (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance).
Importantly, the in-use evaluation data of these assays using a large number of clinical specimens from patients with confirmed COVID-19 are lacking.
We showed that the novel COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in vitro and in COVID-19 patient specimens.
Among the three assays developed in this study, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay has the lowest LOD with in vitro viral RNA transcripts (11.2 RNA copies/reaction; 95% confidence interval; 7.2 to 52.6 RNA copies/reaction).
The LOD with genomic RNA was also very low (1.80 TCID50/ml).
Importantly, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was significantly more sensitive (P ≤ 0.001) than the established RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both respiratory tract and non-respiratory tract clinical specimens.
The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 42/273 (15.4%) additional specimens that tested negative by the RdRp-P2 assay.
These findings are clinically and epidemiologically relevant, because asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases of COVID-19 have been increasingly recognized, and these patients with cryptic pneumonia may serve as a potential source for propagating the epidemic (2, 8).
Given the large number of patients (>60,000 cases in China at the time of writing) involved in this expanding epidemic, the additional positive specimens detected by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay might translate into thousands of specimens that would otherwise be considered SARS-CoV-2 negative by the less-sensitive RdRp-P2 assay.
Regarding the different types of clinical specimens, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was significantly more sensitive than the RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs or throat swabs, saliva specimens, and plasma specimens.
False-negative results might arise from testing nasopharyngeal aspirate/swabs or throat swabs with low viral loads in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients (2, 30–33).
RT-PCR assays with higher sensitivity, such as the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, might help to reduce the false-negative rate among these specimens which are frequently the only specimens available for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19.
We have previously shown that saliva has a high concordance rate with nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of influenza viral RNA and might also be a suitable specimen for diagnosing COVID-19 (22, 34).
The use of the highly sensitive COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay to test saliva specimens from suspected cases of COVID-19 might be a simple and rapid way to avoid the need of aerosol-generating procedures during collection of nasopharyngeal aspirates and suction of sputum, especially in regions most heavily affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak where there are insufficient supplies of full personal protective equipment (13).
SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia has been reported in a small proportion of COVID-19 patients (2, 5).
However, as shown in our clinical evaluation in which the RdRp-P2 assay gave negative test results for all 10 plasma specimens that gave positive test results by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, the genuine incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia might be underestimated by less sensitive RT-PCR assays.
Thus, serial monitoring of the plasma viral load in COVID-19 patients with the highly sensitive COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay should be considered to provide prognostic insights and facilitate treatment decisions.
The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was highly specific and exhibited no cross-reactivity with other common respiratory pathogens in vitro and in nasopharyngeal aspirates.
This cross-reactivity would be especially important for laboratories in areas where SARS-CoV might reemerge and cocirculate with SARS-CoV-2, as the differences in clinical progression between SARS and COVID-19 remain incompletely understood at this stage.
Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.
Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.
Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID 50 ]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts).
Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays.
The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRp-P2-negative specimens (119/273 [43.6%] versus 77/273 [28.2%]; P < 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens.
The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture.
The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.
