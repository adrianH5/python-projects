Furthermore, a history of cigarette smoke exposure, the major risk factor for the development of COPD, has been associated with more severe disease in patients infected with a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic ().
Mice with homozygous loss of Miz1 showed up-regulation in the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative organism in the current COVID-19 pandemic ().
Reads were aligned using TopHat2 to the mm10 reference genome, differential expression was assessed using edgeR, and enrichment analysis was performed using curated databases including GO or KEGG PATHWAY mapping.
The tandem mass spectra were searched against the UniProt mouse protein database, and sequences of known contaminants such as keratin and porcine trypsin concatenated to a decoy database in which the sequence for each entry in the original database was reversed.
Our data suggest that Miz1 down-regulation–induced sustained activation of NF-κB–dependent inflammation in the lung epithelium is sufficient to induce progressive lung and airway destruction that recapitulates features of COPD, with implications for COVID-19.
