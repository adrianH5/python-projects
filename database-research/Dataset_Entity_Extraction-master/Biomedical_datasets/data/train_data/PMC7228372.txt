The recent pandemic of COVID‐19 is yet another manifestation of the might of natural selection.
The recent outbreak of COVID‐19, now categorized as a pandemic, is by all means considerably widespread compared with earlier coronavirus outbreaks.
The findings provide interesting insights into the potential relationship between natural genetic variants in human ACE2 and susceptibility and/or resistance against COVID‐19 infection.
The present investigation highlights candidate alleles of ACE2 that may lead to the variation in the susceptibility and/or resistance against COVID‐19.
Finally, clinical manifestations and recovery rate of COVID‐19 varies significantly between different age groups, nationalities, and race.

It is possible that in some individuals, if not all, the positive prognosis of the COVID‐19 may be due to the existence of ACE2 variants like rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G).
Therefore, the findings of this investigation provide clues to screen frequencies of the candidate alleles in different populations to predict the prognosis of COVID‐19.
The recent pandemic of COVID‐19, caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, is unarguably the most fearsome compared with the earlier outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV.
The findings provide direction to the targeted allele screening in COVID‐19 patients, which could further be used in predicting the prognosis of the disease and allocation of the health resources.
