After exposure to SARS-COV-2, susceptible individuals can develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consisting of symptoms that may range from fever and cough to severe respiratory illness; in some cases, COVID-19 is life-threatening (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a; Wadman, 2020).
Since the onset of the outbreak, more than 10 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, accounting for more than 500,000 deaths (COVID-19, 2020).
By April 2019, the states of New York and Michigan were the most severely affected (COVID-19, 2020), given that the metropolitan areas of New York City and Detroit possess large populations subject to health disparities that include limited access to health care, chronic exposure to pollution, and pre-existing cardiovascular conditions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b).
Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a potential high-risk population in light of the COVID-19 outbreak (Dashraath et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Rasmussen et al., 2020; Ashokka et al., 2020; Della Gatta et al., 2020; Weber LeBrun et al., 2020; Tekbali, 2020; Vintzileos, 2020; Lokken, 2020) given that viral infections such as influenza (Neuzil et al., 1998; Lindsay et al., 2006; Jamieson et al., 2006; Cervantes-Gonzalez and Launay, 2010; Pandemic H1N1 Influenza in Pregnancy Working Group et al., 2010; Mosby et al., 2011; Pazos et al., 2012; Raj et al., 2014), varicella (Triebwasser et al., 1967; Paryani and Arvin, 1986; Esmonde et al., 1989; Haake et al., 1990; Swamy and Dotters-Katz, 2019), Ebola (Olgun, 2018; Muehlenbachs et al., 2017), and measles (Christensen et al., 1954; Atmar et al., 1992) show increased severity in this physiological state.
Consequently, the clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 appear similar to those of non-pregnant adults (Yu et al., 2020).
Yet, recent reports have shown that severe COVID-19 can lead to maternal death (Hantoushzadeh et al., 2020; Blitz, 2020).
Consistently, infants born to mothers with COVID-19 test negative for SARS-CoV-2, do not develop serious clinical symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, diarrhea, or abnormal radiologic or hematologic evidence), and are promptly discharged from the hospital (Chen et al., 2020c).
Case reports have shown that a small fraction of neonates born to women with COVID-19 tested positive for the virus at 1–4 days of life (Zeng et al., 2020a; Alzamora et al., 2020), yet these neonates subsequently tested negative on day 6-7 (Zeng et al., 2020a).
In addition, serological studies revealed that a few neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had increased concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)M as well as IgG (Zeng et al., 2020b; Dong et al., 2020b).
In the first case report, the viral RNA was detected in amniotic fluid from a woman who was severely affected and died of COVID-19 (Zamaniyan, 2020).
Our first-trimester data are in agreement with a prior report showing minimal expression of ACE2 at the human maternal-fetal interface (Zheng et al., 2020); however, the same dataset was recently used to report the opposite (Li et al., 2020).
Finally, we explored the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in third-trimester placental tissues by mining two microarray datasets that we have previously reported (Kim et al., 2009; Toft et al., 2008).
This reduced expression contrasts with the high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal goblet and ciliated cells within the human airways, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, which are targeted during COVID-19 (Muus, 2020; Wang, 2020b; HCA Lung Biological Network et al., 2020).
The expression of additional SARS-CoV-2-related receptors or proteins in the human placenta is shown in Figure 2, CoV-Alt; however, further research is required to test their participation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
Therefore, it is unlikely that this protein alone is a sufficient requirement for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and other proteins may be required to explain the cell type primarily affected by COVID-19.
The cellular receptors and mechanisms that could be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 are still under investigation (Gordon et al., 2020), yet single-cell atlases can help to identify cell types with a similar transcriptional profile to those that are known to participate in COVID-19.
Data for third-trimester samples previously collected by our group are available through NIH dbGAP (accession number phs001886.v2.p1), and newly generated second-trimester scRNA-seq and third-trimester snRNA-seq data are being deposited into the same repository (Supplementary file 1).
Gene expression data for the study by Kim et al., 2009 was available from the www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/ database (entry ID: E-TABM-577), while data for the study by Toft et al., 2008 is available in our data repertoire.
The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 10 million people, including pregnant women.
