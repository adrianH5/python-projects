Likewise, in December of 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing the Coronavirus Infection Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, represents the third coronavirus to jump the species barrier to cause severe fatal disease in humans, leading to an unprecedented devastating global pandemic that has left the world paralyzed.
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (residues 319–529) (GenBank: MN975262.1), of SARS-CoV-1 (residues 306–515) (Urbani strain; AAP13441.1), and of CoV-HKU1 (residues 310–677) (Accession #: AY597011) were cloned into a pVRC vector with a C-terminal SBP-tag and expressed in HEK293F cells and purified as previously published Bajic et al., 2019.
To confirm that RBD-specific responses can differentiate individuals that have been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 from those that have not been exposed, RBD-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA responses were probed in a group of convalescent (individuals who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and later recovered, as confirmed by two negative RNA tests) and negative community controls.
Critical to managing the spread of COVID-19 is the ability to diagnose infection and define the acquired immune response across the population.
