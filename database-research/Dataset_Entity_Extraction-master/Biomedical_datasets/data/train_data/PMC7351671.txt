Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease known as COVID-19, was originated in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020).
Among others, symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath (Chen et al., 2020).
Generally, the mutation occurs when an error is incorporated in a viral genome (Fleischmann, 1996).
The genomic sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 virus was collected from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)2
in fasta format on 11th June 2020.
The dataset contains 566 genomes with sequence ID and sequence in fasta format.
We have extracted the date from the sequence ID to show the number of sequences uploaded per month.
Moreover, the original and shorter sequence IDs (for better visualization) and the length of each genome are mentioned in the supplementary Table S1.
The wave of COVID-19 is a big threat to the human population.
