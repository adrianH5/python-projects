Recently, novel coronavirus (virus, SARS-COV2; disease, COVID-19) infection and its related mortality are so severe internationally that the WHO declared it as a pandemic.
They concluded that this triple drug treatment has a superior effect in curing COVID-19 patients than lopinavir-ritonavir or ribavirin alone (Hung et al. 2020).
Thus, clinical trials of IFN-beta supplement could be considered an effective treatment for COVID-19.
Taken together, an IFN-beta supplement might aid in preventing COVID-19 infection and help in development of herd immunity.
