The enrichment probe set contains 502 single‐stranded DNA biotin‐labeled probes at 2× tiling designed based on all available SARS‐CoV‐2 viral sequences, downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; https://www.gisaid.org/) on 1 February 2020, and it can be used to enrich for SARS‐CoV‐2 sequences without prior knowledge of type or subtype.
Five clades could be identified and labeled, corresponding to the full genome tree delivered by GISAID (see Figure S1).
Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, marked enrichment was demonstrated in a virus strain sample from cell culture, three nasopharyngeal swab samples (cycle threshold [ C  t ] values: 32.36, 36.72, and 38.44) from patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 (positive control) and four throat swab samples from patients without COVID‐19 (negative controls), respectively.
