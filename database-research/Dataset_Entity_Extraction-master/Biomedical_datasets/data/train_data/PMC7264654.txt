The SARS outbreak of 2002–2004, the MERS outbreaks since 2012 and the current COVID‐19 outbreak since 2019 demonstrate the potential of coronaviruses, especially bat‐derived betacoronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020), to cause PHEICs, with COVID‐19 having escalated to a global pandemic.
For the ongoing COVID‐19 outbreak, as illustrated in Figure 1, applying in silico approaches can rapidly provide answers to questions like:
Is the first sequenced SARS‐CoV‐2 genome (often called the ‘reference genome’ in GISAID, GenBank, etc.) closest to the original or ‘true reference’ strain which entered humans (which may not have been sequenced and/or which may still be circulating with minimal mutations)?
All available viral sequences were downloaded from GISAID (on 05/03/2020, see Appendix S3 (Elbe, & Buckland‐Merrett, 2017)), filtering for complete sequences of human origin (187 genomes in total).
We also included one recently reported viral sequence from the European Virus Archive global (Ref‐SKU: 026V‐03883) and the two Australian sequences in the full data set.
This data set of 181 sequences was aligned against each other using Muscle (v3.8.31) (Madeira et al., 2019).
The C1 cluster mainly represents Wuhan and isolates captured early on; C2 and C3 contain later isolates, such as Sydney/3, Australia/VIC01 and France/IDF0372 in C2 and Australia/NSW01, Australia/QLD01‐3, Australia/VIC02 and USA/WA1 in C3.
There may also be three additional clusters emerging (C4‐6) with C4 capturing the suspected community spread from Lombardy (‘Narrative: Genomic analysis of COVID‐19 spread’, n.d.), C5 regionally mixed (Asia and North Amerika) and C6 from Australia and Asia, notably Australia/NSW05‐7 (see fully annotated tree in Figure S5).
Their analysis was only on 103 GISAID isolates and includes betacoronaviruses from bats, which roots the tree differently and merges C1 and C2.
However, this alignment‐free method positions isolates with deletions (viz. Australia/VIC01 and Canada/ON‐VIDO‐01) further away from Wuhan‐Hu‐1 than in the phylogenetic tree, demonstrating the ability of the K‐mer method to represent deletions accurately (see Supplemental Table 7).
While Nextstrain ('Narrative: Genomic analysis of COVID‐19 spread', n.d.) is a powerful aid in visualizing the available strains in real time, it currently relies on phylogeny only and thus may be hampered in its conclusions.
C2 is represented by Australia/VIC01 and France/IDF0372, and C3 is represented by USA/WA1.
The central location of Germany/BavPat1 and France/IDF0372 may reflect a broad representation across multiple clusters, in contrast to Canada/ON‐VIDO‐01 and Australia/VIC01, which are located further away from the SARS‐CoV‐2 centre marked by the rectangle in Figure 4b inset.
The vertical lines hence cluster isolates with a similar number of ‘missing’ bases; for example, Australia/VIC01 and Canada/ON‐VIDO‐01 have 10‐bp deletions, while Korea/KCDC05 and Australia/Sydney02 have a 40‐bp shorter sequence and 42‐bp deletion, respectively.
Furthermore, releasing the full high‐throughput sequencing data sets rather than the consensus sequences would allow a more detailed exploration of the existing quasispecies to further improve isolate selection.
We discuss the currently chosen SARS‐CoV‐2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment‐free bioinformatic approach.
