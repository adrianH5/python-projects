Multiple sequence alignment of 21 full genomes obtained and 1563 full-genome sequences (Supplementary Table (available from )) available at the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (as of March 26, 2020) was carried out in MAFFT v.7.4509.
This tree was used to reduce the dataset to 121 sequences, on the basis of country and the genetic variant identified based on the GISAID classification.
Phylogenetic trees based on full-genome sequences deposited and available at GISAID revealed the diversification and the clustering of sequences into groups, based on the genetic variants.
To date, there are no other sequences from Iran in the GISAID database.
