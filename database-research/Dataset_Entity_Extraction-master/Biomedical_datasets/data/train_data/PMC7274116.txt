The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) started as an epidemic event in the city of Wuhan, China in late December 2019 and evolved as a pandemic declared by March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020, L. Wang et al., 2020).
According to the report of the World Health Organization as of 29 April 2020, the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 3,160,540 people and killed >219,253 people in >200 countries throughout the world, and only few countries appear to have passed the peak.
In Italy have been recorded 201,505 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 27,359 fatalities.
In Italy outbreak of COVID-19 started in Lombardy county, first 3 COVID-19 cases have been reported on 15 February 2020.
Early studies estimated the risk of COVID-19 cases importation to Europe by air travel from infected areas in China (Pullano et al., 2020).
Also, air pollution is exacerbating the susceptibility and severity of respiratory viral infections like as coronaviruses (SARS, MARS and COVID-19), with a high impact on host morbidity and mortality and public health all over the world (Manisalidis et al., 2020; Pothirat et al., 2019).
Besides environmental pollution, climate change and increased frequency of extreme events as a recorded feedback of anthropogenic pollution can also affect the geographical distribution of several infectious diseases including COVID-19 (Kawasaki et al., 2019; Linares et al., 2020).
As an infectious viral disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019) arised from viruses, like previous outbreaks: 2002–2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) viruses and 2012–2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), belongs to human Beta coronaviruses category.
COVID-19 is a spherical or pleomorphic enveloped particle with an average diameter size of 0.1 μm in the range of 0.06–0.14 μm, and contains single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein (Mousavizadeh and Ghasemi, 2020; Y.
Advanced new studies attribute the fatalities of COVID-19 to cytokine storm syndrome (Guo et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020), also known as hypercytokinemia, which is characterized by an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tisoncik et al., 2012), being a severe reaction of the immunity system, leading to death.
Table 1
summarizes the Pearson coefficients and p-values descriptive statistics of COVID-19 Milan cases (Total confirmed, Daily New positive and Total Deaths) and daily average ground level gaseous pollutants O3 and NO2 concentrations together daily average climate variables (Planetary Boundary Layer height, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed intensity and precipitation rate).
Due to COVID-19 pandemic event, starting with the end of February 2020 lockdown (as can be seen on Fig. 2), where drastic measures for reduction of air pollution were adopted to limit the spread of the coronavirus, our study revealed different concentrations levels for O3 and NO2 corresponding to pre-pandemic period (January–February) and beyond lockdown (March–April) 2020, namely: NO2 in Milan city has decreased by approximately 64.7%, while O3 has increased by a factor of 2.25.
Our results have shown that the severe reductions in NO2 and other air pollution emissions during Milan's COVID-19 lockdown led to substantial increases in ground level O3, which in turn increased atmospheric oxidizing capacity and enhanced formation of secondary aerosols, with subsequent negative impact on human respiratory health and increasing of COVID-19 confirmed and fatalities numbers.
For this reason we considered O3 as a COVID incubator.
Also this study found that daily average ground level ozone concentrations values were positive correlated with all COVID-19 cases (confirmed Total, confirmed Daily New positive and Total Deaths) as can be seen in Table 1 and Fig.
2. A similar result was recently reported for COVID-19 infections and ozone in Italy (Pansini and Fornacca, 2020).
Also, was found a negative correlation between average ground levels of NO2 and COVID-19 cases (Total, confirmed Daily New positive cases and Total Deaths) as can be seen in Table 1 and Fig.
Based on our analysis was found that daily average PBL values were positive correlated with all COVID-19 cases (confirmed Total, confirmed Daily New positive and Total Deaths) as can be seen in Fig. 3
.
Furthermore, air temperature also contributes towards the transmission of the virus (Chen et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) suggesting that humidity and temperature will play an important role in COVID-19 mortality rate.
Climate indicators and air temperature are well correlated with the spread of COVID-19 (Poole, 2020; Ahmadi et al., 2020).
This can explain the high rate of total COVID-19 positive cases registered in the metropolitan area of Milan, possibly attributed to bronchial hyperreactivity and immune disorders through several pathways.
Among the climate variables, wind speed has a weakly inverse relationship with the recorded COVID-19 cases (Total confirmed, Daily New positive), as can be seen in Table 2.
Statistical Pearson correlation shows that precipitation rate recorded in Milan metropolitan region had important effects on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infection COVID-19, being negatively correlated with Daily New positive cases (R2 = 0.21 with significant p-value of 0.09 > 0.05 and also low negatively correlations with Total COVID-19 and Total Deaths cases with significant p-values > 0.05, as can be seen in Table 1.
Omega meteorological chart 950 mb (0.762 km above sea level) is a better choice for our analysis because daily average PBL value recorded for Milan area was (797.53 ± 568.35) m. NOAA satellite Omega image for Italy in Europe (Fig. 6
) shows existing atmospheric thermal inversion conditions over Milan and Lombardy region, associated with accumulation near the ground of high air pollutants concentrations (non-viable aerosols and viable-bioaerosols including viruses like as coronaviruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.) leading to a higher risk of COVID-19 infections development (Ogen, 2020).
Local favorable stagnant atmospheric conditions due to local topography of Milan area, the preexisting high levels of air pollutants during January–February 2020 can explain the high incidence of people's respiratory diseases and increased susceptibility to new viral infections COVID-19.
Long-term conditions of population exposure (several years before 2020) when the number of days in which the regulatory limits of O3, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 have been exceeded (EEA, European Environmental Agency, 2019, EEA, European Environmental Agency, 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) in Milan metropolitan region as well as short-term exposure to high ground levels of O3, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 can be correlated with the decreased people's immunity and immunopathology to viruses, and high fatality COVID-19 rates observed in Milan and Lombardy region.
As an important result, our analysis show the direct correlation of daily averaged ground levels O3 and NO2, with meteorological factors on COVID-19 infections outbreak in Milan.
In spite of cold season investigated period (winter-early spring) collected data, when usually recorded urban ozone levels have lower values than its summer peak concentrations, the findings of this study demonstrate that ground level ozone possible acts as a COVID-19 virus incubator, being positively correlated with COVID-19 infections and fatalities (Fig. 7
).
It seems that under specific climate conditions (Bashir et al., 2020), air pollution acts as a carrier of the COVID-19 virus, facilitating its transmission and spreading, allowing its survival in active form with different residence times.
Association between Milan, with several days of smog and haze, which favor air pollutants accumulation near the ground level in cold and dry winter to spring seasons and the highest number of COVID-19 infection cases (Total confirmed, Daily New positive and Total Deaths), thereby is supports the possibility as the degree of air pollution and local topography together climate conditions may contribute to accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 cases.
Exhibited positive correlations of ambient ozone levels and negative correlations of NO 2 with the increased rates of COVID-19 infections (Total number, Daily New positive and Total Deaths cases), can be attributed to airborne bioaerosols distribution.
At this moment it is not clear if through airborne diffusion, in the presence of outdoor and indoor aerosols, this protein “spike” of the new COVID-19 is involved in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host during the highest nosocomial outbreak in some agglomerated industrialized urban areas like Milan is.
Also, in spite of collected data for cold season (winter-early spring) period, when usually ozone levels have lower values than in summer, the findings of this study support possibility as O 3 can acts as a COVID-19 virus incubator.
