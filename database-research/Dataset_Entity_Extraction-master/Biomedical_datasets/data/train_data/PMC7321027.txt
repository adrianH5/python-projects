Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web Science, Scopus, MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were used to search using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), free text words and all possible combination.
Thus, it seems that the immunoinformatics-based approachs are required to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the COVID-19.
In these studies, the proteins of COVID-19 virus that have an essential role in virulence of the virus was selected and then its antigenic properties was examined.
More for the most part, our deliberate assistance highlights the potential importance of past clinical and exploratory considerations for SARS-CoV, and is used in conjunction with growing information for SARS-CoV-2, in the search for compelling immunizations to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.
The beginning of 2020 was marked as the emergence of a COVID-19 outbreak caused by a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
