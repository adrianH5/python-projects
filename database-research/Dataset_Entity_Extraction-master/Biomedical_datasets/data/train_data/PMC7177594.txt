Emerging in late 2019, the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated rapidly around the globe and has been declared a pandemic [5,6].
After initially optimizing the hydrolysis probe-based version of the assay to show that it reached the sensitivity of our previously published COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay (data not shown), we used only the primers (nsp2f: 5′-ATGCATTTGCATCAGAGGCT-3′, nsp2r: 5′-TTGTTATAGCGGCCTTCTGT-3′), to develop the subsequent probe-free, COVID-19-nsp2 real-time RT-PCR assay.
To determine the analytical sensitivity of the COVID-19-nsp2 assay, the limit of detection (LOD) was evaluated by using viral genomic RNA extracted from a culture isolate of SARS-CoV-2.
The LOD of the COVID-19-nsp2 assay was 1.8 TCID50/mL (Table 2).
Using TNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2 isolate at different concentrations, the new COVID-19-nsp2 assay was performed in triplicate for each concentration to evaluate the intra- and inter-assay variations.
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the assay, 59 clinical specimens (23 positive and 36 negative) from 14 confirmed cases (defined as at least one respiratory specimen positive for SARS-CoV-2 by our previously established COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay) [24] were used.
Twenty-three were positive (including 22 respiratory specimens and 1 stool specimen, with Cp values ranged from 18.69 to 36.21) and 36 were negative (including four respiratory and 32 non-respiratory specimens) by the COVID-19-nsp2 assay.
The melting curve from COVID-19-nsp2-positive specimens showed a unique peak with the melting temperature of around 80 °C.
The results from the two assays were 100% concordant, and no additional positive result was detected from the specimens previously tested negative by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay.
Early in the COVID-19 outbreak, when the virus was reported to be related to the SARS-CoV and the exact genomic variation of the virus was not adequately known [25], multiple groups developed and published assays based on conserved regions that could potentially detect additional coronaviruses [26,27] (see also https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance).
In the present study, we demonstrated that the diagnostic performance of the hydrolysis probe-free COVID-19-nsp2 assay was comparable to that of our previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay [24].
The current nsp2 assay was highly specific (without cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses) and comparable to the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay in terms of analytical sensitivity.
The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the nsp2 assay was 100% in comparison with the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay in this study.
Furthermore, the PCR reaction time of the nsp2 assay was within an hour, which is shorter than that of the previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay [24]; this is a distinct advantage in clinical laboratories, as rapid results can facilitate the timely triage of suspected COVID-19 cases and guide infection control and patient management.
As COVID-19 unfolded into a pandemic, rapid, robust and sensitive diagnostic testing became a priority in containment-based control strategies.
As nucleic acid amplification-based testing allows exquisite sensitivity (1.8 TCID50/mL in our case) and can be readily adopted in laboratories with basic molecular facilities, it is an essential tool in the clinical management and triage of patients.
The robust design of the optimized assay, requiring only one pair of SARS-CoV-2-specific primers to diagnose COVID-19 infection in humans, avoids the potential logistics, reagent and manpower constraints in performing multiple or cascade testing or the use of relatively costly reporter probes.
Using the software tool, degenerate bases may be strategically incorporated into the COVID-19-nsp2 assay primers to broaden the specificity, or additional targets may be iteratively identified from further coronavirus pan-genome analyses.
The GolayMetaMiner software first downloads the genomes of the target and non-target species from the NCBI nucleotide database and generates a pool of nucleotide k-mers (k = 12 by default) for both forward and reverse directions of the non-target genomes.
The longer of the two SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced by our group [23], HKU-SZ-005b, was used as the reference genome (--primary_target MN975262), and a list of accession numbers of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were used as secondary targets (--secondary_target_list SARS-CoV-2_genomes.txt); the accession number of the reference genome was manually commented out with a “#” to avoid double-counting the reference genome in estimating conservedness.
The lists of accession numbers of the 96 SARS-CoV-2 and 104 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes are available in Supplementary Materials.
SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient in Hong Kong as previously described [42].
The viral isolate stock (1.8 × 107 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/mL) was prepared using VeroE6 cells as previously described [20,24,43].
For assay performance evaluation, 59 archived clinical specimens (26 respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab, throat swab, endotracheal aspirate, sputum and saliva, and 33 non-respiratory specimens including plasma, urine, rectal swab/stool) from 14 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were used [24].
These specimens were evaluated previously using the established COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay [24].
The pandemic novel coronavirus infection, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has affected at least 190 countries or territories, with 465,915 confirmed cases and 21,031 deaths.
The new COVID-19-nsp2 assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 TCID 50 /mL and did not amplify other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses.
Evaluation of the new assay using 59 clinical specimens from 14 confirmed cases showed 100% concordance with our previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel reference assay.
A rapid, sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific real-time RT-PCR assay, COVID-19-nsp2, was developed.
