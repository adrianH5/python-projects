First case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and since then it has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic, with maximum death cases in Italy, although initially, the maximum mortality was reported from China [1].
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, as of 2 April 2020, there were confirmed 823626 COVID-19 cases and 40598 deaths, that included cases which were both locally transmitted or imported [2].
From India, there were only two full genome sequences submitted from the state of Kerala (GenBank accession numbers MT012098 {(isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/29/2020 or isolate 29) and MT050493 (isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/166/2020 or isolate 166)}.
Structure of the spike glycoprotein was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 6VXX) (Figure 5).
Abstract  Since 2002, Î² coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 late in 2019 (also named as COVID-19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019).
As the nCoV2019 takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are being done and genome sequences are being deposited in various databases.
