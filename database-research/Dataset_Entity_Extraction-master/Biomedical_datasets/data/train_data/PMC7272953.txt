Di Giambenedetto et al.
 described their experience with intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) in treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19).
Results of this case series appear to support efficacy and tolerability of TCZ given subcutaneously in patients with COVID‐19, at least in those with pneumonia not requiring mechanical ventilation.
Particularly, it has to be seen whether SC TCZ at single dose in early stages of COVID‐19 is equally effective to intravenous TCZ given at standard doses.
In particular, since SC TCZ was not administered further for rapid improvement of patient conditions, this suggest the possibility of reducing the dosage of TCZ, at least in patients with less severe COVID‐19.
