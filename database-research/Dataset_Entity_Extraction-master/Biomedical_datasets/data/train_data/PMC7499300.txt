Available datasets are more sparse for incidence, and the patterns are inconsistent between studies.
Analysis of datasets, specifically of serosurveys, needs to account for the kinetics of waning immunity and effects of imperfect assays to draw meaningful inferences.
We conducted searches of the PubMed database on March 20, 2020 using the search term “coronavirus” and each of the following terms or phrases: “serolog*”, “serop*”, “cross reactivity”, “antibod* human coronavirus”, and “complement fixation”.
Articles included electronic, ahead-of-print publications available in the PubMed database.
Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time.
