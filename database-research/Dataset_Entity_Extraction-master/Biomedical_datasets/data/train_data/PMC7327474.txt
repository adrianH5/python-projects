In the database and literature, a single report on Buffalo-originated coronavirus strain collected from Bangladesh (BufCoV-HKU26-M) is available (Lau et al., 2016).
The global risk of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19 [SARS-CoV-2]) has recently been addressed by many scientists (Bogoch et al., 2020, Chinazzi et al., 2020, Global Health Policy, 2020, Wu et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020).
Outside China, COVID-19 transmission has been found in over 210 countries and territories (Global Health Policy, 2020, WHO, 2020c).
As the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19 [SARS-CoV-2]) is spreading rapidly, the analysis of epidemiological data of COVID-19 is necessary to explore the disease burden and associated factors.
Spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and BufCoV-HKU26 were retrieved from the ViralZone root (https://viralzone.expasy.org/) and UniProt (https://www.UniProt.org/) databases (Supplementary File 1).
Additionally, we retrieved epidemiological data for COVID-19 from different websites, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and other online news portals (WHO, 2020c; ECDC, 2020; Pharmaceutical-technology, 2020; Reliefweb, 2020; Worldometers.
COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, 2020).
In this study, the conservancy pattern of mostly immunogenic B cell peptide sequences of COVID-19 was compared with other homologous sequences retrieved from the NCBI database by using BLASTp (Hasan et al., 2019b).
Moreover, homologous sequences of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins were retrieved from the NCBI database (Supplementary File 2) and were subjected to conservancy analysis with the immunogenic epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
It was found that antigenic sites are almost conserved in all of the homologous protein sequences deposited in the NCBI database (Table 2).
Cross-checked conservancy analysis of COVID-19 antigenic epitopes with SARS-CoV proteins showed that conservancy when cross-checked with other coronaviruses, including BufCoV-HKU26 of Bangladesh origin, was not significant (Table 3).
The 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins were modeled using the I-TASSER server, where ‘SARS-CoV complex with human neutralizing S230 antibody Fab fragment’ (PDB ID: 6NB6), ‘Membrane protein complex’ (PDB ID: 5X5Y), ‘Coronavirus Envelope Proteins’ (PDB ID: 2 MM4) and ‘SARS CoV Nucleocapsid’ (PDB ID: 1SSK) acted as the top threading templates of the S, M, E and N proteins, respectively.

Over two and half months, from its outbreak on 31 December 2019 to 20 March 2020, COVID-19 has spread to up to 182 countries and territories [Fig. 5(i)A] and one cruise ship named ‘Diamond Princess’ in Japan, affecting a total of 253,796persons globally, including in Bangladesh; however, China was the most affected country[Fig.
In addition, COVID-19 resulted in a substantial burden in Iran, Germany, United States of America (USA), France and South Korea infecting 19,644, 17,372, 14,366, 10,995 and 8652 persons, respectively.
Fascinatingly, after 25 February 2020, cases outside China increased more than those in China, which was an alarming signal that COVID-19 became a pandemic [Fig. 5(i)and Supplementary Fig. 1].
The first death by COVID-19 occurred on 11 January 2000, and by 19 January 2020, another three persons had died.
Among 182 countries and territories, 67 countries had experienced deaths from the COVID-19 outbreak by 20 March 2020.
In China, 28 of 34 provinces experienced deaths from COVID-19, and the highest death toll occurred in Hubei (3122) Province, followed by Henan (22) and Heilongjiang (13); in other provinces, the death toll was below ten up until 19 March 2020 (Supplementary File 4).

The COVID-19, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, became a pandemic (Jung et al., 2020).
Although the causative agent of COVID-19 has already been declared SARS-CoV-2 (Lai et al., 2020, Phan, 2020), we adopted a protein-based phylogenetic study to reveal the phylogenetic relationships and divergent links of SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronavirus strains.
Seven coronaviruses (COVID-19, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1 and MERS-CoV), two bat-originated coronaviruses (HKU4 and HKU5) and one buffalo-originated coronavirus (BufCoV-HKU26) reported from Bangladesh were subjected to phylogenetic analysis of four types of their viral proteins (S, M, E and N proteins).
In the NCBI database, the gene sequence of a buffalo coronavirus (BufCoV HKU26) from domestic water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in Bangladesh is available (Lau et al., 2016).
COVID-19 has already spread to all continents except Antarctica.
The temperature could be a factor reducing the risks of COVID-19 to Bangladesh, although the country has a high-risk index (Haider et al., 2020a).
The high temperature and high humidity can effectively reduce the environmental persistence and transmission of the COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020a), and temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality (Ma et al., 2020).
COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) might have different persistence times on inanimate surfaces, but these times should be similar to those of SARS-associated viruses (3-4 days) (Kramer et al., 2006).
Recently, the authors established that temperature significantly changed COVID-19 transmission in 429 cities, in which COVID-19 appeared to spread fastest at 8.72°C (Wang et al., 2020b).
Thus, in affected countries, COVID-19 might disappear with rising temperatures when spring comes.
Only 20 cases (including one death) of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Bangladesh as of March 20, 2020.
Many of the scientists speculated and revealed that high temperature and humidity have a role in restricting the spread of COVID-19, and the spread of disease would be suppressed in hot and humid weather (Sajadi et al., 2020, Zhang and Zeng, 2020), are in the line of our hypothesis.
The antigenic sites of COVID-19 were also crosschecked with other coronavirus-corresponding proteins (Table 3).
Similar to COVID-19, the world experienced an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 caused by a coronavirus also originating from China (Guangdong Province), which was suggested to be a potential zone of re-emergence of coronaviruses (Lai et al., 2020; WHO, 2020d).
However, on March 14, 2020 WHO declared Europe as new epicentre of COVID-19 outbreak (www.who.int).
Within a very short time, COVID-19 was transmitted globally (WHO, 2020c;
COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, 2020), infecting 2,53,796 persons globally (WHO, 2020c).
Therefore, COVID-19 has already covered approximately 5.52 times more countries than SARS and MERS (WHO, 2020c; Chen et al., 2005).
In addition, up to March 20, 2020, COVID-19 has been attributed 30.03 and 101.76 times more cases, and 12.85 and 12.13 times more deaths globally than SARS and MERS, respectively (Worldometers.
COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, 2020; Chen et al., 2005; WHO, 2020b).
For example, all of Italy has been placed under lockdown due to COVID-19.
The majority of the cases are in mainland China, followed by Italy, Spain, Iran, Germany, USA, France and Korea and the World Health Organization has formally declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 11, 2020 (WHO, 2020c; Jung et al., 2020).
The case fatality of COVID-19 as of March 19, 2020 was 4.10% and 4.00% globally and in China, respectively.
However, the global case fatalities of SARS (9.60%) and MERS (34.40%) were higher than that of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020b; Cameron et al., 2008).
COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, 2020), which supports our estimate.
Despite the lower case fatality than the previous coronaviruses SARS and MERS, COVID-19 poses a great burden across the world in terms of geographical coverage, the occurrence of cases, and the cumulative death toll.
Over 182 countries and territories including Bangladesh reported COVID-19 cases, with more than 2,53,796 people infected globally as of March 20, 2020 (Global Health Policy, 2020, WHO, 2020c).
The COVID-19 coronavirus has spread in the neighboring countries of Bangladesh as well.
Further comprehensive studies that will combine genomic data, outbreak information, surveillance data, travel restrictions will help to generate information that will be necessary for a well-planned long-term strategy to mitigate COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus strain responsible for COVID-19, has emerged in Wuhan City, China, and continuing its global pandemic nature.
Descriptive epidemiological analysis on several epidemiological indices was performed on available epidemiological outbreak information from several open databases on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).
•  COVID-19 poses a great burden across the world in terms of geographical coverage, occurrence of cases and death toll.
