Significance Statement  Kidney involvement may occur in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and can be severe among Black individuals.
In this study of collapsing glomerulopathy in six Black patients with COVID-19, the authors found that all six had variants in the gene encoding apo L1 (APOL1) that are more common among those of African descent and linked by past research to susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy in non–COVID-19 patients.
Visual Abstract         Background  Kidney involvement is a feature of COVID-19 and it can be severe in Black patients.
To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six Black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury–associated genes.
This case series included six Black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years.
Conclusions  Collapsing glomerulopathy in Black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants.
Given this entity’s resemblance with HIV-associated nephropathy, we propose the term COVID-19–associated nephropathy to describe it.
