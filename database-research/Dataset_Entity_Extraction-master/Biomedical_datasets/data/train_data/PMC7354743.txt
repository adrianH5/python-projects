One major hitch in developing a COVID-19 vaccine is that no medically proven predecessor exists for any type of human coronavirus.
While influenza, like COVID-19, causes morbidity among all ages, those most vulnerable to its serious complications, such as pneumonia, are the elderly [17, 18].
The mechanisms of the ‘cytokine storm’ and how they contribute to fatalities reported for COVID-19 are still under investigation.
In a study of 41 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were found, including IL-2, IL-7, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α, in the most severe cases [119].
The fight against COVID-19 will be difficult and lengthy.
During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the global ratio between the dead and the survivors is approximately 1 to 10, which has put humanity on high alert and provided strong motivation for the intensive search for vaccines and drugs.
The experience accumulated dealing with the biology of zoonotic RNA viruses suggests that the fight against COVID-19 will be difficult and lengthy.
Unfortunately, RNA viruses constantly sweep their tracks and perhaps one of the most promising solutions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is the creation of 'universal' vaccines based on conservative SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (antigen-presenting) and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (adjuvant) in the composition of the phosphorothioate backbone of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN), which can be effective for long periods of use.
