SARS-CoV-2, first isolated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] is a new coronavirus responsible for the severe pulmonary/systemic disease called COVID-19.
Here, the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed by the Virology Laboratory of Ancona University Hospital on the 25 February 2020.
Several research centres started sequencing programs on different platforms and some results are already available [2,4,5,6] in databases such as Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID, https://www.gisaid.org/) or GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/), which will continue to accumulate sequencing data from around the world.
Reads were aligned with the Wuhan-Hu-1 NCBI Reference Genome (Accession number: MN908947.3) on the Torrent Suite v. 5.10.1.
The following plugins were used: Coverage Analysis (v5.10.0.3), Variant Caller ( v.5.10.1.19) both with “Generic - S5/S5XL (510/520/530) - Somatic - Low Stringency” and “Generic-S5/S5XL (510/520/530)-Germ Line-Low Stringency” default parameters and COVID19AnnotateSnpEff (v.1.0.0), a plugin specifically developed for Sars-Cov-2 that can predict the effect of a base substitution.
