In December 31, 2019, the epidemic of novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, which has caused pneumonia by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that the main route to spread of the COVID-19 virus is human-to-human transmission.
COVID-19 has a very contagious nature and rapidly spreads to all developed and developing countries (WHO, 2020a; WHO, 2020b; Ma et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020; Noorimotlagh et al., 2020).
In Islamic Republic (IR) of Iran, on February 19, 2020, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education official announcement reported the first death caused by COVID-19 (Takian et al., 2020; Faridi et al., 2020).
According to WHO situation report-108 on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, on May 7, 2020, Iran was reported to have 103,330 and 6496 total confirmed cases and total deaths, respectively, which was the highest ranking among Eastern Mediterranean countries (WHO, 2020a).
The very high prevalence of COVID-19 in the world has triggered rigorous investigations to determine the clinical characteristics and severity of the novel coronavirus disease and its potential transmission route including airborne transmission.
The present study was carried out on May 7, 2020, in Shahid Mustafa Khomeini Hospital wards in Ilam province, East of Iran, assigned for patients' treatment with confirmed COVID-19.
Ilam, with 580,000 population, was then reported to have 576 and 54 confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively.
All of the suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the other cities were transferred to Shahid Mustafa Khomeini Hospital.
In the present study, the liquid impinger biosampler (liquid-phase sampler, SKC biosampler) was consumed as a highly efficient technique to capture airborne viruses in bio-aerosol sampling of the COVID-19 virus in the different wards of the hospital.
The novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) has recently emerged and rapidly spread through all developed and developing countries and caused a pandemic with great health burden worldwide.
As depicted in Table 3, there were 183 patients confirmed with COVID-19 with different conditions from severe and critical to mild circumstances.
Ong et al. (2020) suggest that environment, due to the significant contamination caused by respiratory droplets and fecal shedding of patients with confirmed COVID-19, is the potential medium of transmission (Ong et al., 2020).
However, the main routes of preventing and limiting the exposure to COVID-19 recommended by WHO are hand washing and observing social distance (WHO, 2020a; Morawska and Cao, 2020).
These measures could not prevent people infection through inhalation of small droplets and aerosols emission by a COVID-19 patients (in many cases they are asymptomatic) that can travel distance of meters or 10 of meters in the air and transmit the viable virus of SARS-CoV-2.
In another similar study, about aerodynamic characteristics and RNA concentration of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol in Wuhan hospitals during COVID-19 outbreak, Liu et al. (2020) confirmed that the resuspension process of the virus aerosol, which deposit on protective apparel or floor surface, could be a potential transmission route.
On December 31, 2019, the novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China and swiftly spread in all nations and territories around the globe.
Therefore, we examined the potential aerosol transmission of the virus through hospital wards indoor air by confirmed COVID-19 patients on May 7, 2020.
Accordingly, we found two positive air samples (in the ICU) out of 14 ones taken from different wards with confirmed COVID-19 patients.
