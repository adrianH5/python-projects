During the cruise, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak occurred among the passengers and crew members, ultimately resulting in 712 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases with 13 deaths [1], the largest disease outbreak involving a cruise ship to date.
Investigation into the Diamond Princess outbreak provides further evidence of the case fatality ratio (CFR) of COVID-19 in isolation.
Epidemiological findings on COVID-19 are increasingly linked to information from whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2.
