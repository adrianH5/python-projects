Kaletra (an inhibitor of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of the SARS and MERS), and Ascletis (HIV protease inhibitor) were shown to improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020).
However, the active form (CHEMBL2016761) of Remdesivir showed perfect docking in the overlapping region of the NTP binding motif urging its validation through clinical trials for COVID-19 infection (Chang et al., 2020).
In line with this, several studies have recently explored the repurposing of drugs to find an immediate therapeutic strategy for the deadly COVID-19, by mainly targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Aanouz et al., 2020; Al-Khafaji et al., 2020; Das et al., 2020; Enmozhi et al., 2020; Gyebi et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020; Khan, Jha, et al., 2020; Khan, Zia, et al.
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with N3 inhibitor, resolved using X-ray diffraction (resolution of 2.16 Å), was downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6LU7).
The structure of Wi-A (CID 265237), Wi-N (CID 21679027) and CAPE (CID 5281787) were downloaded from the PubChem database, while the structure of the N3 inhibitor was extracted from SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-inhibitor complex downloaded from PDB (PDB ID: 6LU7).
Data presented here predicted that these natural compounds may possess the potential to inhibit the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease (an essential protein for virus survival), and hence (i) may connect to save time and cost required for designing/development, and initial screening for anti-COVID drugs, (ii) may offer some therapeutic value for the management of novel fatal coronavirus disease, (iii) warrants prioritized further validation in the laboratory and clinical tests.
