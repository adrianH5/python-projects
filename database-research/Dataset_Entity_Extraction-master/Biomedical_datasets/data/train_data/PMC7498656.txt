As government restrictions put in place to slow the acceleration of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic start to ease, many people, including elite athletes, will begin to return back to their normal daily activities.
Although the majority of risk factors for severe COVID-19—hypertension, respiratory system disease, obesity, older age, and cardiovascular disease—are exceptionally rare in elite athletes, when athletes train in groups or common training areas, they are not immune from contracting the illness; and, although the subsequent risk of death is low, it is not zero.
It has been estimated that 22% of the global population are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected.
One area with potential early promise is that of genetic testing, with a number of genetic variants tentatively associated with an increased susceptibility to, and an increased chance of complications from, contracting COVID-19.,
So far, 4 studies4, 5, 6, 7 have shown that at least 6 DNA polymorphisms might be implicated in COVID-19 severity, with the ABO blood group (ABO) rs657152 A, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) D, apolipoprotein E (APOE) rs429358 C, leucine zipper transcription factor like 1 (LZTFL1) rs11385942 GA, transmembrane protein 189-ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1 (TMEM189-UBE2V1) rs6020298 A, and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) rs12329760
We thus hypothesized that polygenic risk scores for COVID-19 severity based on 6 DNA polymorphisms may vary across different sporting groups (endurance and power oriented).
Using the 1000 Genomes database and our own data of 802 Russian elite athletes and 224 controls (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Methods), we first identified the proportion of subjects with increased risk in each population.
In conclusion, we identified that team sport, power, and combat athletes possess a higher genetic risk for COVID-19 severity than untrained subjects or endurance athletes.
Highlights     •  Predictive genetic testing of an asymptomatic person has considerable potential to predict future risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity.
Risk alleles for COVID-19 severity due to the pleiotropic effects are associated with performance-related traits.
Team sport, power, and combat athletes possess a higher genetic risk for COVID-19 severity than untrained subjects or endurance athletes.
