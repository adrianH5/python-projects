As the 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 spreads globally, differences in adverse clinical management outcomes have been associated with age >65 years, male gender, and comorbidities such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular comorbidity, and immunosuppression.
In addition to ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, prior vaccinations, exposure to other coronaviruses, and other factors need to be considered to explain the geographical and regional variations in susceptibility and severity of the clinical expression of COVID-19 disease and outcomes.
In the United States, there have been disproportionate COVID-19 death rates among African Americans at around 2.6 times higher than that of other groups.
Some individuals with COVID-19 experienced neurological symptoms, e.g., Guillain Barre Syndrome (Zhao et al., 2020), suggesting an autoimmune background, which has been associated with MHC alleles (Hasan et al., 2014).
Such aspects should be considered while examining neurological symptoms in patients after COVID-19 recovery, and also in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts.
In order to test this possibility, we analyzed the most frequent MHC class I and II alleles in Europe, Asia, and Africa for binding to the mutations in ORF8 (L84S) and ORF3a (G251V) (see supplementary data sets).
For MHC class I, starting with a peptide with the mutation site in the middle (flanked by seven amino acid residues to the left and right, resulting in a 15mer peptide) for ORF8 (L84S) (GNYTVSCLPFTINCQ and GNYTVSCSPFTINCQ) and for ORF3a (G251V) (VQIHTIDGSSGVVNP and VQIHTIDVSSGVVNP), we tested all possible combinations of length from 8 to 14 residues for MHC class I binding, For MHC class II, starting with a peptide with 33 residues with the mutation site in the middle for ORF8 (L84S) (KSPIQYIDIGNYTVSCL/SPFTINCQEPKLGSLVV) and for ORF3a (G251V) (KIVDEPEEHVQIHTIDG/VSSGVVNPVMEPIYDEP), we tested all possible combinations to bind to MHC class II alleles listed in the supplementary data set since MHC class II molecules can accommodate longer peptides, and nominal epitopes may ‘glide’ within the MHC class II peptide binding cleft (Rammensee, 1995).
We could not identify differences in MHC class I or class II binding characteristics (see Appendix- supplementary data sets Tables S1, S2 and S3) except for three MHC class II alleles, i.e., DRB3*02:02, DRB1*09:01, and DRB1*04:01, that do not allow binding of the wildtype, but accommodate the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 (L84S) variant (Table 1
) and also two MHC class II alleles HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*02:01 that do the opposite: they accommodate the wildtype but not the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 (L84S) variant (Table 1).
Of the 11,970 SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in the GISAID database by April 27th, 2020, 85% exhibit the amino acid Leucine at the position 84 and 15% exhibit Serine.
Genetic factors such as the HLA type of patients may play a role in regard to disease severity and clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent MHC-class I and -II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe.
MHC 4-digit typing along with viral sequence analysis should be considered in studies examining clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
