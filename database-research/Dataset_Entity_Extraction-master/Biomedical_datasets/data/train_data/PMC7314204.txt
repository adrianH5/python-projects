As of 4 April 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1], has infected more than 1.2 million people worldwide and the increase in cases has been exponential.
Viral genomes were aligned using MAFFT v7.427 [6] with 762 high-coverage viral genomes deposited in the GISAID (Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data, recently adapted to include SARS-CoV-2 genomes) database [7, 8] as of March 20, 2020, in addition to the most recent viral genomes sequenced in California as of May 3, 2020 [9], for a total of 983 sequences.
Assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes in this study were uploaded to the GISAID database [7, 8] (accession numbers EPI_ISL_417330, EPI_ISL_417331, EPI_ISL_429881, EPI_ISL_EPI_ISL450232 - EPI_ISL450240) and were also submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (accession numbers MT419851, MT419852, MT419860, MT510718-726).
Raw sequence data were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (BioProject accession number PRJNA629889 and umbrella BioProject accession number PRJNA171119).
Data from these patients with COVID-19 were matched with 102 randomly selected negative controls who were patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 over the same time period.
Among the 46 COVID-19–positive patients, the median age was 44 years, 46% were female, and 65% were outpatients (Supplementary Table 1).
We noted that a travel history within 2 weeks of symptom onset (median date, 11 March 2020) was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8–8.4), comprising 43% (20/46) of newly diagnosed cases (Figure 1A).
Out of the 20 travelers with COVID-19 infection, there were significant associations for prior travel to Europe (5 travelers; OR, 6.1; 95% CI 1.1-32.7), travel outside of San Francisco to other cities within California or other states (United States) (14 travelers; OR: 4.0; 1.6–10.0), and specifically travel to New York (6 travelers; OR, 32.9; 95% CI 1.8-598) as compared with 17 travelers without infection (Figure 1B and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
One cluster of 3 positive cases associated with COVID-19 infection in an airport worker was categorized as a case of community- rather than travel-associated transmission.
No significant associations were found with regard to close contacts with persons with known COVID-19 infection or frontline healthcare workers.
Those who did not have a recent travel history, a close contact who was COVID-19 positive, or were not a frontline healthcare worker were categorized as community transmission with an unknown source of infection and comprised 39% of cases.
We defined genomic clades through the GISAID nomenclature found at that point in time on 20 March 2020 [7, 8].
Real-time dissemination of epidemiological survey data from positive COVID-19 cases is critical to support efforts to contain or reduce spread of viral infection in the community.
Our evaluation of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in San Francisco in early March 2020 associates with travelers from New York prior to the recognized spike in New York cases in late March (Figure 1C).
Travel from New York was underrecognized as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection in the United States in early March.
Guidelines for COVID-19 testing have not included screening for domestic travel.
Cryptogenic transmission of COVID-19 by individuals with mild illness or asymptomatic infection is a tremendous challenge to the containment of COVID-19 [15, 16].
In early-to-mid March 2020, 20 of 46 (43%) COVID-19 cases at a tertiary care hospital in San Francisco, California were travel related.
