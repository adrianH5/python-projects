Some studies listed platelet counting as economic, ubiquitous and ephemeral in discriminating the coronavirus disease (COVID) into severe/moderate as thrombocytopenia is linked to COVID-19 [6].
We have postulated virion propagation and causes of pneumonia in COVID-19.
This, in turn, led to inflammation and loss of platelets via deposition in peripheral microvascular beds, thereby heralding symptom-thrombocytopenia and intravascular coagulopathy in COVID-19.
