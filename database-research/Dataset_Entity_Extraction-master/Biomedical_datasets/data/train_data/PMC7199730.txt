Further extensive global transmission led to the WHO declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11 2020.
There are thousands of global SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences available on the rapid data sharing service hosted by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; https://www.epicov.org)
The extraordinary availability of genomic data during the COVID-19 pandemic has been made possible thanks to a tremendous effort by hundreds of researchers globally depositing SARS-CoV-2 assemblies (Table S1) and the proliferation of close to real time data visualisation and analysis tools including NextStrain (https://nextstrain.org) and CoV-GLUE (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk).
A variant calling pipeline (available at https://github.com/DamienFr/CoV-homoplasy) was used to obtain high-confidence alignments for the 348 (out of 889 as of April 19 2020) SRA genomic datasets both meeting our quality criterions and matching GISAID assemblies.
The topology of the Maximum Likelihood phylogeny of these 348 samples was compared to that of the corresponding samples from the GISAID genome assemblies using a Mantel test and the Phytools R package (Revell, 2012) (Figs. S8-S9, see Supplementary text).
The 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes offer an excellent geographical and temporal coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 1a-b).
Using TreeDater (Volz and Frost, 2017), we observe an estimated tMRCA, which corresponds to the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, of 6 October 2019–11 December 2019 (95% CIs) (Fig. S4).
These dates for the start of the epidemic are in broad agreement with previous estimates performed on smaller subsets of the COVID-19 genomic data using various computational methods (Table 1), though they should still be taken with some caution.
Indeed, the sheer size of the dataset precludes the use of some of the more sophisticated inference methods available.
The SARS-CoV-2 global population has accumulated only moderate genetic diversity at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic with an average pairwise difference of 9.6 SNPs between any two genomes, providing further support for a relatively recent common ancestor.
Indeed, the earliest available strains were collected in Asia, where the COVID-19 pandemic started, followed by extensive genome sequencing efforts first in Europe and then in the USA.
The SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity found in most countries (with sufficient sequences) essentially recapitulates the global diversity of COVID-19 from the 7666-genome dataset.
This is also to an extent the case for Italy (Fig. S2b), which was an early focus of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, this global dataset includes only 35 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Italy, so some of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains in circulation likely remains unsampled.
The genomic diversity of the global SARS-CoV-2 population being recapitulated in multiple countries points to extensive worldwide transmission of COVID-19, likely from extremely early on in the pandemic.
The strongest hit in terms of the inferred minimum number of changes required (Fig. 3b-c) at Orf1ab (11,083, Codon 3606) falls over a region encoding the non-structural protein, Nsp6, and is also observed in our analyses of the SRA dataset (Table S7).
Over the last century alone, several global epidemics have claimed millions of lives, including the 1957/58 influenza A (H2N2) pandemic, the sixth (1899–1923) and seventh ‘El Tor’ cholera pandemic (1961–1975), as well as the HIV/AIDS pandemic (1981-today).
COVID-19 acts as an unwelcome reminder of the major threat that infectious diseases represent in terms of deaths and disruption.
The genetic data available at the time looks staggeringly small in comparison to the amount that has already been generated for SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For example, analyses by multiple independent groups place the start of the COVID-19 pandemic towards the end of 2019 (Table 1).
This site passed our stringent filtering cirteria and was also present in our analysis of the SRA dataset (Table S7).
The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time.
Highlights     •  Phylogenetic estimates support that the COVID-2 pandemic started sometimes around 6 October 2019 – 11 December 2019.    •
