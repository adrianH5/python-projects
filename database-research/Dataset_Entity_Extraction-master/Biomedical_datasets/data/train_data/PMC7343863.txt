Eleven per cent of the participants reported having comorbidities and 36.3% reported having had COVID-19-compatible symptoms in the previous months.
Thirty-nine participants (6.7%) had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by rRT-PCR, of which only one had required hospital admission (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
Around 15% (6/39) of HCW who had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 by rRT-PCR did not show a detectable response of any of the antibody isotypes (Supplementary Table 2).
Twenty per cent (11/54) of seropositive participants did not report COVID-19 compatible symptoms in the previous months.
Around 39% (21/54) of seropositive HCW had never been diagnosed of COVID-19, although 10 of these (47.6%) reported past COVID-19-compatible symptoms.
The odds of being seropositive were higher in participants who reported having had any COVID-19-compatible symptom in the previous months (adjusted OR: 8.8, 95% CI 4.41–17.73, p < 0.0001) (Table 3).
The professional category, working in COVID-19 units, daily contact with patients, close contact with a COVID-19 case, comorbidities or sex, did not show any statistically significant association with presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 2).
IgA levels were higher in participants reporting COVID-19-compatible symptoms in the previous months than in those reporting being asymptomatic (p = 0.041) (Fig. 3c), and among symptomatic individuals, duration of symptoms >10 days was associated with higher IgM levels (p = 0.022) (Fig. 3d).
Among them, 23.1% (15/65) did not report any COVID-19 compatible symptom in the previous months.
Forty per cent (26/65) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, although 12 of them reported COVID-19 compatible symptoms.
Five microliters of RNA solution were added to 15 μl of rRT-PCR master mix (Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit; New England Biolabs) and used for amplification of SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 regions, as well as the human RNase P gene as control, using probes, primers and cycling conditions described in the CDC-006-00019 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases protocol (3/30/2020 release, Supplementary Note 1).
Each batch of RNA extractions and rRT-PCR reactions included three positive controls (EURM-019 single stranded RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 provided by the European Commission Joint Research Centre), 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (IDT integrated technologies, ref. 10006625) and Hs_RPP30 Positive Control (IDT integrated technologies, ref. 10006626), as well as negative controls.
Next, 10 μl of test plasma samples (final dilution 1/500), 10 μl of a positive control (pool of 20 plasmas from subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR, at four dilutions, 1/500, 1/2000, 1/8000 and 1/32000, for QA/QC), and 10 μl of two negative controls (plasmas from European subjects collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, at 1/500), were added per plate.
Sensitivity of the assay using samples from participants previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and with more than 10 days since the onset of symptoms was 97% for IgA and IgG and 75% for IgM, with specificities of 100% for IgG and IgM and 98% for IgA (Supplementary table 4).
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was >0.97 for each of the isotypes using these same samples (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and >0.87 using samples from any participant previously diagnosed with COVID-19 regardless of the time since onset of symptoms (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Among those with evidence of past or current infection, 40.0% (26/65) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19.
Here we report a relatively low seroprevalence of antibodies among HCW at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain.
A large proportion of HCW with past or present infection had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, which calls for active periodic rRT-PCR testing in hospital settings.
