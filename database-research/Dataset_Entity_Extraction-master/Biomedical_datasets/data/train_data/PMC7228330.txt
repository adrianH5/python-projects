On this basis of the structure of 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) of 2019‐nCoV, the joint team integrated the strategy of virtual screening and enzymology test, focused on the drug screening for the marketed drugs, as well as the self‐built “database of high‐yield compounds” and “database of compounds from medicinal plants”, and quickly found 30 kinds of possible treatments for 2019‐nCoV drugs, active natural products, and traditional Chinese medicine.
The research team built the protein structure of 2019‐nCoV PLP by using homology modeling method, defined its drug‐binding pocket, and screened the active molecules from the existing drug compound library of ZINC, the database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products established by their own laboratory by using the computer‐aided structure‐based virtual screening method.
After triphosphate in vivo, it is incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA chain of the virus as a substrate, and then the synthesis of the virus genome is interrupted.
