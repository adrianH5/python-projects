Overall, 37,846 genes targeted by 48,804 probes were analyzed for all samples (Gene Expression Omnibus accession number GSE36961), and 8443 genes (22% of the transcriptome) were expressed differentially between HCM and controls based on a false discovery rate q-value less than 0.05.
Given the current and devastating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (>2.5 million confirmed cases) that has claimed more than 172,000 lives worldwide in less than 4 months (April 21, 2020), it was noteworthy that the most up-regulated gene in HCM samples was ACE2 (3.53-fold; q-value=1.30×10−23).
This viral internalization may result in loss of membrane ACE2 and a subsequent increase in the angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7) ratio, which in turn allows excessive angiotensin II and unopposed angiotensin type 1 receptor–mediated lung injury in patients with COVID-19 infection and the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Nevertheless, widespread ACE2 expression may contribute to the multiorgan dysfunction seen in patients with COVID-19 infection.

The marked 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein in HCM may provide a mechanism to explain higher rates of severe outcomes in COVID-19–infected patients who also have cardiovascular comorbid conditions, as well as the direct cardiac damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Although the incidence of COVID-19 infection seems highest in the elderly or immunocompromised, a large number of affected patients and those requiring hospitalization have significant comorbid conditions, including highly prevalent cardiovascular diseases such as HTN or CHF.
In early studies, 7.2% of all COVID-19–infected patients and 22% of patients admitted to ICUs showed evidence of myocardial injury with elevated high-sensitivity troponin I levels or new ECG abnormalities with clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia or myocarditis.
Although initial reports suggested potentially worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection who were using ACEis,

 a subsequent review article concluded that there was insufficient evidence for this claim, prompting all major cardiac societies to advise that patients with heart disease treated with these medications should continue to use them as prescribed.
Furthermore, a large study among 1128 patients with HTN and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection showed that the unadjusted mortality rate was significantly lower in those for whom HTN was treated with ACEi/ARBs (3.7% vs 9.8%; P=.001).
In light of these findings, a clinical trial has been launched testing the effect of losartan in study-eligible patients with COVID-19 infection (NCT04312009; Figure 4
).
Notably, in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transcript for angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ), a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change, 3.53; q-value =1.30×10 −23 ), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold change, 3.78; P =5.22×10 −4 ), and Western blot confirmed greater than 5-fold overexpression of ACE2 protein (fold change, 5.34; P =1.66×10 −6 ).
However, given that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.
