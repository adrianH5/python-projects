Outbreaks due to members of the coronavirus family have been especially prominent in terms of transmission and mortality, beginning with the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002–2003 [1,2], followed by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [3] and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in late 2019 [4].
The door of development for peptide-based therapeutics was widely opened by introducing peptides with varying sequence length, side-chain reactivity and degree of modification and incorporation of unnatural components.
In the immediate future, repurposed drugs and vaccines will be the first line of defense against COVID-19 [53], however drug resistance and other issues with vaccines (use in immunocompromised or immune deficient individuals) should allow room for development of therapeutics targeting other pathways.
During a disease outbreak/pandemic situation such as COVID-19, researchers are in a prime position to identify and develop peptide-based therapies, which could be more rapidly and cost-effectively advanced into a clinical setting.
Furthermore, we discuss the advantages of peptidomimetics and other potential targets that have been studied using peptide-based therapeutics for COVID-19.
