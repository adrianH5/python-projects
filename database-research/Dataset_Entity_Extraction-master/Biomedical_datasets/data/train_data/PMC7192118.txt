The GenBank accession numbers of these viruses are recorded in Table S1.
Finally, we compared the pan-CoV assay’s performance to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay [11] against a set of clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients.
As the COVID-19 pandemic is currently surging, pathogen discovery of novel CoVs now seems even more important than before.
To assess the assay's clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market.
