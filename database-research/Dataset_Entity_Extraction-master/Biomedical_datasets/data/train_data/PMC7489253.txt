An outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread from China worldwide since December 2019 (Zhu et al., 2020).
Therefore, most COVID-19 patients require hospitalization or isolated observation, but large numbers of patients could overwhelm healthcare systems globally.
It is important for us to avoid an increasing number of COVID-19-related deaths by early detection of the high-risk group.
The inclusion criteria were mild/moderate symptoms of COVID-19 when hospitalized, serum collection on the first day of hospitalization, and serial serum collection during hospitalization.
For a screening experiment, a total of 28 patients with COVID-19 who were eligible based on the study’s criteria participated.
To confirm the discrimination ability of the predictive markers between the COVID-19 severe population and other diseases, 114 patients with several common diseases, who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Supplemental Information and Supplemental Table 3), were enrolled.
However, IP-10, CXCL9, and CCL17 levels were specifically associated with the COVID-19 severe/critical group.
Laboratory data showing significant associations with the development of severe/critical symptoms (Supplemental Table 1) were compared between COVID-19 and common diseases (Supplemental Fig. 2).
The ranges of all laboratory data except for CRP overlapped between COVID-19 and common diseases.
To validate the predictive power of CCL17, independent samples from COVID-19 patients were added, and CCL17 levels at an early phase of hospitalization were determined.
Approximately 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild or moderate disease and recover within a few weeks, but as previously reported, the remaining COVID-19 patients develop severe or critical symptoms (Guan et al., 2020, Wu and McGoogan, 2020).
ALB, LDH, CRP, and neutrophil counts were associated with the development of severe pneumonia (Gong et al., 2020, Mo et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a, Zhang et al., 2020a), and COVID-19 patients with hypertension were also significantly more likely to develop severe disease (Wu et al., 2020).
In COVID-19, the CCL17 expression range was very narrow in the severe/critical group.
This feature might explain why many more children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms than adult patients.
Dysfunction of Treg cells in the lung could induce severe/critical pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
The mechanism of CCL17 suppression in COVID-19 is unknown.
High expression of IP-10 was associated with severe disease in COVID-19 (Ma et al., 2020, Runfeng et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020).
Interestingly, there were no associations for both IFN-λ1 and 2 in COVID-19, and IFN-λ1 or 2 genes were not associated with response to interferon-α (IFN-α) treatment for CHC (Ge et al., 2009).
Therefore, clinical trials of IFN-α treatment for COVID-19 that classified patients by SNP type showed that it could provide good results (Li and De Clercq, 2020, Wang et al., 2020b).
The present data showed for the first time that IFN-λ3 itself is a key molecule for the development of severe pneumonia, and the natural course of IFN-λ3 in COVID-19 patients was shown using serial serum samples.
The association of IL-6 with COVID-19 has been previously reported (Chen et al., 2020a, Gao et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020c).
The present data suggest that COVID-19 patients with RA have high levels of IL-6 without severe/critical symptoms.
These data suggest that the SNP type of individuals should be considered to understand the profiles of predictive markers, in addition to COVID-19 outcomes.
However, Yang et al. reported that CXCL9 levels were elevated during disease progression of COVID-19, but they were not useful as predictive markers (Yang et al., 2020).
Highlights     •  CCL17, IFN- l 3, IL-6, IP-10, and CXCL9 were predictor for COVID-19 prognosis.
The downregulation of CCL17 could be unique in COVID-19.
COVID-19, a novel coronavirus-related illness, has spread worldwide.
Therefore, almost all COVID-19 patients require hospitalization, which can reduce limited medical resources in addition to overwhelming medical facilities.
To identify predictive markers for the development of severe pneumonia, a comprehensive analysis of serum chemokines and cytokines was conducted using serial serum samples from COVID-19 patients.
Low expression of CCL17 was specifically observed in pre-severe COVID-19 patients compared with other common diseases, and the predictive ability of CCL17 was confirmed in validation samples of COVID-19.
