In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and a previously unknown Betacoronavirus was subsequently isolated from patients with pneumonia [1].
In order to effectively control the COVID-19 outbreak, information regarding the period and routes of infectious virus shedding in patients is essential.
In general, droplets and close contact with infected respiratory secretions are considered the main transmission routes of the SARS-CoV-2; however, faecal–oral transmission has also been suggested since some COVID-19 patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, and viral RNA has been detected in oral and anal swabs from patients [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]].
Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from clinical specimens of COVID-19 patients using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
All PCR products regardless of whether ferret or human clinical specimens were sequenced and compared with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_407193).
Their underlying diseases, COVID-19 severity and treatment courses are summarized in Table 1
.
Serum IgG antibody responses of all COVID-19 patients are described in Table 2
.
These symptom-recovered COVID-19 patients (patients 1, 2, 3 and 5) showed positive qPCR results in their urine specimens with viral RNA titres ranging from 1.08 ± 0.16 to 2.09 ± 0.85 log10 copies/mL. Further, in faecal specimens from patients 2, 4 and 5 (n = 3) SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected at 1.17 ± 0.32, 2.18 ± 0.11 log10 copies/mL and 2.01 ± 0.28 log10 copies/mL, respectively.
In this study, we found that viable SARS-CoV-2 can be shed through various clinical specimens, such as saliva, stool and urine, of COVID-19 patients even at 15 days after onset of clinical symptoms.
In addition, we demonstrated the infectivity of saliva, urine and stool specimens from COVID-19 patients using cell culture and an animal model.
Given the consistent detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from saliva in another study [14], saliva could be an important non-invasive specimen for diagnosis and virus isolation in COVID-19 patients.
However, despite several attempts [[18], [19], [20]], only one study thus far has demonstrated the presence of the infectious virus in faecal specimens from COVID-19 patients during the reviewing process for this study [18].
The aim was to determine whether various clinical specimens obtained from COVID-19 patients contain the infectious virus.
To demonstrate whether various clinical specimens contain the viable virus, we collected naso/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva, urine and stool samples from five COVID-19 patients and performed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess viral load.
Further, viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva of COVID-19 patients, as well as nasal washes of ferrets inoculated with patient urine or stool.
Discussion  Viable SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in saliva, urine and stool samples from COVID-19 patients up to days 11–15 of the clinical course.
