5 days post transduction, mice were infected via the intranasal route with a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) at 1.5×105 TCID50·mL−1 of MERS-CoV EMC/2012. 50 mg·kg−1·day−1 CsA diluted in DMSO or DMSO alone were mixed with a nut/chocolate cream, and offered to the mice for voluntary uptake.
Oral application of CsA significantly reduced viral titres (3.45±0.15 versus 2.1±0.36 TCID50·mL−1 in the DMSO versus CsA group) at day 7 post MERS-CoV infection (figure 7c).
Oral application of CsA (50 mg·kg−1·day−1) or DMSO as solvent control was started at day 3 post transduction, while mice were infected with 1.5×105 TCID50·mL−1 MERS-CoV via the intranasal route at day 5 post transduction.
Lung homogenate was used to b) quantify relative IFNL2/3 mRNA and c) determine viral load by TCID50.
TCID50: 50% tissue culture infective dose.
