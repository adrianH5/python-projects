Currently, nucleic-acid based tests have been widely used as the reference method for the diagnosis of COVID-19.[7]
The pandemic of COVID-19 was first discovered by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in which the novel virus was found to be a new pathogenic member of the betacoronavirus genus but shared only about 79% in genetic similarity with SARS-CoV.[8, 9]
A tool kit of rapid diagnostics faster than typical RT-PCR is in great demand to circumvent the bottlenecks in assay turnaround time and reagent supply for COVID-19 testing.
Among the 61 suspected COVID-19 specimens, we were able to confirm 52 cases with read numbers mapping to the novel virus across 6 orders of magnitudes (median read of 1,484, from 2 to 19,016,501).
Among these, the set that targeted Orf1ab showed the best overall performance of sensitivity and specificity, and therefore, was used to develop CRISPR-COVID in this study for further evaluation (S2A, S2B and S2C Fig).
As shown in Fig 2B, CRISPR-COVID consistently detected 7.5 copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2 in all 10 replicates, 2.5 copies/reaction in 6 out of 10, and 1.25 copies/reaction in 2 out of 10 runs.
These data indicate that CRISPR-COVID had a near single-copy sensitivity.
To confirm its specificity, we tested CRISPR-COVID with DNA from human cells as well as a panel of microbes including i) bacteria commonly found in respiratory infections: S. pneumonia, H. influenza, M. pneumonia, C. pneumonia, B. pertusiss; ii) human Coronaviruses: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E; iii) other viruses commonly found in respiratory infections: Adenovirus Type-3, H. Influenza B (Victoria), H influenza A (H3N2), HPIV-1, RSV-A; and iii) other bacteria: S. mitis, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. coli, E. facecaiis.
Altogether, these analytical assessments suggest CRISPR-COVID as a promising molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection with great sensitivity and specificity.
Upon completion of the analytical assessment, we further evaluated the diagnostic potential of CRIPSR-COVID in clinical specimens.
A total of 114 RNA samples from clinical respiratory samples were included in the evaluation, which consisted of 61 suspected COVID-19 cases (among which 52 confirmed and 9 ruled-out by mNGS), 17 SARS-CoV-2-/hCoV+ cases and 36 samples from healthy subjects (Fig 3A).
When conducting the CRISPR-COVID assay, a positive control (PC) DNA and a no-template control (NC) were included in parallel for each run.
CRISPR-COVID demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% by detecting all 52 COVID-19 cases.
No false positives were found in all 62 negative cases, including all the hCoV-infected ones (Fig 3B), suggesting promising clinical sensitivity and specificity of CRISPR-COVID.
To further evaluate assay compatibility, the primer and gRNA sequences used in CRISPR-COVID were aligned to 2,439 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from public databases.
As these genomes covered wide ranges of collection times (from 2019/12/24 to 2020/05/06) and geographic locations (over 20 countries including China, United States and France etc.), our results suggest the general applicability of our assay for COVID-19 diagnosis.
Using mNGS and the PCR as the reference, CRISPR-COVID had a specificity of 100% in our study.
PCR-COVID was able to detect the virus in 90.4% (47/52) of the positive cases, with Ct’s ranging from 28.8 to 40.4 and a median Ct of 35.8.
It’s worth noting that the 5 false negative samples by PCR-COVID had a median mNGS read number of 550, which was much lower than that of the other positive samples at 2,381 reads, suggesting a lower titer of the virus in these samples.
CRISPR showed a greater sensitivity by detecting all 52 COVID-19 cases (100%), with FC values ranging from 5.0 to 66.3 and a median FC of 22.8 (Fig 3C).
When the reaction turn-around time (TAT) is compared, the CRISPR-COVID reaction requires only 40 minutes, which is the least among the three and includes 30 minutes of DNA amplification and 10 minutes of Cas reaction.
PCR-COVID requires about 1.5 hours for a completion run of the PCR program.
As showed in Fig 4, CRISPR-COVID presented a significant advantage in effective TAT over PCR and mNGS.
Recent progresses in molecular diagnostic technologies, especially mNGS, allowed rapid, initial identification of this novel pathogenic agent at the beginning of the current COVID-19 pandemic.[8]
However, the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 created a dramatic burden not only on the society, but also on public health.
The surging demand for rapid screening and identification of COVID-19 posts a great challenge on the diagnostics.[21]
An RT-PCR assay for COVID-19 is faster and more affordable.
As we demonstrated in this study, CRISPR-COVID was able to deliver comparable sensitivity and specificity as mNGS within as short as 40 minutes.
At research scale, the material costs of a CRISPR-COVID test runs at less than $3.5, which could be dramatically reduced at production scale to below $0.7[23], suggesting CRISPR-COVID as a competitive alternative not only technologically but also financially.
RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 were performed using a clinically validated kit approved by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (Liferiver, Shanghai, China) on a ABI-7500 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) according to the instructions, with Ct values below 40 considered positive.
Clean reads were aligned against the reference microbial databases including archaea, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses.
The CRISPR-COVID test combines an Reverse-transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) step and a following T7 transcription and Cas13 detection step as described previously. [17]
In this study, we developed an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for COVID-19 with near single-copy sensitivity.
The recently discovered betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that rapidly developed into a global pandemic.
The surging demand for rapid screening and identification of COVID-19 posts great diagnostic challenges.
Here, we harnessed the unique collateral activity of programmable CRISPR/Cas13a to develop CRISPR-COVID, a rapid and sensitive diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and compared it to sequencing-based metagenomic and RT-PCR-based assays in a clinical cohort.
CRISPR-COVID demonstrated a sensitivity level of near single copy and was highly specific without cross reacting to related pathogens.
CRISPR-COVID takes only 40 mins and requires no sophiscated thermo-cyclers, providing a valuable alternative to the conventional RT–PCR assay to circumvent the bottlenecks in assay turnaround time, equipment and reagent supplies for COVID-19 testing.
