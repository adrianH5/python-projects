The emergence of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus-mediated disease 2019, or COVID-19, has now spread pandemically, resulting in a serious global health crisis.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from England (hCoV-19/England/20136087804/2020|EPI_ISL_420910, no treatment) and Turkey (hCoV-19/Turkey/GLAB-CoV008/2020) were obtained from the China National Bioinformatics Center, GISAID database [23] (https://www.gisaid.org).
DianaTools miRPath V3 were then used to create heat maps for pathways affected by selected miRs, focusing on the microT-CDS version 5.0 database.
The data have been deposited with links to BioProject accession number PRJNA615032 in the NCBI BioProject database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/).
Several database sources were referenced for enrichment analysis, including Interpro [32], NCBI [33], MSigDB [34,35], REACTOME [36], and WikiPathways [37].
The miRBase online database holds 2565 miR sequences and from these we identified regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, which showed high similarity to human miRs.
The selected intersected pathways were analyzed as significant targets as p value 0.05 with threshold value 0.8 and Fisher’s Exact Test (hypergeometric distribution) calculations by miRPath version 3.0 in the microT-CDS database.
Using the GISAID database, we analysed a sample of viral genomic sequences from several geographical areas for mutations in the potential miR sequences (n = 28–133).
In addition, miR-8066 is found to be associated with one of the critical clinical problems of COVID-19, the cytokine storm, owing to its potential effect on the cytokine-cytokine receptor pathway.
Briefly, the downregulation of host cell responses’ related pathway members such as SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane, L13a-mediated translational silencing of ceruloplasmin expression antigen processing, ribosomal organization, and the ERAD pathway, were observed in COVID-19-positive lung biopsy specimens.
miR-5197-3p was identified as the most effective miR to interact with the guide RNA of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19 [49].
According to the Harvard and MD Anderson databases, miR-5197 shows significant differences between Caucasians and Chinese populations (data gained from a Han Chinese cohort from Nanjing, China) [50].
Because of its potential presence in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cellular responses, we have analysed data from the lung tissue biopsy database (PRJNA615032 Bioproject) to understand its function.
Opioids have furthermore been shown to enhance simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) in rhesus monkeys [68], while reduced clearance of pulmonary influenza virus infection was observed in morphine-treated Lewis rats [69].
In AIDS, malabsorption of vitamin 12 has been related to gastric secretory failure, including chronic diarrhoea, due to advanced HIV infection [87,88].
Also, vitamin B3 was found to be highly effective to help lung tissue damage repair [92] and it was suggested to be given to COVID-19 patients as soon as the CT lung abnormalities were detected [93].
Sudden cardiac death is a major problem amongst the unexplained deaths in COVID-19, and it has been identified that many of those patients suffered from primary myocardial fibrosis (PMF), without any known aetiology.
Recently, higher expression of miR-1468-3p was identified as a disease-associated and age-dependent cardiac biomarker, as it promotes cardiac fibrosis and cell senescence, although no difference was noted in the mature form of miR-1468 between healthy and COVID-19-diseased cardiac tissue [101].
In our study, analysis of several SARS-CoV-19 genomes, which were isolated from different geographical regions, shows significant similarity scores with human miRs, which target a subset of genes related to pathways affecting virus pathogenicity and host responses observed in COVID-19 patients.
In our current study we identified that seven completely complementary miRNAs of COVID-19 (cc-miRc) prevent viral replication and protein translation processes.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the betacoronavirus family, which causes COVID-19 disease.
Based on our reported findings, miRNAs may constitute potential and effective therapeutic approaches in COVID-19 and its pathological consequences.
