The pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the RNA coronavirus SARS-CoV2 has spread over 200 countries and infected millions of people worldwide [1,2].
The rapid spread of COVID-19 across various countries opens an intriguing question whether the variations in genome sequences of the novel coronavirus are contributing to the variation of infection and mortality rate [5,6].
Having this question in mind, with the reference to the Wuhan based genome NC_045512, missense mutations were identified in the SARS-CoV2 genomes of the COVID-19 affected Indian patients.
This study of mutations in the SARS-CoV2 genomes of 128 COVID-19 affected Indian patients has been carried out.
The following Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5
adumbrate all the missense mutations along with silent mutations across the 128 virus genomes from Indian COVID-19 affected patients.
This may suggest that designing a therapeutic approach against ORF6, ORF10 and E genes may have a beneficial effect in controlling COVID-19 pandemic especially in India.
