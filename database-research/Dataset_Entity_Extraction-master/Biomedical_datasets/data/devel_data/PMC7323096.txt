We read with great interest the review by Khan et al
 who discussed the emerging role of cardiovascular disease and the progression of the novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19).
We commend their conclusions that appropriate triage and risk stratification is essential in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVID‐19.
RAAS inhibitors contributing to increased severity of COVID‐19, most commonly in hypertension, is a logical hypothesis due to their mode of action.
Early observational studies concluded that the use of RAAS inhibitors may not be associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or more severe COVID‐19 progression.
One retrospective multicentre study with 1128 participants (188 on a RAAS inhibitor) suggested that in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients with pre‐existing hypertension, RAAS inhibitors had better outcomes compared to non‐RAAS inhibitor use.
It is pivotal further preclinical studies are carried out to understand the cardiovascular mechanisms in COVID‐19.
