The number and proportion of persons infected with COVID-19 are mainly determined based on individual testing and laboratory-based bio-molecular diagnostics using, e.g., reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
COVID-19 cases are reported by regional health authorities and aggregated on the level of, e.g., the Federal States in Germany, as well as on a national level (RKI, 2020).
Medema et al. (2020) have shown a good correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and the gene concentration in the wastewater of different Dutch cities.
Sequences were identified in terms of the closest homology sequence using BLAST, https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi (database Nucleotide collection (nr/nt) using Blastn (optimized for somewhat similar sequences) or Megablast (optimized for highly similar sequences)).
In Germany, local health authorities report the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed by laboratory diagnosis after aggregation from the community to district level to state and federal authorities.
Whenever available, the cumulative prevalence and the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients recovered and deceased were obtained from community-level reports published on the homepages of the responsible local health authorities on April 9th, 2020.
Previous evaluation of the primers and probe within a different test setting analysing patient material or cell culture-derived SARS-CoV-2 showed minor cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses (data not shown).
While the sequence of the P12 PCR product showed significant similarity to SARS-CoV-2 sequence (isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA-CZB-1525/2020; Accession: MT628199.1) confirming the positive identification of human SARS-CoV2 by means of RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A), no match to SARS-CoV-2 was detectable for C2 (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
In addition, a positive BLAST result for C4 with SARS-CoV-2 synthetic construct (accession: MT458696.1) (E value 0.002) (Supplementary Fig. S1C) was found.
When sequencing the different PCR amplicons obtained using wastewater samples taken during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and long before the outbreak (retained samples), distinct results for the test sample (P12) which fits SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA-CZB-1525/2020 isolate from NCBI database was found, but not for the retained samples suggesting an unspecific signal in RT-qPCR, respectively.
On the day of our sampling campaign, we estimate the nominal acute incidence of COVID-19 to range between 30 and 174 cases per 100,000 residents in the nine catchment areas studied (Table 4).
The nine catchment areas studied differ considerably in size, wastewater flow (Table 2), and nominal numbers of COVID-19 cases at the day of sampling ranging from 36 to 1037 acute cases and from 85 to 1924 cumulative cases (Table 4).
Clearly, the estimated nominal number of COVID-19 cases increases with increasing measured SARS-CoV-2 load, resulting in correlations both for cumulative and acute prevalence (Fig. 8A and B).
