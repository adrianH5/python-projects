Afterwards, the disease was named “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)” by the World Health Organization (WHO) [4].
GnomAD database analysis revealed that these identified ACE2 variants are reported with a cumulative frequency of 0.2289 in ethnically matched populations (EUR).
However, this variant deserves further investigation in a larger COVID-19 cohorts as well as functional studies.
The missense variant c.2158A>G p.(Asn720Asp) was found in two patients, one female in heterozygous state and one male, with a frequency in line with our Italian control population and with the frequency reported for the European non-Finnish population in the GnomAD database.
We tested the hypothesis if these variants were associated with COVID-19 severity.
For this reason, we wanted to analyze in detail the genetic variability of ACE2 in our population, among the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Until now, most available published studies were carried out on an epidemiological basis of population allele frequencies deposited in the various available databases.
We identified in a single COVID-19 patient a variant (p.Asp630His), very rare in European population and not detected in our Italian control population.
Interestingly very recently, Bunyavanich et al. [19] showed age-dependent expression of ACE2 gene in nasal epithelium, highlighting that the different levels of ACE2 expression may be the reason for a lower incidence of COVID-19 in children.
Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS-CoV ), the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in a cohort of 131 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 and in an Italian control population, to evaluate a possible allelic association with COVID-19, by direct DNA analysis.
As a pilot study, we analyzed, by whole-exome sequencing, genetic variants of ACE2 gene in 131 DNA samples of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tor Vergata University Hospital and at Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital, Rome.
Therefore, further studies are needed in larger cohorts, since it was found only in one heterozygous COVID-19 patient.
Our results suggest that there is no strong evidence, in our cohort, of consistent association of ACE2 variants with COVID-19 severity.
