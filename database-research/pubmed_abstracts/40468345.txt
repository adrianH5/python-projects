Soft-tissue reconstruction is crucial in fields such as plastic surgery and oncology to address the repair of damaged tissues.
Knitted scaffolds from bioresorbable copolymers, specifically poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL), offer mechanical and biological properties that are essential for tissue engineering.
This study assessed three-dimensional knitted scaffolds fabricated from melt-spun PLA and PCL multifilaments for soft tissue engineering applications.
It examined the impact of the PLA/PCL ratio on the knitted scaffold structure, mechanical properties, and biological responses to determine the optimal composition for adipose tissue reconstruction.
