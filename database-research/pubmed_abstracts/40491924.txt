Macrophage activation is closely associated with Acute pancreatitis (AP).
We screened and found that Growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2) is highly expressed in macrophages during AP.
However, the relationship between Grb2 and AP is still poorly understood.
In this study, we explored the role of Grb2 in AP.
