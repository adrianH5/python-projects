Syringaresinol (SYR) is a dietary lignan largely known for its therapeutic effects.
Thus, our present review provides an overview of the natural sources and chemistry of this molecule and discusses its biological and pharmacological properties.
Indeed, SYR is widely distributed in the plant kingdom and has been reported in 87 species distributed over 40 families.
Its main sources are Acanthopanax and Albizia genera.
It has also been identified and purified from Cinnamomum cassia and Panax ginseng C.A.
Mey.
Interestingly, SYR has an important anti-inflammatory effect and is implicated in multiple mechanistic pathways, including the inhibition of iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and the decrease of NF-κB, nitric oxide (NO), PGE2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-6 levels.
In cancer treatment, SYR induces cell cycle arrest, increases the expression of p21
