Bladder cancer (BLCA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are two prevalent diseases that may share molecular mechanisms, suggesting potential links between metabolic disorders and cancer.
Using bioinformatics approaches, we integrated multiple databases to identify common genes between BLCA and DM, screening for potential biomarkers.
CXCL12 (C-X-C motif chemokine 12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 ,Â SDF-1) was ultimately identified as a key gene, followed by comprehensive analyses including immune infiltration analysis, functional enrichment analysis, survival analysis, clinicopathological correlation analysis, TIDE immune prediction scoring, and immunophenoscore (IPS) scoring comparison.
The results indicate that CXCL12 is associated with altered immune cell function and tumor characteristics under elevated blood glucose levels, influencing the tumor microenvironment and promoting disease progression.
The results elucidate the molecular underpinnings of BLCA and DM, establishing a basis for subsequent investigations into common mechanisms and the formulation of targeted therapeutic approaches.
Research on shared biomarkers, such as CXCL12, between metabolic diseases and tumors aids in the precise prevention and control of comorbidities' adverse effects on tumor progression.
This approach significantly reduces the health burden linked to comorbidities.
