Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an epithelial fragility disease primarily affecting the skin and caused by variants in the COL7A1 gene.
Individuals with RDEB are predisposed to develop highly aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) which represent the most common cause of premature death.
There is a lack of effective prevention or treatment options for patients with RDEB-SCC.
