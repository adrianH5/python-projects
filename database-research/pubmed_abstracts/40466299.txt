Polysaccharides are one of the main active components of Polygonatum hunanense (PHP).
This study extracted polysaccharides from the roots of PHP using water extraction and ethanol precipitation methods.
Additionally, PHP was isolated and purified through various techniques, particularly through Diethylaminoethyl-52 (DEAE-52) cellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatography columns.
Structural analysis revealed that PHP is composed of 94.9 % fructose and 5.1 % glucose, with a molecular weight of 6.01 kDa.
Moreover, the main chain of PHP residues linkage was found to be β-D-Fruf-(2 → 6)-D-Glcp-(1 → 2)-β-D-Fruf-(6,1 → 2)-β-D-Fruf-(1 → 2)-β-D-Fruf.
Branch chain analysis revealed the presence of →2)-β-D-Fruf-(1, 6 → 2)-β-D-Fruf-(1 → 2)-β-D-Fruf.
Subsequently, PHP was chemically modified, yielding acetylated polysaccharides (Ac-PHP) and sulfated polysaccharides (Su-PHP).
The identification results from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and
