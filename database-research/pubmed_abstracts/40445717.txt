Cells rely on substrate adhesion to activate diverse signaling pathways essential for proliferation and survival.
In the absence of proper adhesion to extracellular matrix, cells undergo anoikis, a form of programmed cell death.
Poorly attached cells often exhibit rounded morphology and form dynamic protrusions called blebs.
While the role of blebs in amoeboid migration is well-documented, recent studies have highlighted their role in anoikis resistance.
However, little is known about whether the most abundant membrane components-phospholipids- function in blebs-facilitated anoikis resistance.
Here, we report an enrichment of PI(3,4,5)P
