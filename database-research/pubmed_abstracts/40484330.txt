Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies among men, with a staggering 1.5 million new cases and 350,000 deaths reported globally in 2022.
Conventional treatment methods, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and hormonal therapy, often encounter significant challenges such as systemic toxicity and diminished efficacy, particularly in the advanced stages of the disease.
Treatment of prostate cancer remains a formidable challenge because of the poor water solubility of many chemotherapeutic agents, which severely limits their bioavailability.
However, the rise of targeted therapies has catalyzed the development of innovative drug delivery systems designed to enhance the bioavailability and precision of therapeutic agents.
Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are a promising solution that can effectively encapsulate chemotherapeutic agents and genetic materials.
Their unique attributes, such as biocompatibility, controlled release profile, and customizable surface properties, make them advantageous alternatives to conventional treatment strategies, effectively addressing the inherent limitations of prostate cancer therapy.
