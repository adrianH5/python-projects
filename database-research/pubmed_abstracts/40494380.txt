It is rare to observe I-131 accumulation in the gallbladder and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
We report a case of a 69-year-old woman with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), who received radioactive I-131 therapy (RAIT) after total thyroidectomy and radical right neck dissection.
Whole-body scan (WBS) after the RAIT showed that there were 2 abnormally intense foci in the right abdomen.
SEPCT/CT showed that they were in the gallbladder and the caudate lobe of the liver.
Biopsy of the caudate lobe revealed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
