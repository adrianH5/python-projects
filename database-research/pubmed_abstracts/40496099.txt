Palliative care aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for patients with life-limiting illnesses through effective pain management with opioids.
Despite its global importance, opioid use in palliative care faces significant challenges, particularly in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh.
In Bangladesh, opioid use is notably low, with disparities between urban and rural areas.
Cultural stigmas, strict regulations, and inadequate healthcare provider training further obstruct effective pain management.
