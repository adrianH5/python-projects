As the sixth most common cancer in the world, the development of gastric cancer (GC) is influenced by many factors.
Recent studies have revealed a strong association between dyslipidaemia and GC.
In this paper, the relationships between dyslipidaemia and GC are discussed in depth.
We review the development of GC through the mechanisms of the inflammatory response, signalling pathways, and apolipoprotein function, and the intersecting targets of atherosclerosis and GC are explored.
The synergistic effects of Helicobacter pylori infection and dyslipidaemia on the development of GC are also analysed, and the potential value of statins in the prevention and treatment of GC is discussed.
In this review, we systematically investigated the relationship between dyslipidaemia and GC to provide new ideas for GC prevention and treatment.
