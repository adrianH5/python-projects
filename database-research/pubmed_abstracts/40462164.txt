Novel diagnostic criteria for glioblastoma (GBM) in the 2021 WHO classification emphasize the importance of integrating pathological and molecular features.
Pathomics, which involves the extraction of digital pathology data, is gaining significant interest in the field of tumor research.
This study aimed to construct and validate a nomogram based on machine-learning pathomics for patients with GBM.
