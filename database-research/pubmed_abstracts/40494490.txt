Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a histone demethylase with a crucial role in cancer initiation and progression.
Several LSD1 inhibitors and degraders are undergoing clinical trials.
Metabolic reprogramming, a key hallmark of cancer cells, allows them to survive in harsh environments.
Studies have highlighted the roles of epigenetic regulators, particularly LSD1, in modulating metabolic pathways to promote cancer cell growth, metastasis, and invasion.
In this review, we highlight the roles of glucose, glutamine (Gln), and fatty acid (FA) metabolism in tumor cells, as well as the signaling pathways through which LSD1 regulates these metabolic processes, aiming to provide new insights and strategies for cancer treatment.
