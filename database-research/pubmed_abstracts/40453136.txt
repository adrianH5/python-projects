Most myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) risk stratification models dichotomize conventional cytogenetic abnormalities into present or absent, neglecting the prognostic impact of clone size (percentage of the total cells/metaphases harboring the chromosome abnormality).
We investigated the prognostic value of clone size in 1001 patients with MDS using G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Clone size correlated with anemia severity and thrombocytosis in del(5q) cases, and with anemia and blast percentage in complex karyotypes.
