During the last decades, sedentary behaviour has been recognised as an interdependent risk factor for cardiometabolic health and premature mortality.
Prolonged sedentary behaviour is associated with increased risks for chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, chronic respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and cancer due to disturbances in cardiometabolic health.
However, despite the increased evidence supporting these associations, the underlying molecular mechanisms to the development of these NCDs remain largely unknown.
In this review, we therefore discuss the existing evidence with regard to the potential underlying molecular mechanisms of sedentary behaviour-induced perturbations in cardiometabolic health.
Here, various potential mechanisms related to carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation and micro- and macro vascular function will be outlined.
In addition, we summarise the current evidence on various strategies to interrupt sedentary behaviour and their effects on cardiometabolic health outcomes, including insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profiles, and cardiovascular health.
Finally, we highlight key research gaps in the field of sedentary behaviour in relation to the underlying molecular mechanisms.
