Diagnosing early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, particularly high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PanIN), remains challenging.
Serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytologic examination (SPACE) using an endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, but its application in surgically altered anatomy is technically demanding.
We present a case in which balloon enteroscopy-assisted SPACE led to the diagnosis of HG-PanIN and successful resection.
