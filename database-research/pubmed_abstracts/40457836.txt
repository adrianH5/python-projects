In this issue, Li and colleagues characterize the mutational changes that accompany skin carcinogenesis in the two-stage model in mice.
They demonstrate that, despite inducing thousands of mutations that can persist for almost a lifetime, mutagen-induced initiation must be followed by non-mutagenic promotion, which presumably alters tissue landscapes to mediate clonal selection for malignant phenotypes.
