Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) of neoplastic origin is a rare but life-threatening cause of bleeding.
Endoscopic treatment is challenging due to diffuse oozing blood and high rates of rebleeding, despite coagulation and hemoclip use.
Hemostatic powders can be an option in those patients.
We aimed to determine the initial hemostatic rate and the rebleeding rate at 7 and 30 days, using hemostatic powders in patients with malignant UGIB at a national referral center in Mexico.
