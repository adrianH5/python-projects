Central venous access for cancer chemotherapy is crucial for patients undergoing long-term treatment.
The internal jugular vein (IJV) and subclavian vein (SCV) are commonly used for implantable port insertion, though the optimal choice remains debated.
This meta-analysis aims to compare the safety and effectiveness of IJV and SCV for central venous implantable port insertion in cancer chemotherapy patients based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
