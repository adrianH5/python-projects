Clay minerals serve as both excipients and active ingredients in pharmaceutical formulations.
Due to their swelling capacity and colloidal properties, they are also promising candidates for use in controlled drug release.
Besides clay materials, chitosan also plays a crucial role in biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability.
By using montmorillonite and halloysite as case examples, this review provides valuable insights into the distinctive characteristics of clay materials, exploring the potential use of their nanocomposites formed with chitosan in drug delivery.
It first outlines the fundamental properties of clay materials, followed by a discussion of key fabrication methods for chitosan/clay nanocomposites.
Finally, recent advances in the development of carriers based on chitosan/clay nanocomposites and their pharmaceutical performance are discussed.
Directions for future research are also highlighted.
It is hoped that this article could provide a snapshot of the current understanding of the properties and use of chitosan/clay nanocomposites as drug carriers and offer insights into the future potential of clay mineral hybrids in pharmaceutical applications.
