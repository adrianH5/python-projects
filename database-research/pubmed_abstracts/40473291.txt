Treatment of the node negative contralateral neck in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) remains debated, with no clear consensus.
Prophylactic contralateral neck treatment (either surgically or via irradiation) is generally recommended when the estimated risk of occult nodal metastasis is >20%.
Unfortunately, patients undergoing bilateral neck treatment often require long-term supportive care for swallowing dysfunction.
Reducing the impact of treatment on long-term quality of life is key in patients with OPC who have a good prognosis and tend to be young and fit at presentation.
Lymphatic mapping and the use of free-hand single photon emission CT (fhSPECT) combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy is a novel approach to address this clinical need.
The Lymphatic mapping Of Oropharyngeal Cancer trial aims to (a) validate a lymphatic mapping protocol in OPC using new technology (fhSPECT) with radiotracers and (b) establish lymphatic drainage patterns and the occult metastatic rate in the contralateral neck in OPC.
