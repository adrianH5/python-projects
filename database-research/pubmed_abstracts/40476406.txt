INNOVATIONS IN RADIOTHERAPY.
Radiation therapy is a cornerstone in cancer management, used in over 50% of patients.
Major innovations in radiotherapy, transform it into an increasingly precise and personalized treatment modality.
Emerging indications, such as oligometastatic disease and reirradiation, benefit from advanced techniques like intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic radiotherapy.
Image-guided technologies, including next-generation CBCT and MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT), enable daily adaptive treatment planning and better management of anatomical variations.
Additionally, techniques like deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) and respiratory tracking enhance treatment precision for mobile tumors.
These advancements significantly reduce toxicities while improving treatment efficacy.
They represent a pivotal step in the evolution of cancer care, highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration to optimize patient outcomes.
As radiotherapy continues to evolve, these innovations pave the way for more effective and safer treatments, redefining standards.
