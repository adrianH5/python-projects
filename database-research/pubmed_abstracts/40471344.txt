Over 8 million patients experiencing cancer face health-related social needs (HRSN) challenges, such as food, housing, and financial insecurity, that directly impact their health outcomes.
While patients may participate in the screening of unmet social needs with their healthcareÂ provider, it is not well understood if patients will self-screen and act on referrals to community services.
Therefore, we conducted a mixed-methods study in which we pilot-tested a patient-centered oncology-focused digital social care referral platform, ConnectedNest.
