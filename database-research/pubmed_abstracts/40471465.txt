Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive malignancy associated with early recurrence, metastatic propensity, and poor clinical outcomes, yet its underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated.
This study aims to investigate the role of glutamate in promoting macrophage polarization and TNBC progression via the IRE1Î±/XBP-1 signaling pathway.
