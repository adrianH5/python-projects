Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of malignant neoplasm and is the primary cause of mortality among women aged 45 to 55 years.
Studies indicate that cancer displays irregular metabolic patterns in contrast to normal tissue.
Furthermore, there is compelling evidence supporting the significant role of peroxisomes in the intricate metabolic processes of cancer.
Peroxisomal biogenesis factors (PEXs), which are peroxisomal proteins, control activities such as the degradation and biogenesis of peroxisomes.
Hence, the correlation between peroxisomal biogenesis factor expression and BC was explored, to introduce key proteins and potential biomarkers by analyzing.
