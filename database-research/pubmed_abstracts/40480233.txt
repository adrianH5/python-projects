Recently, a copper-dependent form of cell death called cuproptosis has been described, distinct from apoptosis, ferroptosis, and other known pathways.
Cuproptosis is defined by excessive copper binding to lipoylated proteins, causing their aggregation and leading to cell death.
Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding cuproptosis, focusing on its molecular mechanisms, physiological regulators, and therapeutic potential in cancer.
