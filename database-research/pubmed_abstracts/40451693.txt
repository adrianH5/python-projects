Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most frequent primary liver cancer.
The involvement of Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) in tumor advancement is well-documented.
However, its function in ICC is not fully understood.
This study aimed to explore the function and regulatory mechanism of YBX1 in ICC and provide evidence for YBX1 as a potential new approach for immunotherapy in ICC.
