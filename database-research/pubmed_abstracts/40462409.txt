Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects over one third of the global population and is closely linked to gastrointestinal, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases.
As the most common cause of steatotic liver disease (SLD), MASLD is often referred to as "fatty liver" in general health information searches.
With the Internet becoming a primary source of healthcare information, this study aimed to evaluate global and regional public interest in steatotic liver disease using Google Trends data from January 2004 to December 2024.
