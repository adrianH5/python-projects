Clinical guidelines recommend discussing infertility risk and referral to fertility preservation (FP) specialists in all patients facing cancer treatment, including children.
We sought to determine whether sociodemographic or clinical factors led to differences in referral and utilization of FP services at a children's hospital with a formal FP program.
We hypothesized that sociodemographic differences would exist in FP utilization, but not in referral rates.
