The adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) pathotype is implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis.
AIEC strains are currently defined by phenotypic measurement of their pathogenicity, including invasion of epithelial cells.
This broad definition, combined with the genetic diversity of AIEC across patients with IBD, has complicated the identification of virulence determinants.
We sought to quantify the invasion phenotype of clinical isolates from patients with IBD and identify the genetic basis for their invasion into epithelial cells.
