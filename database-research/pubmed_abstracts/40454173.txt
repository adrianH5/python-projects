Infectious ecthyma is a severe and highly contagious disease caused by ORF virus (ORFV).
The virus is responsible for significant economic losses in the goat industry and threatens humans.
Regarding complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP), we previously showed that C1QBP can interact with ORFV129.
However, the role of C1QBP in regulating the apoptosis of goat fetal turbinate cells is unknown.
