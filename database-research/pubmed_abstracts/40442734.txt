A wide range of pain management techniques have been investigated following pelvic tumor resection and reconstruction surgery; however, the optimal components remain a subject of debate.
In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we assessed the postoperative analgesic efficacy of integrating lateral quadratus lumborum block (Lateral-QLB) and anterior quadratus lumborum block (Anterior-QLB) with multimodal analgesia (MMA) regimen, compared to MMA regimen alone, in patients undergoing pelvic tumor resection and reconstruction.
