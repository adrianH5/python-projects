Liver regeneration is a critical adaptive response to hepatic injury, requiring precise metabolic reprogramming to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating hepatocytes.
While the oncoprotein Gankyrin is well-established as a promoter of liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, its role in metabolic adaptations underlying liver regeneration remains unclear.
In this study, we demonstrate that Gankyrin deficiency in the liver (
