Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can have a major influence on patient outcomes, but their usage is frequently confounded by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which have revolutionized cancer treatment by increasing anti-tumor immunity.
With a focus on immunological dysregulation and the resulting tissue-specific toxicities, this review clarifies the fundamental processes of irAEs.
We look at contemporary clinical treatment techniques to lessen the impact of these adverse events, such as the application of immunosuppressants and patient monitoring procedures.
Additionally, it is emphasized how future research is necessary to find predictive biomarkers that can forecast the development of irAEs, allowing for early intervention and individualized therapy methods.
In order to improve the therapeutic index of ICIs, we also examine the crucial balance between optimizing anti-tumor activity and reducing immunotoxicity.
This study aims to further the existing discussion on enhancing the safety and effectiveness of ICI medicines, which will eventually improve cancer patient care, by pointing out possible research avenues.
