Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the digestive tract, which has the characteristics of high morbidity and mortality.
However, gastric cancer is not achieved overnight but is gradually developing through the interaction of many factors.
Therefore, actively delaying or blocking the &quot;inflammation-cancer&quot; transformation in gastric mucosa is the key to treatment.
Nod-like receptor protein 3(NLRP3) inflammasome is a multi-protein signal complex and one of the important innate immune signal receptors.
Inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer, and continuous inflammation mediation will trigger the transformation from inflammation to cancer.
Therefore, the significance of NLRP3 inflammasome to gastric mucosa lies in the transformation between inflammation and cancer.
Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has the functions of multi-components, multi-targets, and few adverse reactions.
A large number of studies show that TCM and related monomers have significant effects in treating liver, kidney, and immune diseases through mediating NLRP3 inflammasome, but there is less research on the &quot;inflammation-cancer&quot; transformation in gastric mucosa.
By combing the NLRP3-related nuclear factor-κB transcription factor(NF-κB), hypoxia inducible factor-1α(HIF-1α), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B(PI3K/Akt), and other signal pathways, this paper clarified their mechanisms in the &quot;inflammation-cancer&quot; transformation in gastric mucosa, delayed the process of &quot;inflammation-cancer&quot; transformation in gastric mucosa through four aspects: energy metabolism, pyroptosis, immune response, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and prevented and treated &quot;inflammation-cancer&quot; transformation in gastric mucosa from three aspects: TCM monomer, TCM compound prescription, and other therapies, so as to provide ideas for the subsequent treatment of &quot;inflammation-cancer&quot; transformation in gastric mucosa with TCM.
