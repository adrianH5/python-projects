Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most prevalent cancers among women globally.
The primary cause of CC is persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV16, whose E7 oncoprotein plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis and the maintenance of stem cell-like characteristics.
RTKN2 participates in the progression of various cancers.
However, the precise functions of RTKN2 in regulating CC remain unclear.
The effects of HPV16 E7 in CC cells were evaluated using MTT, western blotting, Transwell, and sphere formation assays.
Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify the targets of HPV16 E7.
The expression levels of the target (RTKN2) in clinical samples were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC).
The function and mechanism of RTKN2 in CC cells were investigated by the knockdown and overexpression approaches, as well as dual-luciferase reporter assay.
HPV16 E7 exhibited a positive correlation on the malignant phenotype and stemness of CC cells.
RTKN2 was identified as a target of HPV16 E7, and a reduction in its expression levels was caused by knockdown of HPV16 E7.
The high expression of RTKN2 was associated with a poor prognosis in CC.
HPV16 E7 may regulate RTKN2 expression by modulating the binding activity of E2F1 to the RTKN2 promoter.
Upregulated RTKN2 activates the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, enhances the stemness of CC cells, and ultimately promotes malignant progression.
