The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as neoadjuvant therapies for locally advanced and resectable non-small cell lung cancer is increasing.
As a result, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) may be observed before surgery and may require preoperative intervention.
We report the case of a patient with destructive thyroiditis induced by neoadjuvant ICI treatment, in which surgical resection was performed after steroid treatment.
