A 90-year-old man presented with persistent chest and hip pain for 2 months.
Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI showed significant enlarged rectal mass and multiple osteolytic lesions.
An initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma with bone metastasis was made.
However, biopsy of the lesion confirmed prostate acinar carcinoma.
A 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT indicated mildly PSMA avid lesions after 3 months of androgen deprivation treatment.
This case highlights the potential for prostate cancer to present with similar image features of other malignancies on anatomical imaging modalities, posing a diagnostic challenge.
