Sarcopenia describes the process of progressive, generalised loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, and has been recognised as a predictor of postoperative complications and mortality.
Prehabilitation represents a clinical strategy where patients undergo both physical and psychological strategies in order to improve their functional capacity prior to surgery.
Importantly, prehabilitation programs have been considered as an area of perioperative optimisation to address sarcopenia.
However, the optimal prehabilitation program regimen remains poorly characterised.
Instead of suggesting a novel prehabilitation strategy for sarcopenic patients, this review seeks to characterise the best-practice modalities and methods of resistance training as a component of multimodal prehabilitation to improve patient outcomes following surgery.
