Â The prevalence of metastatic bone disease as well as the accompanying societal costs are expected to increase due to advances in cancer treatment.
While the literature suggests that there is economic value in prophylactic stabilization compared with the fixation of completed pathological fractures in long bone metastases, studies are limited by their small sample sizes and insufficient correction for potential confounders.
We aimed to evaluate whether prophylactic treatment of an impending femur fracture was associated with lower healthcare costs compared with completed pathologic fractures.
We further aimed to compare prophylactic surgical treatment with completed pathological fractures in terms of postoperative complications, discharge disposition, and postoperative length of stay.
