Therapeutic landscape of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has transformed over the last 2 decades, particularly with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).
While ICI offer therapeutic benefits, they can also provoke immune-related adverse events (iRAEs).
Vasculitis as a clinical iRAE from ICI is rare in association with RCC treatment.
