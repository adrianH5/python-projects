Chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidative immunotherapy is the standard-of-care for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), yet confers limited benefit in those with driver mutations, BRAF-V600x included.
Here, we report two cases of unresectable stage III NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation treated with induction dabrafenib, trametinib, and a PD-1 inhibitor.
Both patients exhibited significant tumor regression, enabling surgical conversion and achieving pathological complete or major response, without significant adverse events.
These cases suggest that targeted-immunotherapy combinations may present a promising treatment option for tumor downstaging and surgical conversion in unresectable stage III NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation.
However, prospective studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up are warranted to validate this strategy.
