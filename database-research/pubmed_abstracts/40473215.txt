RAS mutations are observed in 20% of all cancers, with the KRAS isoform highly mutated in colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancers.
The last several years have seen the development of clinical compounds that target KRAS G12C mutations, with other compounds under clinical development.
In this study, a series of KRAS small-molecule inhibitors were compared for their binding affinity against a panel of KRAS mutant alleles.
These inhibitors either covalently target the G12C mutant or reversibly target other mutants by binding in a transient pocket known as the switch-II pocket.
Covalent inhibitors bound KRAS-GDP with K
