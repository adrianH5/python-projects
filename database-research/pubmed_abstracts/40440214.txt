This paper highlights the urgent need to update randomized controlled trial reporting guidelines to include consistent and detailed data on subsequent treatments, particularly in oncology, where postprogression therapies significantly influence overall survival and cost‐effectiveness assessments.
Drawing on our experience as an External Assessment Group and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Committee members, a systematic review of renal cell carcinoma trials and broader regulatory guidance, we advocate for standardized reporting of subsequent treatment types, timing, and durations to enhance the reliability of health technology assessments and support more informed decision‐making.
