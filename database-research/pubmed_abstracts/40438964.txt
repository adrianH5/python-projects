MicroRNA (miRNA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (miRNA-SNPs) have been associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
However, since the results of these individual studies have been inconsistent, we performed a meta-analysis to help establish a statistical significance for the association between miRNA-SNPs and pediatric ALL risk.
We also analyzed whether they confer susceptibility across country-specific studies by using different genetic models.
