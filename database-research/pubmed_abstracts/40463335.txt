A six-membered benzene ring is fused with a five-membered imidazole ring at positions four and five, generating benzimidazole, the benzo derivative of imidazole and a bicyclic aromatic chemical compound.
Benzimidazole is a significant pharmacophore in a variety of physiologically active heterocyclic compounds due to its distinctive characteristics and structural framework.
Because benzimidazole is both aromatic and heterocyclic, it interacts with a range of biological targets
