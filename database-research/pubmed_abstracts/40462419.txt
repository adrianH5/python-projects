The measurement of urinary catecholamines and total metanephrines serves as one of the primary tests in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL).
The widely adopted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, however, typically necessitates sample pretreatments and chromatographic separation prior to MS, resulting in challenges for facile and rapid screening of targets from complex matrices.
Therefore, it is crucial to develop an analytical method that can rapidly and efficiently detect urinary catecholamines and total metanephrines.
