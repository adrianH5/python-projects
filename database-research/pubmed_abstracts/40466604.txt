Pyroptosis and cuproptosis are promising strategies in cancer therapy.
However, strategies to induce cell pyroptosis and cuproptosis are limited by the tumor microenvironment (TME).
In this study, a multifunctional copper-based composite nanomaterial (CCS-ICG) was developed to enhance antitumor efficacy through a synergistic combination of chemodynamic therapy (CDT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT), alongside ion interference.
This nanomaterial integrates endogenous and exogenous stimulation mechanisms to promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
Upon entering tumor cells, CCS-ICG decomposes to release H
