As a member of the family of the YTH domain and a an m6A reader, YTHDF3 is implicated in cancer and inflammatory diseases.
However, its function in ankylosing spondylitis (AS)-a chronic inflammatory disease marked by aberrant bone formation-is still mysterious.
The research set out to study how YTHDF3 may promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in AS and delineate the underlying mechanism.
