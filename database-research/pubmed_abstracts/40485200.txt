PurposeTwenty percent of childhood cancer survivors experience physical function impairments, and âˆ¼75% develop a chronic health condition.
Physical and occupational therapists (PT/OTs) can mitigate these late effects, yet few children receive cancer rehabilitation (CR).
This research aimed to identify provider attitudes and perspectives towards CR services for children across inpatient and outpatient settings at a cancer center.MethodsThree cardiac rehabilitation instruments were adapted to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding CR delivery.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant survey results.ResultsTwenty administrators, 20 physicians/advanced practice providers (APPs), and 20 PT/OTs completed surveys.
All disciplines strongly agreed on the value of CR for patient outcomes and care quality.
Barriers to CR access included insurance models that disincentivize healthcare systems from providing CR, lack of a standardized screening and referral process, and inconsistent patient participation.
Physicians/APPs (81%) endorsed clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to promote CR referrals, and 90% of PT/OTs agreed hybrid CR delivery, which includes both supervised and unsupervised exercise, would increase patient participation.ConclusionThis study identified opportunities to increase CR access for childhood cancer survivors, including CPGs, streamlining referral processes, hybrid CR delivery, and closing insurance gaps.
Future research should address these factors to improve CR access and ultimately improve outcomes for pediatric survivors.
