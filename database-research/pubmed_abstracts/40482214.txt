An increasing number of Medicare beneficiaries with cancer report Medicare Advantage (MA) coverage, but certain features of MA (eg, utilization management) may impede access to cancer care.
MA beneficiaries may desire to switch to traditional Medicare (TM), which imposes little to no utilization restrictions, but switching may be challenging because access to Medigap-providing financial protections against high cost sharing in TM-is limited by medical underwriting of beneficiaries applying after initial Medicare enrollment in most states.
