Smoking is closely linked to pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other health issues, posing a significant threat to human health.
The essence of smoking addiction lies in nicotine dependence, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
Previous studies have suggested that nicotine addiction is associated with regions such as the insula, globus pallidus, amygdala, and ventral striatum.
However, our prior retrospective study indicates that the dorsal striatum may also play a role in nicotine addiction.
