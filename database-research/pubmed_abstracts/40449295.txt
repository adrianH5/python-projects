Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide.
Olive oil, rich in monounsaturated fats and polyphenols, has been linked to a reduced BC risk, but epidemiological evidence remains limited.
This study examined the association between olive oil consumption and BC risk in a large cohort of adult Italian women and conducted a systematic review on this association.
