Recent studies suggest standard reference intervals for serum free light chains (FLC) are inaccurate and that this problem can only be partially remedied by using separate reference intervals for individuals with impaired kidney function.
This decreases the utility of FLC testing in the clinical evaluation and follow-up of plasma cell disorders, particularly affecting the diagnosis of light chain (LC) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).
