Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a great challenge to public health worldwide and also increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC).
Natural killer (NK) cells serve as the first line of defense in the host's innate immune system, performing natural killing functions and mediating cytotoxicity against tumors and viruses.
Therefore, a better understanding of NK cell cytotoxicity may facilitate the development of treatment strategies for CRC-associated with COVID-19.
