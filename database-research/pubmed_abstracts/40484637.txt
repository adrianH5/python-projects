The da Vinci SP, a robotic surgical platform capable of single-port surgery, offers cosmetic advantages; however, its use in pediatric patients has been limited.
This report presents the first da Vinci SP operation for a choledochal cyst in a 7-year-old girl with Type Ic disease.
The procedure was completed in 300 min, including 192 min of console time, with no intraoperative complications.
Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7.
The SP robot enables precise surgical interventions within small anatomical spaces without the need for extensive planning of port placement to avoid forceps interference.
Additionally, its ability to adjust the position of the remote center expands the potential for a wide range of pediatric operations, particularly for surgeries in close proximity to target organs.
