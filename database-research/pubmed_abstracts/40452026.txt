Limited metastatic gastric cancer (lmGC) represents an intermediate disease stage, positioned between localized and widely disseminated gastric cancer, and has garnered increasing attention due to its distinct prognostic outcomes.
Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment approach for lmGC, raising the question of whether it should align more with the systemic treatment-focused approach used for metastatic gastric cancer or adopt a surgery-centric strategy similar to that used in localized disease.
Previous studies have preliminarily explored combining systemic treatment and surgical resection to address both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions.
However, these investigations have been constrained by limited evidence and yielded inconclusive findings.
