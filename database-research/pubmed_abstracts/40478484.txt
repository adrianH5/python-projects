Significant advances have been made in image-based determinations of future remnant liver function, in attempts to better predict post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF).
We have reported time-associated liver functional assessments using magnetic resonance imaging with liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio increasing rate (LSRi) and LSRi of the future remnant liver region (LSRi-rem) to predict PHLF.
This study aimed to investigate the predictability of PHLF by a preoperative liver function assessment index that combined LSRi-rem and future remnant liver volume (FRLV).
