Therapeutic gene expression can address many of the challenges associated with the controlled delivery of intracellularly active biologics, such as enzymes that degrade RAS for the treatment of RAS-driven cancers.
Here, we demonstrate that an optimized synthetic nonviral gene delivery platform composed of poly(ethylene glycol)-
