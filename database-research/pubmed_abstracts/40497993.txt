The rising incidence of colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis underscores an urgent need for regenerative solutions to address functional deficits after colectomy.
However, the creation of clinically applicable large intestine scaffolds remains underdeveloped.
Here, we report the successful generation and thorough characterisation of transplantable-sized porcine large intestinal scaffolds via perfusion decellularisation.
This method effectively preserved extracellular matrix (ECM) structural and biochemical integrity while minimising immunogenicity through cellular component removal.
Crucially, native vasculature remained intact, confirmed by histology, DNA quantification, and high-resolution CT angiography.
Despite efficient decellularisation, challenges including residual nucleic acids, ECM heterogeneity, and partial microvascular occlusion were noted, echoing ongoing limitations in engineered, perfusable, full-thickness scaffolds.
In vivo implantation demonstrated favourable biocompatibility and host integration; however, thrombosis occurred due to the lack of pre-seeded cells, emphasising the necessity of recellularisation for functional perfusion prior to implantation.
This study addresses significant field limitations, presenting the first reproducible approach for structurally intact, perfusable, full-thickness large intestinal scaffolds of transplantable dimensions.
Our innovations offer a strong foundation for future integration of patient-derived cells, stem cells, and organoids, progressing toward clinically viable, scalable, tissue-engineered large intestine constructs, from xenogeneic sources, relevant for regenerative medicine, disease modelling, and pharmacological screening.
