Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with postoperative recurrence and metastasis being major challenges despite advancements in surgical intervention.
Current prognostic tools primarily rely on histopathological staging and tumor biomarkers, which lack dynamic monitoring capabilities for postsurgical outcomes.
Emerging evidence highlights the roles of soluble E-cadherin (sEC) and soluble endoglin (s-CD105) in tumor progression: sEC reflects epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor invasiveness, while s-CD105 correlates with angiogenesis.
However, limited studies have jointly evaluated their predictive value in postoperative breast cancer patients.
