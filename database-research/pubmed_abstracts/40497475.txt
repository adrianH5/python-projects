Field cancerization (FC) refers to spatially distributed premalignant tissue changes that lead to the appearance of local malignancy, and its detection can improve cancer screening.
In this work, we employ combined Raman and partial wave spectroscopy (RS-PWS) to detect FC in gastroesophageal (L2-IL1B) and intestinal (Villin-Cre, Apc
