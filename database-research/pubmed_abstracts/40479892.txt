Inflammatory programmed cell death mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation is one of the most representative forms of pyroptosis, involving multiple autoinflammatory diseases.
In this investigation, we report the discovery of 3-pyridazinesulfonyl derivatives as a new class of inhibitors against NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis.
We initially performed a phenotypic screening against NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis and discovered compound 1 (Hit-1), which showed moderate anti-pyroptotic activity (EC
