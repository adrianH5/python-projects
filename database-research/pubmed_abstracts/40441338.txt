Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer death in women, yet LC screening (LCS) rates remain low.
Identifying LCS eligible women who are undergoing screening mammography has been shown to increase LCS in this population.
We aim to evaluate the proximity of mammography facilities to LCS facilities to further leverage screening mammography (SM) on a national level to increase LCS uptake among women.
