Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α) is a major transcriptional factor regulating gene expression under hypoxic conditions.
HIF-1α expression was closely correlated with the oxygenation status of tumor and could serve as an important biomarker for tumor hypoxia, aggressiveness, or radiation resistance.
High expression of HIF-1α contributes to high aggressiveness or poor prognosis of endometrial cancer.
