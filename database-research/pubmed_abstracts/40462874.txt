Colorectal cancer is a leading global health concern, with significant physical and psychosocial impacts on patients.
Many CRC patients undergo colostomy procedures, which can lead to lifestyle changes and an increased risk of depression.
Social isolation, a detachment from social networks, has been linked to depression in various chronic illnesses but remains underexplored in this specific patient group.
This study aims to investigate the association between social isolation and depressive symptoms in patients with colorectal cancer following colostomy.
