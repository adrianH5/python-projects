Hepatitis B virus infection remains a pervasive global health challenge, affecting an estimated 254 million people worldwide.
This review summarizes the current landscape of hepatitis B, including its epidemiology and the clinical spectrum of acute and chronic infection.
It discusses the interplay between host and virus that underlies the progression from acute hepatitis to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
The review further examines current screening practices, diagnostic methods, and staging tools, as well as providing an in-depth evaluation of antiviral treatment strategies guided by randomized clinical trials and international consensus.
Particular emphasis is placed on emerging therapeutic approaches.
Drawing on high quality evidence from large scale epidemiological studies, rigorous clinical trials, and evolving global guidelines, this review not only encapsulates the state of the art in the management of hepatitis B but also highlights critical gaps and future directions.
This synthesis is intended to inform clinicians and researchers alike, offering insights that may enhance patient care and guide future research toward the ultimate goal of elimination of hepatitis B.
