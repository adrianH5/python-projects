Congenital myopathies are a group of neuromuscular disorders that typically present at birth or early childhood with hypotonia and non-progressive or slowly progressive muscle weakness.
They are classically subclassified by characteristic structural changes and histopathological findings in skeletal muscle.
Variants in over 40 genes have been described to date in patients with various forms of congenital myopathy with overlapping phenotypic and histological features, which poses a challenge for laboratories and clinicians in interpreting genetic findings.
