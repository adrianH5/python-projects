Advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits weak responses to multiple therapies, primarily due to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which drive high recurrence rates, metastasis, and drug resistance.
We have previously systematically conducted CSC-targeted compound discovery and evaluation studies to inhibit CSC-mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis.
Here, we identified ZSH-512, a novel synthetic retinoid that selectively targets retinoic acid receptor (RAR)Î³, demonstrating its ability to effectively inhibit CRC-CSCs and patient-derived organoids (PDOs)
