The U.S. healthcare system faces a critical shortage of allied health professionals, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce retirement.
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) has developed the Student Talent Advancing Retention Success (STARS) program to mitigate the impact of the shortage.
In this study, we discussed a graduate workforce retention model that involves the collaboration between the School of Health Professions and the Division of Diagnostic Operations at the MDACC.
The program is designed to address the challenge of a shortage of radiologic technologists workforce and to support the institution's strategic vision for geographic expansion.
The STARS program targets shortages in medical imaging specialties like radiologic technology, MRI, CT, and interventional radiology.
The primary objective of the STARS program is to enhance the resilience of MD Anderson's patient access to imaging services, ultimately contributing to overall organizational improvements.
The STARS program achieved a 100% graduate retention rate and significant return on investment (ROI).
Retention of the program participants yielded cost savings for the department by contributing to the elimination of the recruitment fees paid to employment agencies for hiring new technologists, decreased orientation time, and reduced overtime payments to technologists for shift coverage.
This partnership model demonstrates a sustainable workforce development approach in healthcare.
Integrating academic and clinical operations provides a replicable model for addressing healthcare staffing and workforce development challenges.
