Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy demonstrates favorable survival outcomes and high pathological complete response (pCR) rates, but its efficacy in resectable N1/N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unproven.
Additionally, predictive biomarkers for treatment efficacy and the relationship between lymph node status post-neoadjuvant therapy and survival are unclear.
This prospective study evaluates the efficacy and safety of combining penpulimab with chemotherapy for resectable N1/N2 NSCLC.
