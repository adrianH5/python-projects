Intra-tumor heterogeneity impacts disease progression and therapeutic resistance but remains poorly characterized by conventional histologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular approaches.
Single-cell biophysical properties distinguish functional phenotypes complementary to these approaches, providing additional insight into cellular diversity.
Here we link both buoyant mass and stiffness to gene expression to identify clinically relevant phenotypes within primary mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells, employing MCL as a model of biological and clinical diversity in human cancer.
Linked measurements reveal that buoyant mass and stiffness characterize B-cell development states from na√Øve to plasma cell and correlate with expression of oncogenic B-cell receptor signaling genes such as
