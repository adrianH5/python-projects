Pancreatic hepatoid carcinoma (PHC) is a rare and poorly characterized malignancy, with approximately 50 reported cases in the literature.
Pure PHC, which lacks any features of adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine differentiation, is a subset of this population and is extremely rare.
Data on its management and genomic findings are limited, and further characterization may provide helpful information in caring for these patients.
