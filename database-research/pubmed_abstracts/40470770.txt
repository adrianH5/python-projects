The introduction of novel therapies in multiple myeloma (MM) has significantly improved survival rates.
However, their immunosuppressive nature predisposes patients to serious opportunistic infections, including visceral leishmaniasis (VL).
Due to the rarity of VL in MM patients, specific management guidelines are lacking, and treatments are often extrapolated from those used for HIV-infected patients.
This study aims to provide insights into the management of VL in MM patients.
