γδ T cells have emerged as pivotal regulators within the breast cancer tumour microenvironment (TME) and represent a promising therapeutic strategy for late-stage and metastatic breast cancer.
In recent years, our research has focused on leveraging allogeneic Vγ9Vδ2 T cells as a novel approach to treat advanced cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
However, the varying clinical outcomes of this therapy have prompted us to investigate the diverse roles of γδ T cells within the TNBC microenvironment and to explore strategies for enhancing therapeutic efficacy through microenvironmental remodelling.
