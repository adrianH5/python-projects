Radiation and medical oncology face pressure from payment changes, which aim to increase the value of care and curb rising spending.
Multiple models have been proposed or implemented, with mixed results for cost saving and financial stability.
While previous studies have quantified changes in Medicare reimbursement for radiation oncology on a per-code basis, this has not been done in medical oncology to our knowledge, and no direct comparisons have been made between oncology subspecialties at this level.
Our study aims to quantify and analyze Medicare reimbursement changes for medical and radiation oncology billing codes.
