Lymph nodes are critical immune system components, filtering harmful substances and acting as indicators in various disease states, including cancer.
Accurate differentiation between benign and malignant superficial lymph nodes is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning.
However, conventional diagnostic methods often lack the required precision.
High-frequency contrast-enhanced ultrasound (H-CEUS) offers improved temporal resolution and visualization of microvascular structures, potentially providing better diagnostic accuracy than standard contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).
