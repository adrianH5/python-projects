Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most lethal malignancies and has a dismal prognosis.
However, advances in diagnostic modalities and better multidisciplinary management have contributed to improved survival in these patients.
Of late, various recurrence patterns have been observed; the most common of them being distant metastasis followed by the pancreatic bed and lymph node recurrence.
Recurrence in the remnant pancreas is on the rise due to improved survival in patients who previously underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer.
Total remnant pancreatectomy is an appealing option in resectable remnant pancreatic carcinoma without distant metastasis.
It is an entity showing an increasing incidence and demanding further in-depth studies to elucidate the exact pathological mechanism and to establish appropriate management protocols.
