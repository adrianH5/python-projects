Bone metastases develop in 50-70% of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), with around one-third having bone as only site of distant disease (bone-only [BO]).
Standard imaging is frequently insufficient to track bone metastases.
Evidence suggests that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tumor fraction (TF) is prognostic in MBC.
We hypothesized that TF would be detectable and prognostic for BO-MBC.
