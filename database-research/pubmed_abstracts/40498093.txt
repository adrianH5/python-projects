Drug resistance in cancer cells is a significant challenge for modern oncology, demanding the development of novel therapeutic techniques.
This review examines new approaches to reducing drug resistance in cancer cells, with an emphasis on developing therapeutic options.
Complex molecular findings into medication resistance in this article discuss genetic mutations, efflux pumps, altered signaling pathways, and micro environmental impacts.
Targeted medicines, combination therapy, immunotherapies, and precision medicine methods are discussed as promising options.
Combining standard cytotoxic medicines with molecularly targeted inhibitors results in synergistic effects.
The routes used to avoid resistance are investigated.
This article examines how immunotherapeutic approaches like immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies can improve anti-tumor immune responses and overcome immune evasion mechanisms.
Biomarker-driven techniques are crucial for predicting and monitoring therapy responses, leading to improved therapeutic results.
This review examines the impact of medication resistance on cancer therapy paradigms and their potential future direction.
Integrating developing therapeutic options can address problems and improve patient outcomes.
