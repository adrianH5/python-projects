Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare but significant health concern, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer cases.
Despite its low incidence, it presents unique clinical, genetic, and psychosocial challenges.
Genetic predispositions, including BRCA2 mutations and hormonal imbalances, are key factors influencing the development of MBC.
However, the rarity of the condition has led to limited research and fewer treatment guidelines specifically for male patients.
