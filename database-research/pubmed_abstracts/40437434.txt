Radiotherapy (RT) is a key component in the multimodal treatment approach for head and neck cancer (HNC).
Post-therapeutic surgical and/or dental interventions on the jawbone carry a risk of developing osteoradionecrosis (ORN).
To mitigate this risk, dental examinations and, if necessary, treatment should be conducted prior to RT.
However, the consistent implementation of these recommendations in routine dental practice remains uncertain.
This study aimed to evaluate whether insured persons of AOK Saxony-Anhalt (AOK ST) utilise dental services in accordance with current treatment recommendations and whether this behaviour influences the need for post-therapeutic tooth removal and the occurrence of ORN.
