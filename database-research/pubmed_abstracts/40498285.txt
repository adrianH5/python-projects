Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mainly includes lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, and its extremely high morbidity and mortality are the main causes of poor prognosis in NSCLC patients.
Therefore, it is particularly important to study the mechanisms associated with tumor proliferation and metastasis and explore new molecular targets of NSCLC.
Studies have shown that Guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS) may serve as a potential drug target, but its biological function and molecular mechanism in NSCLC are still unknown.
Therefore, it is urgently needed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of GMPS.
