Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is an extremely metastatic cancer with limited available treatment and poor outcomes.
Connexin43 (Cx43) is frequently overactivated and positively correlated with tumorigenesis in many cancers, including breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, but its role in LUSC remains elusive.
In this study, we demonstrated that Cx43 was highly expressed in LUSC tissues as compared to matching normal lung tissues (n = 103) and negatively related to prognosis.
Through the 3D spheroid cell invasion assay, zCDX (zebrafish cell line-derived xenograft), and orthotopic lung cancer xenograft model, we further revealed that Cx43 promotes LUSC invasion and migration via forming GJIC.
Knockdown of Cx43 reduced the Ca
