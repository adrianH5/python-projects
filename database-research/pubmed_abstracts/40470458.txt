Aim The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the modified triple-staple technique in anterior resection for colorectal cancer patients and Hartmann's reversal surgeries done by a single surgeon.
We hypothesized that by using this technique and omitting the purse-string suture, we could reduce operative time and enhance ergonomic benefits.
The study was conducted in accordance with local clinical governance unit protocols and adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Cohort Studies in Surgery (STROCSS) guidelines.
Methods This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate patients who underwent colorectal anastomosis as part of either Hartmann's reversal or colorectal cancer surgeries over a 15-year period, from January 2010 to January 2025.
A total of 132 patients who underwent anterior resection for colorectal cancer or Hartmann's reversal were included.
A modified triple staple technique for end-to-end colorectal and coloanal anastomosis was performed without the use of a purse-string suture on both the proximal and distal segments.
The safety and efficacy of this technique were assessed by monitoring complication rates, including intraoperative complications, anastomotic leaks, and strictures.
Results There were no major intraoperative complications reported.
Anastomotic leakage occurred in 11 patients (8%), while strictures developed in 2 patients (2%).
Postoperative abdominal collections were observed in three patients (2%), and postoperative ileus occurred in nine patients (7%).
Conclusion The modified triple stapler technique for end-to-end anastomosis offers a safeÂ and effective alternative to the conventional purse-string double stapler technique.
