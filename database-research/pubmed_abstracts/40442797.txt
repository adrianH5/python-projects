Oral bacteria have been associated with several systemic diseases, and studies have highlighted their potential role in carcinogenesis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathogen spectrum and antimicrobial resistance rates of clinical isolates from head and neck infections in the Hungarian population.
