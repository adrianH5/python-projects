Bladder cancer (BC) poses a significant health challenge in Egypt, constituting 16% of male cancers and resulting in over 7,900 deaths annually.
Globally, BC stands as the tenth most prevalent cancer with an anticipated 72.8% rise in new cases by 2040.
As BC is an important health problem, early detection and prevention are crucial for improving outcomes.
This could be done by increasing the disease's awareness through structured campaigns for the community, increasing their insights about the risk factors of the disease; most commonly, smoking as well as other risk factors as exposure to certain chemicals, alcohol consumption, diet, obesity and schistosomiasis.
The awareness includes not only the risk factors but also the most common early symptoms for detection.
