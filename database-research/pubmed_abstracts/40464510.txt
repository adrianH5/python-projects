Endometriosis (EM) is a prevalent gynecological disorder in women.
Although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, EM may be related to oxidative stress.
The current research aimed to identify possible pathways that control oxidative stress in EM, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for its clinical diagnosis and treatment.
