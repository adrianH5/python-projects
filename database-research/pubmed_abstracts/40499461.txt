Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a critical challenge in managing cancer patients receiving polytherapy, often due to comorbid conditions.
DDIs can arise through pharmacokinetic mechanisms, affecting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion, or through pharmacodynamic interactions, altering drug target binding or leading to overlapping toxicities.
These interactions can compromise treatment efficacy, exacerbate adverse events, and increase patient morbidity and mortality.
