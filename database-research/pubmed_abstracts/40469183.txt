Combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with chemotherapy (PIC) is a standard first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
The addition of bevacizumab to this regimen (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors+bevacizumab+chemotherapy [PIBC]) remains controversial regarding its potential to enhance antitumor efficacy in clinical practice.
This meta-analysis aims to compare the antitumor effectiveness and safety profiles of PIBC with PIC.
