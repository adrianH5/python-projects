Alcohol-induced blackouts (AIBs) are common in college students and are associated with other alcohol-related consequences.
Alcohol-nicotine co-use is also common in this population.
Nicotine has cognitive-enhancing properties impacting multiple cognitive domains, including those impaired by alcohol (e.g., attention), but it is unclear whether nicotine affects AIB risk or the relationship between AIBs and other alcohol-related consequences.
