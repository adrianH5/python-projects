Comorbid depression and poor performance status are associated with increased mortality and reduced quality of life in patients with advanced cancer.
Coping strategies based on "proactive positivity" may facilitate adaptation to functional decline and limited life expectancy.
However, few studies have examined the impact of the interaction between depressive symptoms and coping strategies on survival outcomes in this population.
This study investigated the associations of 1-year survival with the interaction between comorbid depression and proactive coping strategies, and performance status, in patients with advanced cancer.
