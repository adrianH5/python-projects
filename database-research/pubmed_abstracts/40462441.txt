Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world and its continued use in agriculture and other scenarios is the focus of intense public and scientific interest.
Glyphosate is also controversial in that it was declared 'probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A)' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015.
However, since that time, regulatory agencies in many countries have reviewed the public literature and guideline studies submitted for regulatory purposes and have concluded that it is not a carcinogen.
The acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and the reference dose (RfD) have been revised and restrictions on use have been lifted in many locations.
Risk assessment for any pesticide requires information on exposure in humans and the environment and this was reviewed in 2016 and in 2020.
Since 2020 many studies have been published in the literature and by government departments.
Most of these studies have focused on exposures of the general population, which is the subject of this paper.
Based on the studies published since 2020, the overall conclusion is that exposure of applicators and the general population to glyphosate represents a de minimis risk.
In addition, a general observation from the larger population-based studies that conduct routine sampling is that exposures have declined somewhat since 2020.
