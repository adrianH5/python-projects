&#xD;To develop motion-resolved volumetric MRI with 1.1mm isotropic resolution and scan times <5 minutes using a combination of 3D radial kooshball acquisition and spatial-temporal deep learning 4D reconstruction for free-breathing high-definition lung MRI.
&#xD;Approach: &#xD;Free-breathing lung MRI was conducted on eight healthy volunteers and ten patients with lung tumors on a 3T MRI scanner using a 3D radial kooshball sequence with half-spoke (ultrashort echo time, UTE, TE=0.12ms) and full-spoke (T1-weighted, TE=1.55ms) acquisitions.
Data were motion-sorted using amplitude-binning on a respiratory motion signal.
Two high-definition Movienet (HD-Movienet) deep learning models were proposed to reconstruct 3D radial kooshball data: slice-by-slice reconstruction in the coronal orientation using 2D convolutional kernels (2D-based HD-Movienet) and reconstruction on blocks of eight coronal slices using 3D convolutional kernels (3D-based HD-Movienet).
Two applications were considered: (a) anatomical imaging at expiration and inspiration with four motion states and a scan time of 2 minutes, and (b) dynamic motion imaging with 10 motion states and a scan time of 4 minutes.
The training was performed using XD-GRASP 4D images reconstructed from 4.5-minute and 6.5-minute acquisitions as references.
&#xD;Main Results: &#xD;2D-based HD-Movienet achieved a reconstruction time of <6 seconds, significantly faster than the iterative XD-GRASP reconstruction (>10 minutes with GPU optimization) while maintaining comparable image quality to XD-GRASP with two extra minutes of scan time.
The 3D-based HD-Movienet improved reconstruction quality at the expense of longer reconstruction times (<11 seconds).
&#xD;Significance: &#xD;HD-Movienet demonstrates the feasibility of motion-resolved 4D MRI with isotropic 1.1mm resolution and scan times of only 2 minutes for four motion states and 4 minutes for 10 motion states, marking a significant advancement in clinical free-breathing lung MRI.
