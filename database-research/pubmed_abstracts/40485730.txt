Leptin, a key adipokine secreted by adipose tissue (AT), has emerged as a critical mediator linking obesity and breast cancer, both of which are major global health concerns.
Elevated leptin levels are detected in the circulation and in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by adipose tissue, particularly in cases of obesity.
These leptin-enriched EVs have been implicated in various stages of tumor progression.
In this study, we investigated the effects of leptin within extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by obese adipose tissue on the functional properties and metabolism of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, a model for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
