Hollow mesoporous manganese (HMM)-based nanocarriers, incorporating nanoparticle cavities and mesoporous channels, enhance the photostability and photobleaching resistance of indocyanine green (ICG).
The addition of H2N-c(RGDfK)-OH (RGD) ensures precise targeting, making the cRGD&PEG2000-HMM@ICG (R&P-M@ICG) nanoprobe ideal for NIR-II fluorescence image-guided surgery and photothermal therapy (PTT).
This approach offers accurate targeting, high therapeutic efficacy, and reduced side effects.
The inclusion of manganese (Mn) in the nanocarriers further boosts the therapeutic effects by enabling chemodynamic therapy (CDT).
Mn ions catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H
