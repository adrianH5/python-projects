A ribonuclease-targeting chimera (RiboTAC) is a heterobifunctional compound that binds to an RNA target and recruits a ribonuclease to cleave the bound RNA.
This study investigates the impact of linker length and composition on RiboTAC potency in leukemia and breast cancer cellular models.
Increasing linker length from two polyethylene glycol units to eight increased RiboTAC potency, while longer linker lengths decreased potency.
The optimized RiboTAC reduced the abundance of oncogenic
