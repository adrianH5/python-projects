Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is accompanied by endocrine dysfunction, particularly involving dysregulation of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways.
Clinical manifestations such as hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common and have been linked to aberrant expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs).
However, the specific roles and mechanisms of IGFBP family genes in PDAC remain unclear.
