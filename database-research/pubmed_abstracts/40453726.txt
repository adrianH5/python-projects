Research has indicated that both total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels may impact the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).
However, as TC and LDL cholesterol consist of multiple lipid species, it remains uncertain which specific species contribute to this risk.
Therefore, this study plans to search for the major lipid species that influence the risk of CRC.
