Administrative medicine dispensing data often omit prescribed duration, which is important for research on adherence or other pharmacoepidemiological topics.
While the reverse waiting time distribution (rWTD) method has been widely used to estimate prescribed durations, its accuracy in real-world dispensing data is unknown.
We assessed the performance of the rWTD method against the actual prescribed duration recorded in the Rotterdam Study.
