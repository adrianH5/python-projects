The case of an 80-year-old postmenopausal patient presenting with metrorrhagia and advanced endometrial cancer with bone metastasis to the femur, detected by MRI.
Bone metastases in endometrial carcinoma, although rare (5%-10% of advanced cases), can lead to pain, fractures, and reduced mobility.
Imaging, particularly MRI, plays a crucial role in diagnosis.
Treatment includes palliative care, radiation therapy to relieve pain, and sometimes surgical interventions.
The prognosis is generally poor, with reduced survival.
Research should focus on targeted therapies and early detection of metastases.
