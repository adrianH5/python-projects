The development of precise molecular biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis holds immense potential to improve treatment outcomes.
This study aimed to investigate the role of amino acid metabolism genes as predictive markers for breast cancer prognosis and their association with the immune-tumour microenvironment.
By employing advanced machine learning algorithms and bioinformatics analysis techniques, the impact of amino acid metabolism-related genes (AAMRGs) on the immune status and overall survival of patients with breast cancer was examined.
An AAMRG-based risk model was established to assess the prognostic significance.
Validated risk models (AIMP2, IYD, and QARS1) accurately predicted patient outcomes [1 y: 0.87 (0.96-0.78); 3 y: 0.82 (0.87-0.76); 5 y: 0.80 (0.86-0.75)].
Furthermore, this study revealed evidence suggesting that QARS1 may influence breast cancer cell proliferation through methionine metabolism.
This analysis provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of breast cancer, emphasizing the significance of AAMRGs as prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for optimizing personalized treatment strategies.
