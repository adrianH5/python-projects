Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) non-invasively transmits acoustic energy across the skull, resulting in biological effects.
Although early studies focused on adult movement disorders, transcranial FUS is now being explored for pediatric patients as well.
Here, we review the emerging applications of transcranial FUS in pediatric neurosurgery and explore the unique considerations for this patient population.
