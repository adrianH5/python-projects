3D printing technology stands as a transformative force in medicine, offering outstanding precision and personalization in surgical planning, patient education, and the development of anatomical models for complex procedures.
This paper aims to explore the application experiences of 3D printing in endoscopic skull base tumor surgeries, evaluating the impact and effectiveness of 3D-printed models in enhancing both surgical simulations and anatomical learning in the field of neurosurgery for skull base tumors.
