Alcohol consumption increases longer-term health risks, including cancer.
Many adults at midlife in Aotearoa New Zealand drink frequently but may not be aware of such risks.
This study examined midlife adults' awareness of alcohol and health risks and their knowledge of government low-risk drinking guidelines.
A convenience sample of 502 adults (aged 40-65â€‰years; 70% female) completed an online questionnaire.
Almost all respondents reported they were aware of health risks associated with alcohol consumption.
When unprompted, 41% of the sample named cancer as a health risk; when asked if they knew that alcohol use was associated with cancer, 61% agreed.
For one-third of these respondents, this awareness did not motivate them to drink less.
Most knew government drinking guidelines existed although did not know what they were.
To support midlife adults to drink less, we need more insight into how they make sense of the long-term health risks of alcohol.
