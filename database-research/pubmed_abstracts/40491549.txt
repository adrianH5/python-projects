Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent cancers globally, with 2.3 million new cases annually in 2023.
In Brazil, it is estimated that there are 74,000 new cases per year, representing 20.3Â % of cancers in women in the country.
Limited access to adequate treatment forces patients to seek care elsewhere, straining the healthcare system and delaying treatment initiation.
This study aimed to determine the migration rate of BC patients in Brazil and specifically to analyze migration rate by stage and treatment modality, as well as its costs and possible reasons for delays.
