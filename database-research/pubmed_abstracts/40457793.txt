Tubal ciliary movement is one of the essential transport mechanisms for female fertility, playing a key role in facilitating oocyte pickup and transporting the fertilized ovum.
This movement is mediated by multiciliated cells and regulated by specific proteins and hormones that modulate ciliary number, length, polarity, beat frequency, and amplitude to ensure proper function.
Genetic mutations, inflammatory stimuli, and hormonal fluctuations can impair ciliary activity or induce ciliary apoptosis, leading to ciliary dysfunction.
Disorders of tubal ciliary movement are frequently observed in primary ciliary dyskinesia, pelvic inflammatory disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, and endometriosis, conditions commonly associated with female infertility.
These disorders manifest as structural abnormalities of cilia, disrupted polarity, shortened ciliary length, reduced ciliary count, and decreased beat frequency and amplitude.
Understanding the role of tubal ciliary movement in female infertility-related diseases, through immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural analysis, helps clarify underlying infertility mechanisms.
Identifying abnormal inflammatory factors, hormonal environments, and gene expression, combined with advanced techniques for measuring ciliary protein and beat frequency, may offer novel clinical targets for early prevention and treatment of female infertility.
