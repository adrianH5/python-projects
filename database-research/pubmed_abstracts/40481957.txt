Parents of children with cancer experience treatment-related employment disruptions.
Most significant shifts occur during diagnosis and treatment.
However, challenges can persist into survivorship.
We explored employment changes during diagnosis and treatment among parents of children with cancer, and professional and financial impact during long-term survivorship.
We investigated (1) if and what kind of employment changes occurred, (2) reasons for the changes, (3) differences between mothers and fathers, and (4) if parents experience long-term professional or financial impacts from their child's past illness.
