Nivolumab, a human immunoglobulin IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 receptor, received initial FDA approval in 2014 for treating unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma (MM), followed by approval for metastatic squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 2015.
With expanding clinical applications of nivolumab, comprehensive evaluation of its safety profile in real-world healthcare settings becomes increasingly crucial.
