This systematic review intends to find out how neurodevelopmental disorders, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), are influenced by the gut microbiota throughout early childhood.
The study looks at the variety and types of microbes that a child is exposed to, the particular microbiome profiles associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the molecular processes that underlie these relationships.
