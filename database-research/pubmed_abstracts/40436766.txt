Gastric cancer (GC) is defined as the primary epithelial malignancy derived from the stomach.
This study aims to investigate the predictive and prognostic values of mitotic spindle positioning (MISP) expression in patients with GC, providing new strategies for GC diagnosis and prognosis.
MISP expression in GC tissues and adjacent tissues from 120 GC patients was detected.
The correlation between pathological characteristics and MISP expression was analyzed.
Pathological conditions of patients after 5 years of postoperative treatment were recorded.
The correlation between MISP expression and postoperative outcomes of GC patients was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze independent risk factors affecting the 5-year survival rate of GC patients.
MISP expression in GC tissues was higher than in adjacent tissues.
MISP expression was correlated with differentiation degree, invasion, lymph node metastasis, and Lauren classification.
Patients in the high MISP expression group tended to have poorer postoperative outcomes.
High MISP expression was an independent risk factor for the 5-year survival rate of GC patients.
In conclusion, high expression of MISP in GC patients indicates a higher possibility of adverse prognosis and is an independent risk factor affecting the post-operative survival rate of GC patients.
