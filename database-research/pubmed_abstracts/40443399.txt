Aberrant upregulation or mutations of EZH2 frequently occur in human cancers.
However, the clinical benefits of EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) remain unsatisfactory for majority of solid tumors.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to expand the therapeutic benefits of EZH2i.
Nanocarriers have gained increased attention due to their advantages of prolonged blood circulation, enhanced cellular uptake, and active targeting capabilities.
This study aims to address the challenges of EZH2i GSK126's limited efficacy and severe adverse effects against solid tumors.
