Driver gene alterations are increasingly being identified, and multiplex genetic tests have become essential for determining the optimal treatment method for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables the simultaneous detection of multiple driver gene alterations using nucleic acids extracted from tumor tissue samples.
However, obtaining sufficient tumor tissue volume is challenging, and inadequate formalin fixation can lead to the failure of NGS analysis.
Malignant pleural effusions can be collected using a simple, minimally invasive technique; however, it remains uncertain whether pleural fluid is a suitable source for detecting driver gene alterations using NGS.
This retrospective observational study examined the suitability of fresh-frozen pleural fluid pellets for NGS in clinical practice.
