Ferroptosis, a distinctive form of cell death induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, is implicated in various biological processes, including liver diseases.
Establishing an iron overload-induced ferroptosis model and identifying hepatic gene signatures associated with ferroptosis are crucial for understanding its role in liver pathogenesis.
