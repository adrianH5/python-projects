Spastic paraplegia type 4 (SPG4; also known as SPAST-HSP), the most prevalent variant among pure Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSPs), is clinically characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs.
The present neuroimaging study specifically investigated possible changes in the corticospinal (CST) and thalamo-cortical tracts (TCT) structural integrity and broader cortical, subcortical and spinal pathways, topographically related to upper and lower limbs in SPG4.
