Inhibiting γ-secretase mediated Notch signaling has been explored as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and cancer.
However, clinical trials have revealed that this approach can lead to side effects, such as gut inflammation.
Notch signaling has been shown to be a key mediator of intestinal epithelial homeostasis.
We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of γ-secretase inhibition-associated colitis.
