For immediate facial nerve reconstruction during head and neck tumor resection, a great auricular nerve (GAN) graft can be potentially harvested in the same surgical field during tumor resection.
However, it is often avoided because a GAN graft is only approximately 5â€‰cm long without any branches, and a sural nerve graft is recommended for larger defects.
We investigated the length of the GAN that can be harvested in 18 patients, along with the evaluation of postoperative facial nerve palsy.
