Cancer cells undergo widespread changes in epigenetic patterns that mediate cancer compromised gene expression programs during cancer progression.
However, the alterations in higher-order genome organization in which these changes occur and their functional implications are less well understood.
To explore how chromatin structure and epigenetic parameters of genome architecture changes during cancer progression at a fine scale and genome-wide, we generated high-resolution Micro-C contact maps in non-malignant, pre-cancerous, and metastatic MCF10 breast cancer epithelial cells.
