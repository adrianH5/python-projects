Gallbladder cancer, a malignant tumor with a notable prevalence, is primarily treated with surgical R0 resection, which remains the most efficacious therapeutic strategy.
Achieving this level of resection is particularly challenging for patients diagnosed at intermediate or advanced stages.
Numerous clinical studies focusing on preoperative translational therapies, predominantly those utilizing chemotherapy, have substantiated their capacity to increase surgical resection and survival rates of patients with gallbladder cancer, despite the persistently low rate of R0 resection.
The emergence of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the postchemotherapy era, in conjunction with localized radiotherapy, has led to promising outcomes in preoperative treatment studies across a spectrum of solid tumors.
