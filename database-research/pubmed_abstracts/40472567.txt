Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) and resection is one treatment option for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer.
In some patients, the full chemotherapy regimen is not completed.
We assessed the association between incomplete administration of neoadjuvant chemo(radiation) and pathological response (pCR) and overall survival (OS) in esophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) and squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
