Clinical isolates of Candida auris show a high prevalence of resistance to Amphotericin B (AmB)-an uncommon trait in most Candida species.
Alterations in ergosterol biosynthesis can contribute to acquired AmB resistance in C. auris laboratory strains but are rarely seen in clinical isolates.
In this study, we experimentally evolved two drug-susceptible Clade II isolates of C. auris to develop AmB resistance.
The evolved strains displayed a four to eight fold increase in MIC
