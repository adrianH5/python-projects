Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is among the most prevalent malignancies worldwide.
Cuproptosis, a copper-induced form of cell death, has been identified as a key process in LUAD progression; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying cuproptosis in LUAD and potential therapeutic targets remain unclear.
The present study utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas database to retrieve mRNA expression profiles and clinical information of LUAD, identifying 10 candidate genes from differentially expressed genes associated with cuproptosis.
Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that CDK inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), an upregulated gene in LUAD, may function as a hub gene.
Furthermore, multiple online databases were used to analyze Spi-1 proto-oncogene (SPI1), a transcription factor upstream of CDKN2A, which was downregulated in LUAD cuproptosis.
The LinkedOmics database identified the p53-mediated cuproptosis-related pathway regulated by CDKN2A.
Gene expression patterns were examined through Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, the Human Protein Atlas and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
Prognostic significance was assessed using the UALCAN and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases.
