Patients with ileocolic Crohn's disease often require surgery that can result in temporary stoma formation.
Stomas are associated with a morbidity and can negatively impact quality of life.
This study aimed to investigate the short-term (6-month) and mid-term (18-month) outcomes of intended temporary stomas in patients with Crohn's disease.
