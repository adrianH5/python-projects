As an indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic pillar of respiratory medicine, interventional pulmonology has made transformative progress through technological convergence and precision innovation.
Milestones in 2024 include robotic bronchoscopy systems, airway ablation techniques that redefine the management of peripheral lung cancer, and bronchoscopy-regenerative medicine synergy.
Together, these advances are driving the field towards personalized intervention paradigms, enhancing both early disease detection and advanced therapeutic delivery in pulmonary medicine.
