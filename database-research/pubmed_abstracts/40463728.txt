Ensuring lifelong health among aging populations necessitates comprehensive assessments of functional recovery and quality of life, particularly for vulnerable groups such as older adult stroke survivors.
While the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) 3.0 is a widely validated instrument for evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in stroke survivors, its psychometric properties have not yet been examined in the Vietnamese context.
This study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Vietnamese version of the SIS 3.0 (V-SIS 3.0), providing a robust tool to support holistic, multidimensional approaches to stroke rehabilitation in aging populations.
