Fluoropyrimidines (FP), including 5-fluorouracil and its prodrug capecitabine, are commonly employed in treating various solid tumors.
Nonetheless, their use is frequently constrained by severe toxicities in 20%-30% of patients.
Pharmacogenetic testing for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) deficiency, based on DPYD polymorphisms, has notably decreased severe adverse events, improving the safety of FP therapy.
