The concept of control is crucial for effectively understanding and applying biological network models.
Key structural features relate to control functions through gene regulation, signaling, or metabolic mechanisms, and computational models need to encode these.
Applications often focus on model-based control, such as in biomedicine or metabolic engineering.
In a recent paper, the authors developed a theoretical framework of modularity in Boolean networks, which led to a canonical semidirect product decomposition of these systems.
In this paper, we present an approach to model-based control that exploits this modular structure, as well as the canalizing features of the regulatory mechanisms.
We show how to identify control strategies from the individual modules, and we present a criterion based on canalizing features of the regulatory rules to identify modules that do not contribute to network control and can be excluded.
For even moderately sized networks, finding global control inputs is computationally challenging.
Our modular approach leads to an efficient approach to solving this problem.
We apply it to a published Boolean network model of blood cancer large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia to identify a minimal control set that achieves a desired control objective.
