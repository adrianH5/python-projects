Whether the surgical case order is an important factor affecting the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with GC has always been a concern.
This study aimed to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of different surgical case orders METHODS: We included patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted radical gastrectomy at the Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University (Fuzhou, China) between January 2016 and December 2017.
In total, 1235 patients (No.1 (n=497), No.2 (n=426), and Other groups (n=312)) were included in the propensity score matching (PSM, 1:1:1).
