The increasing number of organ transplant recipients has led to a rise in cancer diagnoses in this population.
Kidney transplant recipients, in particular, have a two-to-four-fold higher risk of developing cancer due to immunosuppressive therapy.
The management of gynecologic cancers in this subset of patients presents unique challenges due to anatomical considerations, immunosuppression, and the nephrotoxicity of oncologic treatments.Case Presentation.A 44-year-old woman with a history of polycystic kidney disease underwent a bilateral nephrectomy followed by a living-related intraperitoneal renal transplant.
She presented with pelvic pain and was found to have high-grade ovarian adenocarcinoma, possibly arising from endometriosis.
Surgical staging included total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and right pelvic lymph node dissection.
The patient underwent six cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy while maintaining stable renal function with close monitoring of immunosuppressive drug levels.
Surveillance imaging detected recurrence in the right pelvic lymph nodes, leading to secondary tumor debulking and whole pelvic radiation therapy.
Despite a slight increase in creatinine, kidney function remained stable, and the patient has remained disease-free on subsequent follow-ups.
