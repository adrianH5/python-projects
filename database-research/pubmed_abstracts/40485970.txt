Myofibroma (MF) is an uncommon benign mesenchymal neoplasm composed of myofibroblasts.
Traumatic neuroma (TN) is a non-neoplastic proliferative disorder of the nerve sheath in response to injury or surgery.
Both are uncommon in the jaws.
We present a case of a 39-year-old Afro-descendant woman with a unilocular radiolucent lesion in the posterior mandible, showing mild expansion and cortical disruption.
Biopsy revealed proliferation of fascicularly arranged spindle cells strongly positive for Î±-SMA and podoplanin, with low Ki-67 (<5%), and the final diagnosis was central MF.
Ten months after enucleation and curettage, persistent pain led to a second biopsy, which revealed proliferation of multiple hyperplastic nerve fascicles consistent with TN.
The postoperative course was uneventful with 14-month follow-up.
A discussion on the clinicopathological criteria for differential diagnosis of MF and other spindle cell tumors as well as the rare occurrence of post-surgical TN is also provided.
