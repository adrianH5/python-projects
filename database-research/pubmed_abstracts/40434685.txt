Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows an improvement of pathological complete response rate in triple-negative breast cancer patients.
The objective of the study is to evaluate the correlation between breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and pathological response after NAC and immunotherapy.
It also aims to compare the performances of an abbreviated protocol using ultrafast MRI (UF-MRI) sequences with that of full-protocol MRI (fpMRI).
