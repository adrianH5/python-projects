One of the main causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
At every stage of the disease, HCC may now be treated using a variety of therapy techniques.
Nevertheless, despite the abundance of effective therapeutic choices, the prognosis for patients with HCC is still typically dismal.
Prognostic indicators are crucial when assessing prognosis and tracking tumor metastases or recurrence.
There are many prognostic markers in HCC.
We mainly focused on newly reported prognostic markers such as MEX3A, apolipoprotein B, alpha-fetoprotein, circulating tumor cells, SAMD13, Agrin, and Glypican-3 in the pathogenesis of HCC.
Further, we highlighted how these prognostic markers correlated to clinical parameters such as tumor node metastasis, tumor diameter, differentiation, hepatocirrhosis, vascular invasion, and others in HCC.
Therefore, identifying specific prognostic biomarkers of HCC helps to provide a great opportunity to improve the prognosis in patients with HCC and provide therapeutic targets.
