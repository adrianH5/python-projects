Advancements in early detection and multimodal treatment strategies have significantly improved survival rates for early-stage breast cancer, now exceeding 80% at 10 years.
However, breast cancer survivors (BCS) often experience persistent physical, psychological, and social challenges as direct consequences of cancer and its treatment.
Effective survivorship care requires a proactive, multidisciplinary, and team-based approach to address these burdens comprehensively.
Despite growing recognition of the complex needs of BCS, a persistent gap remains between symptom burden, supportive care needs, and actual care delivery.
This disparity underscores the urgent need to innovate and optimize survivorship care models.
This article explores the most prevalent symptoms and concerns experienced by BCS, particularly those arising from systemic and local therapies during post-treatment follow-up phase, and outlines evidence-based strategies for their management.
Additionally, it examines the role of technology as a promising enabler in enhancing the quality, efficiency, accessibility, and patient-centeredness of survivorship care.
By integrating multidisciplinary, proactive symptom management with digital health tools and innovative care approaches, health care systems can be equipped to better support BCS, ultimately improving their long-term health outcomes and quality of life.
