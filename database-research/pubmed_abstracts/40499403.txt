Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynaecological malignancy, often diagnosed at an advanced stage with widespread peritoneal dissemination and lymph node involvement, particularly in retroperitoneal and pelvic regions.
The Peritoneal Cancer Index(PCI) is used to assess peritoneal disease but does not address nodal metastasis, an important prognostic factor.
The Nodal Cancer Index(NCI) was developed to quantify lymph node burden, improving surgical precision.
