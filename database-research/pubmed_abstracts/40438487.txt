Meningiomas represent the most prevalent benign intracranial tumors, comprising 13-26% of primary intracranial neoplasms.
These tumors derive their blood supply from both extracranial and intracranial circulation.
Over recent decades, pre-operative embolization (POE) has emerged as a potential adjunctive therapy to surgery, aiming to reduce tumor vascularity.
Our study seeks to explore the potential correlation between the extent of devascularization following POE of meningiomas and intraoperative blood loss.
