New techniques for creating anastomoses have been evolving as colorectal surgery shifts toward more minimally invasive robotic platforms.
However, robotic rectal cancer surgery still typically involves partial extracorporeal manipulation to secure the anastomotic anvil.
We previously performed a simple robotic purse-string suture (RPSS) in complete intracorporeal double-stapling technique (DST) anastomosis and first reported its benefit in the surgical time and the burden on the assistant.
Moreover, transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) for lower rectal cancer has attracted much attention due to emphasis on oncological safety and functional preservation.
Even in TaTME, fixation of the anvil for single-stapling technique (SST) anastomosis is usually performed extracorporeally through the perineum, but in some cases, bulky tumor and/or narrow pelvis can make it difficult to get the specimen out of the perineum.
