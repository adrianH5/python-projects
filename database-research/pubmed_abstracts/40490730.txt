Compared to syringe needles, stylet needles are hypothesized to enhance the specimen adequacy of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) by potentially minimizing blood contamination.
However, this hypothesis lacks robust evidence for substantiation.
Additionally, the substantially higher cost of stylet needles (often several orders of magnitude greater than syringe needles) raises concerns about increased procedural expenses.
This study aimed to compare the outcomes of thyroid FNA using stylet versus syringe needles in a large cohort.
