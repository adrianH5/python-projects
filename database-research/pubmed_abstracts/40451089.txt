Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States.
Area-level deprivation increases CRC risk, but traditional indices and analyses have limitations.
Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression and hierarchical Bayesian approaches offer better alternatives for highly correlated indicators and addresses spatial dependencies and reliability issues.
The purpose of this study is to identify the most explanatory area-level neighborhood deprivation indicators and investigate its association with CRC incidence using advanced spatiotemporal methods.
