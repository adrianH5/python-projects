N4BP3 is a ubiquitination-related gene that plays a pivotal role in neurology and neoplasia.
Studies have demonstrated its essential function in axonal and dendritic branching, promoting hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer.
Our previous research reveals that N4BP3 enhances inflammatory responses by modulating the NOD2 signaling pathway.
It is crucial to investigate whether N4BP3 regulates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the TLR4 signaling pathway and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
