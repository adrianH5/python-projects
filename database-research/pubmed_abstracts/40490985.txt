Vulvar cancer may cause serious local symptoms that may impact negatively on the woman's health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
However, knowledge about the prevalence of vulvar and lymphedema symptoms at diagnosis and during follow-up is limited.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal development of vulvar and lymphedema symptoms as well as the trajectory of HRQOL in women with vulvar cancer.
Furthermore, associations between vulvar symptoms and HRQOL were investigated.
