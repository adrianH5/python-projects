Patients with dysphagia due to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy often have chewing difficulty.
Kinematic analysis of mandibular movements may provide clinically useful information for the chewing function.
However, current kinematic device costs limited clinical application, and specialized software is required for control and data processing.
This study aimed to mandibular kinematics parameter recognition using a self-developed Nswallow 2D motion capture software.
To investigate whether differences in kinematic data of mandibular movements during mastication can be used as an indicator of masticatory dysfunction in NPC patients, and to examineÂ relationship with mastication efficiency.
