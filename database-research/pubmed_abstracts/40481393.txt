Genome data from cancer patients represents relationships between the presence of a gene mutation and cancer occurrence in a patient.
Different types of cancer in human are thought to be caused by combinations of two to nine gene mutations.
Identifying these combinations through traditional exhaustive search requires the amount of computation that scales exponentially with the combination size and in most cases is intractable even for cutting-edge supercomputers.
We propose a parameter-free heuristic approach that leverages the intrinsic topology of gene-patient mutations to identify carcinogenic combinations.
The biological relevance of the identified combinations is measured by using them to predict the presence of tumor in previously unseen samples.
The resulting classifiers for 16 cancer types perform on par with exhaustive search results, and score the average of 80.1% sensitivity and 91.6% specificity for the best choice of hit range per cancer type.
Our approach is able to find higher-hit carcinogenic combinations targeting which would take years of computations using exhaustive search.
