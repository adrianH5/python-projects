Late effect clinics (LECs) post-primary cancer treatment emerge.
We explored healthcare professionals' experiences working in Danish LECs from a psychodynamic perspective seeking to understand how professionals from different disciplines navigate their roles and collaborate within the context of survivorship care.
We employed a qualitative approach through three virtual focus groups with nurses, physicians, and psychologists n = 15.
All respectively working in five different LECs with patients and caregivers affected by general late effects after cancer treatment.
Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
Four themes were found: Transformation towards person-centered care, therapeutic space as a precondition, redefined professional boundaries, and challenges due to traditional hospital structures.
The themes revealed that patients with late effects and their caregivers require a bio-psychosocial and person-centered approach, with an emphasis on creating a therapeutic space as a prerequisite for cooperation.
The professionals were willing to expand their professional boundaries but were challenged by systemic hierarchy and the constant need for competency and team development.
Experiences and dynamics within professional roles in Danish LECs have significant implications for rethinking the organization and professional development of care.
These insights suggest the need to empower healthcare professionals, adapt to evolving professional roles, and enhance person-centered care in this unique survivorship context.
Improved collaboration across roles could provide survivors with more cohesive, supportive care, though traditional hospital hierarchies pose challenges.
Increased professional development promises a higher level of tailored, competent care for addressing complex late effects during survivorship.
