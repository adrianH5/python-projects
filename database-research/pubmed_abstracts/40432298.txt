Nearly half of patients with cancer are diagnosed at 70â€‰years or older, which presents challenges in cancer care due to their high comorbidity burden and the underrepresentation of this age group in clinical trials.
This retrospective study evaluated the association between comorbidity burden and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment outcomes among older adults.
