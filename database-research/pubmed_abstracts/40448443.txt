The urea cycle occurs mainly in the liver and undergoes changes during hepatocarcinogenesis.
Argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) is a key enzyme in the urea cycle and is expressed at low levels in certain cancers.
LM2I, a specific activator of ASS1, exhibits significant antitumor activity.
However, the antitumor mechanism of LM2I in liver cancer remains unclear.
In this study, we find that LM2I is more effective for liver cancer cells with low ASS1 expression.
The results of the IP-LC/MS experiments reveal that ASS1 interacts with CAD.
The expressions of ASS1 and CAD in liver cancer tissues and cells are negatively correlated.
LM2I promotes the ubiquitination of CAD protein through ASS1.
LM2I inhibits the proliferation of liver cancer cells
