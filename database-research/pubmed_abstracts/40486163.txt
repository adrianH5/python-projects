Uterine fibroids, although common and benign, may occasionally present with atypical features, including rare forms of degeneration, which can obscure their clinical and radiological identification.
These unusual presentations may simulate adnexal or ovarian neoplasms, posing a significant diagnostic challenge.
Pelvic imaging particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role by offering high-resolution characterization of the lesion's composition, origin, and relationship to adjacent structures, thus guiding appropriate therapeutic strategies.
We report a clinical case that underscores this diagnostic complexity and emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced imaging modalities to establish an accurate diagnosis.
