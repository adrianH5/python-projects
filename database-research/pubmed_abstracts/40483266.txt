Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer typically diagnosed at advanced stages.
Although many cases initially respond to conventional therapies, IBC remains refractory, with high risk of recurrence due to early dissemination, tumor heterogeneity, and complex microenvironmental factors.
Despite advancements in treatment, IBC poses unique challenges, particularly in community healthcare settings, where implementation of current guidelines is often limited by disease complexity and evidence gaps.
Multidisciplinary care is essential and should include education on therapeutic options, lymphedema management, financial navigations, and ongoing support.
To support diagnostic consistency, a consensus-driven IBC Scoring System has been developed to help clinicians identify IBC more accurately using clinical features This paper reviews best practices for managing IBC in community settings, emphasizing practical, multidisciplinary strategies that improve outcomes and presenting a framework aligns with the realities of community healthcare to ensure patients receive the highest possible standard of care.
