Proper regulation of inflammatory responses is essential for organismal health.
Dysregulation can lead to accelerated development of the diseases of aging and the aging process itself.
Here, we identify a novel enzymatic activity of the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 as a lysine deitaconylase that regulates macrophage inflammatory responses.
Itaconate is a metabolite abundantly produced in activated macrophages.
We find it forms a protein modification called lysine itaconylation.
Using biochemical and proteomics approaches, we demonstrate that SIRT4 efficiently removes this modification from target proteins both
