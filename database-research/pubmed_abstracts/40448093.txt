Contaminated sites are among the main worldwide environmental health priorities.
The health impact on population living in Italian contaminated sites of national concern for remediation (CSs) with petrochemical/refineries (P&R) and steel plants (S) was estimated.
Since these CSs include the major Italian facilities located widespread on the territory are representative of the national reality.
Furthermore, the population exposed in P&R and S is significant since it represents about 3% of the national population.
