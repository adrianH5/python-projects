Pediatric cancer refers to cancers that occur in children and adolescents, typically defined as those occuringÂ under the age of 18.
Although childhood cancers are relatively rare compared to adult cancers, they are a leading cause of death by disease in children.
Early detection of childhood cancer is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and survival rates.
To detect pediatric cancers in their early stages, the identification of biomarkers can be very helpful.
Optical sensors and biosensors, as new analytical devices, can be used as a powerful and non-invasive tool to detect and quantify various cancer-specific biomarkers.
Nanomaterials play a transformative role in the development of optical (bio)sensors, enhancing their sensitivity, specificity, and overall performance.
Nano optical (bio)sensors provide a non-invasive, swift, and cost-effective method for the early detection of pediatric cancer by identifying cancer-related biomarkers.
