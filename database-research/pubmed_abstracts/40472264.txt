We present a case involving a 62-year-old man diagnosed with acinar-type prostate adenocarcinoma, who was referred for initial staging with 99mTc-PSMA scintigraphy.
Considering the metastatic lesions exhibited low PSMA avidity, a 99mTc-FAPI-46 scintigraphy was conducted to improve the detection of metastases and to potentially facilitate future radio-ligand therapy using FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals.
In this experience, 99mTc-FAPI-46 demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared with 99mTc-PSMA scintigraphy, underscoring its potential utility in cases where tumors exhibit low PSMA expression or when tumor heterogeneity is suspected.
