Prostatitis is a critical factor in promoting carcinogenesis, but the key molecular mechanisms remain unknown.
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) ZFAS1 was reported to be involved in the development of human cancers including prostate cancer and some inflammatory diseases.
This research aims at investigating the function of ZFAS1 in regulating prostatitis to prostate cancer transformation and the underlying mechanism.
