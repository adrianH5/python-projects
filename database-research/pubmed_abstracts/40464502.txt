Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) play critical roles in the pathogenesis of liver diseases, particularly in conditions such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.
This review highlights the diagnostic and prognostic potential of MMPs, emphasizing their involvement in metastasis, de-differentiation, and hepatic cell proliferation.
Utilizing advanced reporter mouse models has proven instrumental in assessing intraglandular MMP activity and predicting metastatic risks, paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.
Current research indicates that specific MMPs and TIMPs can serve as valuable biomarkers for liver function and disease progression, although a clear consensus on their clinical utility remains elusive.
Ongoing studies explore MMP-targeted therapies with potential applications in liver disease management, particularly in reducing fibrosis and enhancing liver regeneration.
Future directions in this field involve elucidating the roles of MMPs in ischemia and transplantation, with the aim of improving clinical outcomes.
Emerging therapeutic strategies focus on achieving a balance between MMP activity and TIMP expression to optimize liver function, highlighting the need for organ-specific targeting.
Overall, this comprehensive overview underscores the importance of MMPs and TIMPs in liver function and liver disease, as well as the necessity for further research to harness their potential in clinical practice.
