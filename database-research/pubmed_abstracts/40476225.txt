The technologies to examine the neuronal microenvironment label free remain critically underexplored.
There is a gap in our knowledge of underlying metabolic, biochemical, and electrophysiological mechanisms behind several neurological processes at a cellular level, which can be traced to the lack of versatile and high-throughput tools to investigate neural networks.
In this paper, four label-free contrasts were explored as mechanisms to study neuronal activity, namely, scattering, birefringence, autofluorescence from metabolic cofactors and molecules, and local biochemistry.
To overcome challenges of observing neuronal activity spanning three orders of magnitude in space and time, microscopes had to be developed to simultaneously capture these contrasts quickly, with high resolution, and over a large FOV.
We developed versatile autofluorescence lifetime, multiharmonic generation, polarization-sensitive interferometry, and Raman imaging in epi-detection (VAMPIRE) microscopy to simultaneously observe multiple facets of neuronal structure and dynamics.
The accelerated computational-imaging-driven acquisition speeds, the utilization of a single light source to evoke all contrasts, the simultaneous acquisition that provides an otherwise impossible multimodal dynamic imaging capability, and the real-time processing of the data enable VAMPIRE microscopy as a powerful imaging platform for neurophotonics and beyond.
