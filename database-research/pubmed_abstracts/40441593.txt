Glioblastoma is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor characterized by rapid development, poor prognosis and high mortality.
The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects of arvanil, olvanil and LY2183240 (three cannabinoid receptor ligands), when used alone and in combination with cisplatin and temozolomide in various neuroblastoma (CHP-134 and KELLY) and glioblastoma (U87MG, C6, and T98G) cell lines in the MTT assay.
Results indicate that arvanil, olvanil and LY2183240 considerably affected the viability of neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines with selectivity index values ranging from 0.50 to 17.48 for arvanil; from 0.93 to 24.06 for olvanil; and from 1.68 to 14.52 for LY2183240.
With isobolographic analysis we found that the combination of LY2183240 with cisplatin produced three different types of interactions: a synergy in CHP-134; an antagonism in T98G; and additivity in KELLY, C6 and U87MG cell lines in the MTT assay.
The combinations of arvanil and olvanil with cisplatin exerted additive interaction in all the tested cell lines in the MTT assay.
Similarly, the combinations of temozolomide with arvanil, olvanil and LY 2183240 produced the additive interaction in all the tested glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines.
In conclusion, the combinations of temozolomide with the three cannabinoids, due to their additive interactions, can be considered as a promising therapeutic direction in glioblastoma.
Favorable combinations of cisplatin with arvanil, olvanil and LY2183240 can also be recommended, except for a combination of cisplatin with LY2183240 in glioblastoma T98G cell line in the MTT assay.
