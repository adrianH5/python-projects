The purpose of this study was to compare dominant and non-dominant leg fat-free mass (FFM) estimations and inter-limb leg FFM asymmetry detection between multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in career firefighters.
Sixty-one male career firefighters (age = 31.9 ± 7.4 years; stature = 179.0 ± 7.6 cm; body mass = 89.9 ± 17.4 kg) volunteered for the investigation and reported to the laboratory on one occasion.
Leg FFM was estimated by measuring the conduction impedance measured through the corresponding sensing and injecting electrodes for MF-BIA and by outlining both legs into regions of interest for DXA.
Inter-limb leg FFM asymmetry was calculated by subtracting the non-dominant limb FFM from the dominant limb FFM, dividing it by the dominant limb FFM, and expressed as a percentage.
Asymmetry was defined as having inter-limb leg FFM asymmetry of ±3%.
