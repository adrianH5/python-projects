Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are common in advanced melanoma and linked to poor prognosis.
Preventing MBM can improve survival and reduce morbidity.
While dual-agent immunotherapy (dIT) improves survival, its role in MBM prevention is unclear.
We compared MBM incidence, overall survival (OS), and brain metastasis-free survival (BMFS) between dIT and single-agent immunotherapies (sIT).
