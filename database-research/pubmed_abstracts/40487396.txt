Cis-diamine-dichloro-platinum (II) (cisplatin) is a widely prescribed anticancer drug known to induce severe side effects, including skeletal muscle atrophy.
As muscle atrophy negatively impacts the prognosis and survival of cancer patients, elucidation of its pathogenesis and development of preventive and treatment methods is important.
Hochuekkito (HET), a Japanese Kampo medicine, has been reported to improve decreased physical activity and muscle weight in various animal models, but not in cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy.
Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the characteristics of cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy and the therapeutic effects of HET, especially with emphasis in the recovery phase.
