Abnormal amino acid metabolism promotes tumor progression by inducing malignant behaviors in tumor cells and altering the immune landscape within the tumor microenvironment.
However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
In this study, we constructed colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models, performing multifaceted validation to confirm that T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5), mediates the biosynthesis of aspartate and enhances sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy.
Mechanistically, CCT5 directly binds to asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and promotes the synthesis of aspartate (Asn).
The Asn-mTORC1 axis facilitates tumor cell proliferation while upregulating PD-L1 expression, which leads to a reduction in the number of effector CD8
