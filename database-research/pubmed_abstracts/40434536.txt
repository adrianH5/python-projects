Immunization has long played essential roles in preventing diseases.
However, the desire for precision delivery of vaccines to boost a robust immune response remains largely unmet.
Here, we describe the use of acupoint delivery of nanovaccines (ADN) to elicit dual-niche immunological priming.
ADN can simultaneously stimulate mast cell-assisted maturation of dendritic cells at the acupoint and enable direct delivery of nanovaccines into the draining lymph nodes.
We demonstrate that ADN not only provokes antigen presentation by lymph node-resident CD8Î±
