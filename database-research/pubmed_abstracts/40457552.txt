Barriers to pediatric palliative care (PPC) integration in pediatric oncology encompass resource availability, provider attitudes, patient/family hesitancy, and timing.
We report on a unique multistep approach for the creation of a pediatric palliative oncology program that (1) optimizes PPC delivery for all resource-typed settings, (2) offers continuity of care by spanning inpatient and outpatient clinical settings, (3) improves PPC equity through standardized referral practices, and (4) promotes collaborator buy-in and partnership through the utilization of tools to introduce PPC to patients/families.
Our model demonstrates success through objective increases in PPC consultation and reported satisfaction from patients, families, and oncologists.
