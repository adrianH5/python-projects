Laws mandating that women be informed of mammographic breast density (MBD) with their mammogram results may increase anxiety.
We report on changes in self-reported levels of anxiety, worry about developing breast cancer (BC), as well as perceived risk of BC resulting from three MBD notification methods: usual care (mailed notification letter), enhanced care (usual care with MBD educational brochure), or interpersonal care (enhanced care with promotora education), among a Latina population.
