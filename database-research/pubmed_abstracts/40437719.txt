Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) forms the bulk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases encountered in clinical practice among the elderly.
For the majority of cases of DLBCL, treatment comprising of Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine and Prednisolone (R-CHOP) is suggested as first line chemotherapy.
However, chemotherapy in the elderly population may be hampered by multiple factors, including reduced bone marrow reserves, significant comorbidities, and greater side effects from chemotherapy.
Treatment as such aims to offer disease control and prolong life whilst minimising treatment related complications in this group of patients.
Treatment with R-mini-CHOP, a reduced dose form of R-CHOP offers survival benefits and is recommended for treatment of elderly DLBCL patients and those who are frail.
Our study examined local Malaysian experience of treating the newly diagnosed elderly DLBCL patient with R-mini- CHOP.
