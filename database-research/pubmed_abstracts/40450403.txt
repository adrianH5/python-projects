Proteasome inhibitors (PI) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are important backbones in early line treatments for patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
This study examined real-world treatment patterns, clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) of double-class exposed (DCE) patients with MM after prior PI and IMiD-based treatment.
