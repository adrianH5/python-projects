Urotensin-II (U-II), a somatostatin-like cyclic undecapeptide has been the center of many studies due to its effect both on physiological and pathophysiological regulation of many diseases.
Recently, U-II has been implicated in the development of breast cancer through its mitogenic and angiogenic actions.
Over the years, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Urotensin II (UTS2) gene, notably rs2890565 (S89N, 3836 C > G/T) and rs228648 (T21M, 143G > A), have been identified.
While the correlation of these polymorphisms with breast cancer has been established, their link to prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear.
This study explores the association of UTS2 gene rs2890565 and rs228648 polymorphisms with PCa susceptibility and metastasis.
