Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) is a cornerstone in the management of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
The integration of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors into NC (NIC) regimens has shown promise; however, its efficacy and safety remain uncertain.
This meta-analysis aims to compare the potential risks and clinical benefits of NIC versus NC in patients with resectable ESCC based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
