Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of noncoding, single-stranded RNA generated by backsplicing, a process where the 5' and 3' ends of an RNA are covalently joined.
Virally encoded circRNAs have been identified in several members of Gammaherpesvirinae, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).
In KSHV, the viral interferon regulatory factor 4 (vIRF4) region produces two isoforms of circRNA (circ-vIRF4) that are detectable during latency and reactivation.
Given the growing literature implicating circRNA in human diseases, a role may exist for circ-vIRF4 in the development of KSHV malignancies.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize the function of vIRF4 circRNAs.
