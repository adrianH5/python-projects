Primary extranodal lymphoma is a rare presentation of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract.
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a rare and aggressive subtype, accounts for only 2.5% of all lymphoid neoplasms and is less commonly localized in the colon.
We present a 79-year-old man with abdominal pain and nausea.
Imaging revealed cecal wall thickening with ileocolic intussusception.
Colonoscopy identified a circumferential cecal mass, necessitating robotic-assisted right hemicolectomy.
Final pathology confirmed MCL.
The patient recovered well without complications.
Colorectal MCL is a rare and aggressive NHL variant requiring a multidisciplinary approach.
Surgery plays a crucial role in managing complications and localized disease.
Given the lack of standardized treatment protocols, further research is needed to optimize therapeutic strategies and long-term outcomes.
