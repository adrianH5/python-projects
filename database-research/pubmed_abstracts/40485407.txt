Oral cancer is the common reason for the poor prognosis in head and neck carcinomas and the increase in morbidity and mortality rates.
The biological behavior of cancer is a complex process.
About 50-60% of solid tumors exhibit hypoxic areas within the tumor stroma, which was influenced by the transcriptional activity of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).
HIF promotes stemness and the proliferation of vessel-like structures in tumors, which leads to invasion and metastasis.
