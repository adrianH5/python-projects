The TCbHP regimen, consisting of combining docetaxel (T), carboplatin (Cb), trastuzumab (H), and pertuzumab (P), is the preferred neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer.
However, about 40â€¯% of patients develop resistance to this treatment.
Adding TKIs like pyrotinib to anti-HER2 antibodies may enhance efficacy and reduce resistance, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.
