We analyzed 193 Fanconi anemia patients from the Italian Registry, focusing on hematological outcome, cancer risk, and mortality, both in transplanted (n = 130, 67.4% of the cohort) and non-transplanted (n = 63, 36.6% of the cohort) patients.
After a median follow-up of 7 years, almost all patients developed cytopenia that was more frequent in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
The cumulative overall survival from birth was 91.0% at age 10 years, 71.6% at age 20, and 47.4% at age 30 years; the median survival age was 29.1 years.
When stratifying patients by indication for transplantation (moderate vs. severe cytopenia vs. persistent poor prognosis cytogenetic alterations/acute myeloid leukemia), we found a 5-year cumulative mortality higher, though not significantly (p = 0.281) in the last group.
Cancers were the second most common cause of death in the whole cohort after infections.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent cancer, followed by hematologic neoplasms.
The cumulative incidence of solid/hematological malignancy remarkably increased after 20 years of age and was 51.7% at age 40 years.
The risk of malignancies was greater in subjects who received HSCT (sub-distribution azard ratio 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1-7.5, p = 0.024).
We also identified a small group of patients with stable or even improved cytopenia over time without transplant, thus confirming that bone marrow failure is not automatic in all patients and heightening the importance of tight monitoring to surveil on the worsening of hematopoietic function and cancer occurrence.
Overall, this study provides important findings that may help to make robust clinical decisions.
