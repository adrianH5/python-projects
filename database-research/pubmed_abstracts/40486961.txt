Penile cancer (PeCa) is a rare malignancy strongly associated with poor genital hygiene and is more prevalent in regions with low socioeconomic status.
PeCa accounts for approximately 2% to 4% of all male cancers in Brazil, with higher incidence in the North and Northeast regions.
Despite its aggressive nature, the molecular mechanisms underlying PeCa remain poorly understood.
We performed whole-exome sequencing in a Brazilian cohort of patients with PeCa to identify potentially pathogenic genetic alterations associated with tumor development and progression.
