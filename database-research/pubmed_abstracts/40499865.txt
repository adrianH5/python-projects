Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs with covalently closed loop structures, offering high stability and resistance to exonuclease degradation-traits that make them promising for diagnostic and therapeutic use.
CircRNAs participate in diverse cellular processes, including acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, modulating transcription, binding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), regulating translation, and influencing immune responses.
Emerging evidence links circRNAs to viral infections, such as HBV, HCV, influenza A virus, and EBV, where altered circRNA expression affects viral replication, immune evasion, and host responses via the circRNA/miRNA/mRNA axis.
This review highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circRNAs in viral infections.
We examine their roles in viral pathogenesis, focusing on their mechanisms, regulatory networks, and interactions with host and viral components.
CircRNAs show differential expression in viral versus non-viral conditions, making them promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease stratification.
They may also support vaccine development or serve as tools in antiviral gene therapies.
Despite their promise, challenges persist-such as optimizing in vitro synthesis, improving delivery (e.g., lipid nanoparticles), and minimizing immunogenicity and off-target effects.
Continued research is essential to refine delivery methods and validate circRNA-based strategies in clinical models.
