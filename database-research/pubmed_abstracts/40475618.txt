Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant primary pediatric brain tumor.
Current therapies are ineffective for targeting proliferation, leptomeningeal migration, and metastasis of MB cancer cells to visceral organs and therefore, novel treatments are needed.
The small GTPase, RAC1, has emerged as an important regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, proliferation, and migration in several cancers.
However, it has not been characterized in MB and no clinical drug candidates have been described for RAC1 in MB.
Here we demonstrate that RAC1 levels are higher in MB tissue relative to normal cerebellum.
Further, RAC1 depletion significantly reduces proliferation and migration of Shh-MB cells
