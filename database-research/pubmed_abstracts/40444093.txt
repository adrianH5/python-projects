In oncology, the relationships among cervical central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), biochemical tests, and ultrasound characteristics in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remain controversial.
This association is currently not well supported by evidence, which emphasizes the need for further research.
Understanding the connection between CLNM, biochemical testing, and ultrasound features is crucial for clinical practice and public health efforts.
Research on this topic is still underway and is now receiving much interest.
Our goal was to create and verify a basic cervical lymph node metastasis prediction model.
