Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP) is a rare neoplasm.
Familiarity of its radiologic features may allow preoperative diagnosis and improve management of patients.
However, radiological studies on the comparison of imaging findings between SFTP and other thoracic tumors are scarce.
This study aims to evaluate the radiologic features of SFTP on biphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images with focus on the differential diagnosis.
