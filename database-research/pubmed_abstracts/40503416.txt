Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a common sexually transmitted disease and a leading cause of cervical, other anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers.
Screening for precancerous lesions is an effective strategy for preventing HPV-related tumors.
Although HPV vaccination has significantly reduced the incidence of cervical cancer, achieving universal coverage remains challenging because of cost barriers, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions.
This review provides an update of HPV infection characteristics, screening methods, and strategies tailored to low-resource settings.
We also discuss the global burden of HPV-related diseases, regional disparities in the implementation of screening, and future research directions.
By examining the current challenges and opportunities, this review aims to inform policymakers and healthcare providers in designing effective, affordable, and scalable screening programs.
