Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) functions as a key negative regulator of T cell receptor signaling and has been considered a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.
Despite great progress in developing HPK1 inhibitors, no small-molecule inhibitors have been approved for cancer treatment to date.
Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a novel series of macrocyclic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives as HPK1 inhibitors.
Among these, the representative compound 21 exhibited potent HPK1 inhibition with an IC
