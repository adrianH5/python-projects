Cancer incidence and mortality trends represent epidemiological indicators of fundamental importance for public health systems.
The study's aim is to present recent (2013-2017) short-term cancer incidence and mortality trends in Italy, including 80 % of the Italian population, for different cancer sites by sex, age group, and areas.
Joinpoint Regression models were employed.
A significantly decreasing trend in the incidence of all cancers was observed for men in Italy (-1.9 % per year), particularly for cancers of the lung (-2.5 %), liver (-3.9 %), stomach (-2.8 %), colorectal (-2.2 %), prostate (-3.4 %), and leukaemias (-3.2 %).
The only significant increase was seen for skin melanoma (+5.2 % per year).
Among women, overall cancer incidence remained stable, with a decrease in the North (-0.6 %) and an increase in the South and Islands (+0.9 %).
Decreasing trends were observed for colorectal (-1.9 %), stomach (-3.5 %), liver (-4.0 %%), and leukaemias (-2.0 %) cancers, while incidence increased for skin melanoma (+6.0 % per year), and lung cancer (2.3 %).
Cancer mortality declined consistently in both sexes (-1.8 % per year in men and -0.6 % in women), across different areas, and age groups.
The observed trends in men and women partly reflect the impact of risk factors affecting both sexes at different times, mainly in the case of tobacco and lung cancer.
Also, some trends may be linked to organized screening initiatives (e.g.
colorectal) or the decrease in opportunistic screening (e.g.
prostate).
The snapshot of cancer trends in Italy may highlight new opportunities for strengthening prevention activities and advancing research on early detection and target treatments.
