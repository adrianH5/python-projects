Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant primary intracranial tumor.
Owing to its unfavorable prognosis and frequent recurrence, patient outcomes are poor even with standard treatment.
Recent studies have reported that FTY720, a structurally modified sphingosine extracted from Cordyceps sinensis, has preclinical antitumor efficacy and can regulate the microenvironment of GBM.
However, the mechanism and effective utilization of FTY720, i.e., avoiding adverse reactions during systemic application in GBM remain unclear.
