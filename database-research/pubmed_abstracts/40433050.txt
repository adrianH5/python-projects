Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies in men and accurate diagnostic tools are needed for early detection and risk stratification.
Standard diagnostic modalities have limitations including low specificity, overdiagnosis, and procedural invasiveness.
We investigate the utility of molecular diagnostics, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for identifying mutations in genes that predispose to PCa.
