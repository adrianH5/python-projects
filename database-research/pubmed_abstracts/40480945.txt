Lung cancer screening (LCS) is indicated exclusively for older individuals with substantial tobacco use, a risk factor not only for lung cancer but also for other malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Because LCS trial populations are commonly regarded as healthier than the broader LCS-eligible population, the real-world mortality rate among individuals undergoing LCS represents a key consideration in LCS implementation.
