To evaluate the degree and rate of bladder filling during magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear accelerator (MRL) prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and to determine the association of degree of bladder filling with intra-fractional prostatic motion requiring positional shifts during therapy.
The impact of bladder filling on post-treatment target and normal tissue dosimetry was also evaluated.
