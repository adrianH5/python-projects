Schwannomas are myelin sheath tumours of peripheral nerve cells.
They are typically slow growing and benign but have a rare risk of malignant transformation.
Schwannomas mostly occur in the head and neck, spine or limbs.
Ileal schwannomas are extremely rare with limited description in the literature.A man in his 60s with lower urinary tract symptoms and visible haematuria was referred to a urologist by his general practitioner.
A benign-appearing lesion was identified on a CT of the kidneys, urinary tract and bladder (CTKUB), which was retrospectively identified 3 years earlier on a previous CTKUB.
The tumour was surgically excised and histologically diagnosed as a benign schwannoma.This case presents radiological evidence of slow progression and is one among only four ileal schwannomas found in men documented in English literature in the last 25 years.
With complete excision of benign ileal schwannomas, no cases of recurrence have been reported, suggesting patients can be safely discharged without routine surveillance.
