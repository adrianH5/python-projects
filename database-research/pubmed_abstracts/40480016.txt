Brain metastases (BM) represent a common complication in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations.
We aimed to characterize the BM incidence and its association with genetic subtypes, and to analyze treatment outcomes and prognostic factors in this patient population.
