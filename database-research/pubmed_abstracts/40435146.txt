Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved the overall survival of patients with many different types of cancer since they were first approved by the United States in 2011.
However, patients who are treated with ICIs can develop a variety of toxicities, known as immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAEs), that have the potential to affect essentially any organ system.
Due to the growing use of ICIs in the field of oncology, it is likely that non-oncologist clinicians will increasingly encounter irAEs in both inpatient and outpatient environments.
This review will provide an overview of both common and rare irAEs for the non-oncologist clinician, in addition to providing information about several guidelines developed by multiple organizations that can aid the non-oncologist clinician with the initial work-up and diagnosis of irAEs.
