Chemoimmunotherapy followed by immunotherapy maintenance is recommended as the standard treatment for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.
While capecitabine maintenance therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in these patients, data on the efficacy of combining capecitabine with immunotherapy maintenance remain limited.
This study compared the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with capecitabine maintenance therapy (Immu/Cape) versus immunotherapy maintenance alone (Immu) in patients with de novo metastatic NPC (dmNPC) who received first-line chemoimmunotherapy.
