Dietary guidelines recommend replacing saturated fatty acid with unsaturated fats, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Cohort studies do not suggest a clear benefit of higher intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids but, in contrast, higher circulating linoleic acid (LA) levels-reflective of dietary LA intake, are associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.
However, genetic variants in the fatty acid desaturase 1 gene (FADS1) may influence individual responses to plant-based fats.
We explored whether FADS1 variants influence the relationships of LA and Î±-linolenic acid (ALA) intakes and nut consumption with plasma phospholipid fatty acid profiles and type 2 diabetes risk in a large-scale cohort study and a randomized controlled trial.
