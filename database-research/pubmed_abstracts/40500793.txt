Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can greatly improve the survival rate of patients.
Plasma cfDNA methylation has been shown to have the potential to be a non-invasive method for diagnosing HCC.
However, the identified HCC plasma cfDNA methylation sites were less sensitive to early HCC diagnosis.
Therefore, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive marker panel based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation for the detection of HCC.
