Heparanase (HPSE) remodeling of the extracellular matrix makes it a crucial therapeutic target.
The development of effective glycan-based HPSE inhibitors has been limited by bleeding and thromboembolic disorders.
In this report, we present a structure-based design approach that rapidly generates a library of potent and selective HS mimetics, synthesized in 8 to 9 steps from readily available aminoglycoside tobramycin.
Computational analyses indicate that hydrophobic molecular markers modulate HPSE activity.
Consequently, we identified naphthalene-based
