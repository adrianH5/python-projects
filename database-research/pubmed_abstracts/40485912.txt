Brachytherapy requires precise applicator placement, especially in complex cases, where standard imaging may not provide sufficient guidance.
Virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a valuable tool for pre-simulation, enabling improved anatomical understanding and procedural planning.
We reported two cases, in which VR pre-simulation was used to enhance brachytherapy planning in challenging anatomical regions.
