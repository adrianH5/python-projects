The principal sensor of intracellular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CGAS), which generates the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP that binds stimulator of interferon genes (STING1), leading to the expression of type I interferon genes.
CGAS and STING1 also play essential roles in maintaining genome integrity and the initiation and progression of cancer.
Here we show that
