Schwannoma is the most common neurogenic tumor in the posterior mediastinum, however it is rarely found in the anterior mediastinum (Mediastinum 4, 2020; Radiat Med 13(4):175-7).
We report a large anterior mediastinal schwannoma causing cardiac compression along with a concurrent cervical spine lesion causing right-sided weakness.
Current literature having only a few case reports describing an anterior location for this neoplasm and even rarer to have a concurrent symptomatic cervical lesion.
We present this case to highlight this rare finding and increase awareness of this potential diagnosis.
