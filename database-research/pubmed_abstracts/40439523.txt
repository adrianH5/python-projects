Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one serious cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide.
Poor bioavailability and non-specific targeting of drugs is a challenge.
Gemcitabine (GEM) is broad-spectrum anticancer drug for liver and other cancers.
In this study, an attempt to formulate drug-loaded galactosylated albumin-based nanoparticles (GEM-LA-BSA NPs) was made to increase the bioavailability and targetability of hydrophilic drugs.
The formulation was optimized using central composite design for further evaluation and developed a pilot-scale approach for commercialization.
LA-BSA conjugate was synthesized, characterized, and formulated into a nanoformulation.
The particle size of the optimal formulation was 40.19 ± 7.98 nm with reduced drug release (57.78% ± 4.10%) in 48 h and aggregates-like structure by HR-TEM.
In vitro studies in HepG2 cells indicated better cytotoxicity of GEM-LA-BSA NPs than GEM (IC
