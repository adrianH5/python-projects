This collective eulogy by colleagues, co-authors and friends is a tribute to the work and life of Rudolf Nieuwenhuys.
'Neurofascination' is an apt label for his scholarly life in the sciences from the start in 1955 until his last days in 2024.
In addition, he had a broad interest in Roman and Gothic architecture, the history and politics of the twentieth century, religion and the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.
Extensive discussions on one or more of these topics often led to long-lasting friendships, some of which inform the following pages.
Rudolf is remembered for his highly didactical and remarkably illustrated presentations and publications, including the three-volume The Central Nervous System of Vertebrates and the four editions of The Human Central Nervous System.
His research interests addressed an impressively wide range of topics concerning development and evolutionary neurobiology and a systematic approach to comparative brain structures in vertebrates.
His almost endless fascination for neuromorphology included the invertebrates as well.
But unfortunately, even his long life was not enough to write the book on the comparative neuroanatomy of invertebrates which he long had in mind.
The many years of his career spanned the remarkable histology of the gigantocerebellum of mormyrids to an exploratory synthesis of subdivisions of the human cortex, as originally mapped by the Vogt-Vogt school of cortical architectonics.
