Digestive tract cancers are a common health concern worldwide.
In recent years, dysregulation of miRNA-590 in digestive tract malignancies has been extensively studied.
Alterations in its expression are related to clinical outcomes, such as tumor grade, patient prognosis, metastasis, recurrence, response to adjuvant therapy, and overall survival.
Therefore, miRNA-590 has the potential to serve as a candidate prognostic and diagnostic biomarker, as well as a therapeutic target.
In this study, we focus on the role of miRNA-590 in the biology of digestive tract cancers.
It has been shown that miRNA-590 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the tumor type, affecting growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
Additionally, we specifically discuss the downstream effects of miRNA-590 and its upstream regulators, as well as its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker and promising target for cancer therapy.
