HSP90 heat shock chaperones are essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis, as well as the ATP-dependent folding and functional maturation of many viral proteins.
As a result, inhibitors of HSP90 have broad antiviral activity, disrupting replication of many viruses at concentrations below those causing cytotoxicity.
Among the
