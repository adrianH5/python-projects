Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide.
In the present era of targeted therapy for various lung cancer mutations, it is essential to be aware of the imaging correlates of various lung cancer mutations on contrast enhanced computed tomography of thorax.
In this article, we have discussed the imaging patterns of various types of lung cancer including different mutations and also comprehensively reviewed the imaging recommendations (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], European Society of Medical Oncology [ESMO] and American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO]) and management guidelines of lung cancer (non-small cell, small cell and other neuroendocrine tumours).
We have also discussed guidelines for screening, diagnosis, staging (recent 9th edition tumour node metastasis [TNM]), treatment response evaluation, and follow up.
Role of interventional radiology in the treatment of primary lung cancer, lung metastasis, and management of posttreatment complications, have also been described in detail in this article.
In addition, current status of artificial intelligence in lung cancer has also been briefly discussed.
