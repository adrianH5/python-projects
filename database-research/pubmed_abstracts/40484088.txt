Unsatisfactory curative effects and low accumulation of chemotherapeutics at the target site are major limitations for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment.
Herein, a new polysaccharide with chemotherapy-sensitising activity was isolated from vinegar-baked Radix Bupleuri (VBRB), which was named VRP3-4.
It is a pectic polysaccharide with a molecular weight (Mw) of 14.38 kDa, composed of galacturonic acid (GalA), arabinose (Ara), rhamnose (Rha), and galactose (Gal) in a molar ratio of 76.89:11.51:7.18: 4.42.
The backbone of VRP3-4 is made up of 1, 4-linked-α-GalpA, a small fraction of 1, 3, 4-linked-α-GalpA and Rhap.
Additionally, 1, 5-linked-α-Araf is connected to O-3 of GalpA as a side chain, and it self-assembles into a nanoparticle in solution.
VRP3-4 significantly enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of methotrexate (MTX) on HCC cells by 59.37 % and increased its intracellular uptake by 1.90 times.
In vivo experiments indicated that VRP3-4 markedly enhanced the tumour inhibition of MTX.
Mechanism analysis revealed that the synergistic effect was achieved by downregulating the expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2).
Pull-down assay further indicated that VRP3-4 directly targeted BCRP and MRP2.
These findings identify a polysaccharide of VBRB as the potential HCC-targeting material to sensitise chemotherapeutics in HCC treatment.
