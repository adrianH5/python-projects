Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignancy of the head and neck, with recurrence and distant metastasis being the primary causes of mortality among affected patients.
Carcinoembryonic antigen cellular adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) are implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological processes.
However, the role of CEACAM7 in NPC progression remains unclear.
This study investigated the influence of CEACAM7 on NPC progression.
