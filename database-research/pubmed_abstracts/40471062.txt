This review explores the impact of community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections on outcomes before proceeding with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and chimeric-antigen-receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients and which conditions should be considered to delay or proceed with cell therapy.
It aims to assess current practices, the risks associated with early CARV infections in cell therapy recipients, and potential modifications to reduce complications and improve clinical outcomes if delay is not an option.
