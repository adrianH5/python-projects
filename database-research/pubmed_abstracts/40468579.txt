Researchers strive to develop more precise prediction models to understand smoking behaviors, facilitate tailored tobacco treatment and improve early detection of lung cancer, including the use of polygenic risk scores (PRS).
This study aimed to better understand participants' knowledge, interest and recommendations for receipt of PRS information.
Its specific aims were to (1) describe participants' knowledge and interest in obtaining PRS in the context of smoking behaviors, tobacco treatment and/or early detection of lung cancer and (2) identify patient-reported recommendations for incorporating genetic risk information into clinical care.
