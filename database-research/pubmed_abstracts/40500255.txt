G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic drug targets for a wide range of diseases.
Upon activation, GPCRs can initiate several signaling pathways, each with unique therapeutic implications.
Therefore, understanding how drugs selectively engage specific signaling pathways becomes paramount.
However, achieving this selectivity remains highly challenging.
To unravel the underlying multifaceted mechanisms, we integrate systematic mutagenesis of the CB
