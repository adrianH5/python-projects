The combination of immunotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nICT) or chemoradiotherapy (nICRT) represents a novel treatment approach for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LA-ESCC).
This study aimed to compare postoperative complications between patients who underwent esophagectomy directly and those who received surgery following neoadjuvant immunotherapy combining treatments (nIComT) including nICT or nICRT.
