Bladder cancer remains a significant clinical challenge, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.
Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive drug delivery systems in cancer therapy.
In this study, we introduce a novel treatment approach utilizing a ROS-responsive camptothecin (CPT) prodrug encapsulated within a chitosan nanocarrier, named CACPT.
Cinnamaldehyde (CA), acting as a ROS generator, forms thioketal bonds with CPT to create a prodrug that responds selectively to the elevated ROS levels within the tumor microenvironment.
Upon exposure to high ROS conditions, these thioketal bonds are cleaved, resulting in the simultaneous release of CPT and CA.
The liberated CA further enhances ROS production, establishing a positive feedback loop that amplifies the therapeutic effect.
The use of amphiphilic chitosan nanocarriers enhances the retention and penetration of the prodrug within bladder tissue, optimizing its therapeutic potential.
Our experimental findings demonstrate that this self-enhanced ROS-responsive release promotes increased cellular uptake and significantly enhances the anticancer efficacy of CACPT.
These results position CACPT as a promising candidate for intravesical therapy in bladder cancer, potentially overcoming current limitations in treatment options.
The innovative combination of ROS-responsive mechanisms and chitosan nanocarriers represents a paradigm shift in bladder cancer therapeutics, offering a multifaceted approach with substantial promise for clinical translation.
