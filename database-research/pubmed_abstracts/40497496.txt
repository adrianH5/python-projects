Epigenetic changes are implicated in development, repair, and physiology of postnatal skeletal muscle (SkM).
We generated methylomes for human myoblasts (SkM progenitor cells) and determined myoblast differentially methylated regions (DMRs) for comparison to the epigenomics and transcriptomics of diverse cell types.
Analyses were from global genomic and single-gene perspectives and included reporter gene assays.
One atypical finding was the association of promoter-adjacent hypermethylation in myoblasts with transcription turn-on, but at downmodulated levels, for certain genes (
