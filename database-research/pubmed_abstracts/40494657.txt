ObjectiveThe use of energy devices during surgery can cause the spread of surgical smoke into the operating room.
The concentration of smoke particles during laparoscopic surgery is higher than that during open surgery.
This study aimed to quantify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during laparoscopic surgery and evaluate the carcinogenic risks to healthcare workers, as the current relevant data are insufficient.MethodsThis prospective observational study collected and classified surgical smoke generated during laparoscopic surgery.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.ResultsMultiple types of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were generated during laparoscopic surgery.
The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations remained below the carcinogenic risk levels in both laparoscopic liver cancer surgery and rectal cancer resection procedures.ConclusionThe deposition pattern and concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generated during laparoscopic liver and rectal cancer resection surgeries in the human respiratory tract are different.
The potential toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the smoke to the health of healthcare workers should not be ignored.
