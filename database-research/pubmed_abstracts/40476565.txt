Recent studies have established a strong connection between gut microbiota and the tumor immune microenvironment.
Beetroot (BRT) has emerged as a promising functional food for cancer prevention and treatment, although its specific effects on breast cancer remain unclear.
This study investigates the impact of BRT on polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT)-induced breast cancer by examining the gut microbiome, metabolites, and immune responses.
Dietary supplementation of 80 g BRT powder per 1000 g of standard diet (8% w/w, 80 g per kg) significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-PyMT (FVB) mice, while simultaneously enhancing anti-tumor immunity.
16S rRNA sequencing revealed that BRT supplementation altered the gut microbiota, notably increasing the abundance of
