This study was designed to determine the care burden, health anxiety and depression levels of caregivers of patients with oncological surgery and the relationship between these variables.
A descriptive and correlational study was conducted with 162 caregivers of patients who underwent surgery due to cancer.
Data were collected using "Caregiver Identification Form", "The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale", "The Beck Depression Inventory", and "The Health Anxiety Inventory".
The caregivers had moderate and severe levels of caregiver burden (51.79 ± 13.53), depression (17.27 ± 9.58), and health anxiety (26.44 ± 8.93).
There was a statistically significant positive weak relationship between the caregivers' health anxiety caregiver burden and depression levels.
It was determined that the caregivers of the patients also have needs like the patients.
It is necessary to understand what the caregiver is going through at every stage of the cancer patient's treatment process.
Planning a holistic care that includes the patient's caregivers will improve the well-being of the caregiver while also contributing to the development of the well-being of the patient receiving care.
