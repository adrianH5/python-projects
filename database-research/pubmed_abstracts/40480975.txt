The liver's regenerative ability depends on injury extent.
Minor injuries are repaired by hepatocyte self-duplication, while severe damage triggers cholangiocyte involvement in hepatocyte recovery.
This paradigm is well-documented for adult animals but is less explored during rapid growth.
We design two partial liver injury models in zebrafish, which were investigated during growth spurts: 1) partial ablation, killing half the hepatocytes; and 2) partial hepatectomy, removing half a liver lobe.
In both injuries, de novo hepatocytes emerged alongside existing ones.
Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing with Cre-driver lines generated by genome editing identified cholangiocytes as the source of de novo hepatocytes.
We further identify active mTORC1 signalling in the uninjured liver of growing animal to be a regulator of the enhanced plasticity of cholangiocytes.
Our study suggests cholangiocyte-to-hepatocyte transdifferentiation as the primary mechanism of liver regeneration during periods of rapid growth.
