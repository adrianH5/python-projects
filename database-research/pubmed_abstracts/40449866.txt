Demethoxycurcumin (DMC) has demonstrated remarkable anti-cancer properties across various tumor types.
However, its efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been established.
Interestingly, the type of cell death induced by DMC was distinct from traditional pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, cuproptosis, and autophagy, indicating a need for further detailed exploration of its mechanisms.
Our investigations revealed that DMC treatment led to a marked increase in oxidative stress, as evidenced by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
This increase in ROS disrupted the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, impairing mitochondrial respiration.
Additionally, ROS activation markedly reduced the rate of aerobic glycolysis by interfering with key glycolytic enzymes.
The resultant inhibition of these bioenergetic pathways led to a significant depletion of ATP.
Moreover, DMC activated the ATF4/ATF3/CHOP signaling axis, and the reduction of CHOP levels mitigated the cytotoxic effects of DMC in HCC cells.
In conclusion, DMC initiated oxidative stress, which disrupted bioenergetic metabolism and activated the ATF4/ATF3/CHOP signaling pathway, ultimately leading to cell death in HCC cells.
These findings suggest that DMC might have a potential role in the treatment of HCC.
However, further validation through in vivo models and clinical trials is required to confirm the therapeutic potential of DMC against HCC.
Moreover, more work is still needed to further explore the specific form of cell death induced by DMC.
