Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine-metabolic disease in women of reproductive age.
One of its core pathologies is ovarian granulosa cell (GC) dysfunction, and ferroptosis, as a novel cell death mode dependent on iron ions and lipid peroxidation, may be involved in the PCOS process, but the exact mechanism is unknown.
Plumbagin (PLB) shows potential in PCOS treatment due to its antioxidant properties.
The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PLB ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in PCOS GCs through the YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1/L-type amino acid transporter 1 (YTHDF1/SLC7A5) axis.
