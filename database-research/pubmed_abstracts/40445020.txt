Polymeric nanoparticles are extremely valuable carriers for drug/gene delivery to treat cancer, as they can protect different therapeutic agents during blood circulation while being able to deliver them at desired locations.
Owing to the versatility of polymers, it is possible to fine-tune the performance of nanocarriers by changing different properties, such as chemical structure, architecture, composition and molecular weight or even by functionalising the polymers with targeting molecules.
The use of pH-sensitive polymers is a very popular strategy to prepare smart carriers, taking advantage of the acidic intratumoural environment to induce hydrophobic/hydrophilic transitions that allow fast and efficient release of small drugs or genetic material.
This review summarizes the contributions of the use of promising pH-sensitive poly(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDPA), with p
