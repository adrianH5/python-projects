External hemipelvectomy (EH) is a complex amputation that removes the hemipelvis and leg, most commonly performed to resect a locally advanced pelvic malignancy.
This destabilizes the spinopelvic anatomy and may result in a compensatory scoliosis (CS) to maintain an upright posture.
We hypothesized pelvic ring reconstruction with vascularized bone (VB) will reduce CS and improve functional outcomes.
