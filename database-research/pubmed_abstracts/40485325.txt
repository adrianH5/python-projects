Cytarabine (Ara-C) is a cornerstone of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treatment, particularly in consolidation therapy.
Although high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) has been widely adopted for consolidation in AML, intermediate-dose cytarabine (IDAC) is increasingly favoured due to its comparable efficacy and improved tolerability.
However, the potential benefit of combining another agent with IDAC during consolidation therapy has yet to be adequately validated.
