Younger women are diagnosed more often with aggressive breast cancer (BC) subtypes, the treatment of which usually incorporates chemotherapy.
Physical training plays a significant role in mitigating the adverse effects of systemic cancer therapy, improving quality of life, and potentially enhancing treatment efficacy.
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) emerged as a promising intervention to counteract the fatigue induced by chemotherapy, which in younger women often causes depression and disruption of employment.
This study aimed to investigate whether supervised HIIT employed concurrently with chemotherapy impacts the cardiorespiratory fitness of young BC patients.
