Drug resistance and relapse are still major challenges in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of the inability to effectively eradicate leukemia stem cells (LSCs).
Senescence induction combined with immune killing may offer promising strategies for LSC eradication.
However, whether and how drug-resistant LSCs retain stemness via senescence and immune regulation remains unknown.
