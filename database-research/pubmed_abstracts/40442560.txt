We report two cases of pancreatic abscesses identified at autopsy.
Case 1 involved a male in his 70s with pancreatic head cancer and liver metastasis.
He died after 9 months despite chemotherapy.
Autopsy revealed gastric ulcer perforation and pancreatic abscess.
Case 2 involved a male in his 70s with locally advanced pancreatic head cancer.
He also died after 9 months despite undergoing chemotherapy.
Autopsy revealed a pancreatic abscess and adjacent gastric cellulitis.
The clinical progression was consistent with cancer-related death in both cases, but the autopsy revealed pancreatic abscesses as a contributing factor.
These cases highlight the importance of infection prevention during chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.
