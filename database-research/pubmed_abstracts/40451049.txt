Obesity and pregnancy are risk factors for difficult intubation.
A head-elevating positioning device increases functional residual capacity and improves direct laryngoscopy.
It is unclear what effect such device has on the airway anatomy.
The primary aim of this study was to determine the change in distance from the sternal notch to the cricothyroid membrane (CTM) mid-point among pregnant women with class 3 obesity, comparing the supine positioning and the head-elevated position.
