Commonly used digital health technologies, such as electronic health record systems and patient portals as well as custom-built digital decision aids, have the potential to enhance person-centered shared decision-making (SDM) in cancer care.
SDM is a 2-way exchange of information between at least a clinician and the patient and a shared commitment to make informed decisions.
However, there is little evidence in the literature on how technologies are used for SDM or how best they can be designed and integrated into workflows and practice.
This may be due to the nature of SDM, which is fundamentally human interactions and conversations that produce desired human outcomes.
Therefore, technology must be nonintrusive while supporting the human decision-making process.
