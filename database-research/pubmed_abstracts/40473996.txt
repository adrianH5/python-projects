Targeting lactate metabolism represents a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.
In this study, we developed a novel model based on lactate metabolism-related genes (LRGs) to predict survival, characterize the immune microenvironment, and assess immunotherapy response in gastric cancer (GC), with the potential to identify new biomarkers.
