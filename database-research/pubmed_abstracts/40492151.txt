Rational design and exploitation of nanomaterials with superior treatment properties for suitable indications is a way out to relieve cost constraint of therapy and solve the unsatisfactory efficacy for cancer patients.
In this work, in order solve the current bottleneck problems of photothermal therapy (PTT) with longer light excitation as well as synergistic eactive oxygen species (ROS) storm mediating
