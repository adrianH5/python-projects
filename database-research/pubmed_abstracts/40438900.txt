Although radiation oncologists obtain non-contrast computed tomography (CT) images in every treatment, their quality is often insufficient for radiomic analyses for monitoring response over the course of treatment.
Newer linear accelerators, such as RefleXion X1, have higher-quality imaging, creating new opportunities for radiomic analysis throughout treatment.
