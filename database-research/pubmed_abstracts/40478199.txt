Steatotic liver disease (SLD) is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting 30% of the global population.
It is strongly associated with the interplay of genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors.
The genetic variant accounting for the largest fraction of SLD heritability is PNPLA3 I148M, which is carried by 23% of the western population and increases the risk of SLD two to three-fold.
However, identification of variant carriers is not part of routine clinical care and prevents patients from receiving personalised care.
