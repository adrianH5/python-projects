This study aims to develop a pH-responsive nanosuspension for localized cancer therapy by integrating photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT).
Initially, we synthesized a compound containing two five-membered cyclic orthoester bonds (OE) as a liquid pharmaceutical excipient.
This OE was subsequently coloaded with the photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) and iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe
