The human double minute 2 homolog hdm2, alias mdm2, is the main negative-regulator of the tumor suppressor p53.
In that capacity, mdm2 is a promising but not yet utilized molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer, however, its inhibition by small molecules is rather inappropriate.
Instead, mdm2 degradation by PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) is expected to be highly specific, to exhibit pronounced efficiency and minimal side effects.
Moreover, there is profound evidence that mdm2-specific PROTAC degraders are efficient even in tumor cells harboring p53 loss-of-function mutations.
