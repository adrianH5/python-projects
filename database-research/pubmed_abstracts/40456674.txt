Nuclear medicine has seen significant advancements in recent years, especially in the area of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.
One of these innovations is the use of Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitors (FAPI) as a novel radiotracer.
FAPI PET imaging has shown promising results in various malignancies, including sarcomas, which are a diverse group of cancers originating from mesenchymal cells.
This review aims to explore the potential of FAPI PET imaging in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring of sarcomas.
Several studies have demonstrated the potential of FAPI PET in sarcomas.
Furthermore, FAPI PET imaging has shown potential in assessing treatment response, with changes in FAPI uptake correlating with treatment outcomes.
However, there are challenges to be addressed.
The heterogeneity of sarcomas, both inter- and intra-tumoral, may affect the uniformity of Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) expression and thus the effectiveness of FAPI PET imaging.
In conclusion, the introduction of FAPI PET imaging represents a significant advancement in the field of nuclear medicine and oncology.
As we continue to deepen our understanding of this novel imaging technique, it is hoped that FAPI PET imaging will play an increasingly important role in the fight against cancer.
However, as with any new technology, further research is needed to fully understand the potential and limitations of FAPI PET imaging in the clinical setting.
