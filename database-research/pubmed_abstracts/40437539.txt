Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign, locally aggressive bone lesions that commonly affect young adults and adolescents.
These cysts, which may cause pain, fractures, or deformities, are often associated with vascular or abnormal bone resorption processes.
Though their etiology is not fully understood, an intriguing and rarely discussed correlation between aneurysmal bone cysts and endocrine disorders, particularly primary hyperparathyroidism, has been reported.
Hyperparathyroidism, usually resulting from a parathyroid adenoma, promotes osteoclastic activity, which can lead to bone resorption and potentially the formation of aneurysmal cysts.
The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism can be challenging, especially in the absence of characteristic clinical signs.
