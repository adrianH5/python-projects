20-30% of newly diagnosed Acute myeloid leukemia(AML) patients fail to achieve complete response (CR) following intensive induction chemotherapy.
This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reinduction regimens in improving CR rates among newly diagnosed AML patients who did not achieve partial response(PR) after initial intensive induction therapy.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 175 newly diagnosed AML patients aged 18-60 years, treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University between January 2020 and March 2024.
Patients who did not achieve PR after first line inductive therapy were switched to alternative intensive chemotherapy regimens or regimens including venetoclax and azacitidine.
After the first induction cycle, the overall response rate(ORR) was 82.8%.
For patients with no response, early replacement of reinduction regimens, especially those containing venetoclax, led to an ORR of 90.2% after two cycles of induction therapy.
We recommend that young patients with newly diagnosed AML be primarily treated with DA/IA induction therapy.
For those who fail to achieve remission, early replacement of re-induction therapy enhances the therapeutic efficacy of newly diagnosed young adult AML.
