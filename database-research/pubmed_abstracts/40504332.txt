This study investigates the role of HSPB1 in pancreatic cancer, particularly its impact on cell proliferation and migration through ferroptosis regulation and interaction with TP53 MATERIALS AND METHODS: HSPB1 expression was analyzed using BioGPS and GEPIA databases.
BxPC-3 cell lines with stable HSPB1 overexpression and knockdown were created via plasmid transfection and siRNA.
The study examined HSPB1's effect on TP53 protein levels and its role in ferroptosis using TP53 agonists and inhibitors.
