Preoperative diagnosis of muscle invasion and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage plays a crucial role in guiding treatment strategies for bladder cancer (BCa).
Utilizing quantitative analysis of tumor subregions via CT imaging holds promise in identifying high-risk populations.
Developing and evaluating the performance of an unsupervised clustering algorithm-based intratumoral subregion radiomics model for distinguishing between bladder muscle invasion and AJCC stage.
