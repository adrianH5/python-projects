Base editors, including adenine base editors (ABEs) and cytosine base editors (CBEs), are widely used in numerous organisms to introduce site-specific sequence modifications in genomic DNA without causing double-strand breaks (DSBs).
However, these editors exhibit low editing efficiencies, particularly in dicot plants, thereby limiting their application in dicot plant genome engineering.
In this study, we assessed the editing efficiencies of various base editors to identify those optimal for base editing in dicot plants.
We discovered that ABE8e, an ABE variant, demonstrated superior A-to-G base editing efficiency within A5-A8 windows, and A3A/Y130F-V04, a CBE variant, exhibited the highest C-to-T base editing efficiency within C4-C15 windows in both Arabidopsis and soybean protoplasts.
Overall, we recommend these two base editors as prime choices for efficient genome engineering in a range of crop plants.
