Treatment of breast cancer (BC) remains to face clinical challenges due to poor tumor penetration of therapeutic agents, which is a direct consequence of the high content of hyaluronan (HA) within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tumor tissues.
Herein, we reported the synthesis of phototherapy liposomes which integrated hyaluronidase (HAase) conjugated with a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) responsive peptide in their phospholipid membrane, and preloaded with indocyanine green (ICG), CaO
