Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) is characterized as a distressing, persistent, and subjective sensation of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive exhaustion that is associated with cancer or its treatment.
CRF is commonly observed in patients with cancer and a severely impairing symptom also in patients with the rare primary central nervous lymphoma (PCNSL).
While its exact etiology remains unclear, elevated levels of tumor-induced inflammatory cytokines are believed to contribute to its development.
Transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive method to activate the vagal nerve through electrical stimulation of a vagally innervated area at the tragus.
It has shown to modulate the immunsystem, to activate central arousal pathways and to reduce fatigue in autoimmune conditions.
In this study, the effect of taVNS on the fatigue syndrome in patients with PCNSL will be investigated.
