Overexpression or gene mutation of SHP2 is closely linked with a variety of cancers and has been identified as a crucial anticancer target.
The fluorescent molecules have the potential for promoting novel SHP2 inhibitors development by visualizing its tissue distribution and biological behavior information.
In the work, we designed and synthesized a series of imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole derivatives.
Among them, several imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activities against SHP2.
The representative compound 4q demonstrated significant potency against SHP2 with IC
