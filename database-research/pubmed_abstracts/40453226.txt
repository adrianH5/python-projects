Diagnostic quality MRI acquired daily for radiotherapy (RT) planning on an MR-linac allows longitudinal evaluation of the patients' anatomy.
This study investigated changes in prostate volume during MR-guided RT.
The changes were assessed from manual delineations used clinically for daily online adaptation as well as automated segmentation by artificial intelligence (AI).
The consistency and congruity of these two methods were evaluated.
