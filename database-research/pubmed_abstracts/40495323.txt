Following the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in other cancer types, their role is being evaluated in sarcomas.
They have been assessed as monotherapy, or in combination with other ICI, chemotherapeutic drugs and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in several clinical trials.
So far the results have been limited to non-selected sarcoma populations.
Further work is required to select patients who will benefit from immunotherapy.
