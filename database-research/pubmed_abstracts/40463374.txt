Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a potential target for autoimmune disease therapies.
The gut microbiota plays a critical role in autoimmunity, and may influence therapeutic outcomes of immune therapies in cancer.
However, the relationship between PD-L1 and gut microbiota in autoimmune conditions remains unclear.
This study aims to investigate the effect of PD-L1 knockout on gut microbiota in an experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model.
