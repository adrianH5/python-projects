Group IV metal oxides have a broad impact on the environment and human health due to their diverse applications in industry, consumer products and biomedicine.
However, their chemical inertness poses significant challenges for accurate quantification in biological matrices, which is essential for assessing biodistribution, toxicity, and regulatory compliance.
Traditional digestion methods often rely on hydrofluoric acid (HF), a hazardous reagent requiring specialized handling and infrastructure.
Here, we present an alternative, HF-free microwave assisted digestion protocol for group IV metal oxides in biological contexts, utilizing sulfuric acid/water/hydrogen peroxide mixtures to achieve complete solubilization across nano-to microscale particles.
The method's efficacy was evaluated on various commercially available TiO
