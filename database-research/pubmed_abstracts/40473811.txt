Bladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the urinary tract.
In this study, 90 lupane triterpene derivatives, previously synthesized in the laboratory, were systematically evaluated for their potential effects against bladder cancer by cytotoxicity screening against five urinary tumor cell lines.
Bioinformatics and molecular dynamics methods were used to investigate the mechanism of action of compound 27 in depth.
Most of the derivatives effectively inhibited tumor cell growth, and structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that introducing an indole moiety significantly enhanced the biological activity.
The peak activity was reached when the dibromoalkyl chain length was C = 5 (IC
