Posttraumatic growth (PTG), defined as positive psychological changes following traumatic events, has been observed in some hematological cancer patients during their disease course.
These changes, encompassing shifts in life perspective, interpersonal relationships, and self-perception, are critical for psychological recovery.
However, the interplay of social support, coping strategies, anxiety, and depression in shaping PTG remains unclear.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore these associations in hematological cancer patients using a hypothetical model.
