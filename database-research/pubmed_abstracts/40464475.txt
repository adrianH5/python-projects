Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare disease with a high disability rate, characterized by acute-to-subacute psychiatric and/or neurological symptoms.
Continuous intrathecal antibody synthesis does not correlate with the active phase of encephalitis and antibody titers do not directly reflect the severity of the condition.
Currently, there is a lack of biomarkers for disease monitoring.
This study focuses on finding novel peripheral blood biomarkers that can accurately monitor the severity of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
