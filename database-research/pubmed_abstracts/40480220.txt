Bacteria engineered to express tumor antigens as cancer vaccines have produced mixed results.
Here, we used an attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes (Î”actA, Lm) that lacks tumor antigens to examine the immune response to Lm itself in tumor-bearing mice following intravenous (i.v.
), intratumoral (i.t.
), or combined i.v.
+ i.t.
Lm delivery.
Unexpectedly, i.t.
Lm alone recruited neutrophils to tumors, which became immunosuppressive, provided an intracellular reservoir for long-term persistence of Lm in tumors, and promoted tumor growth.
In contrast, prior i.v.
Lm administration generated anti-Lm cytotoxic CD8
