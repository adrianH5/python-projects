Validation of threshold-based PET segmentation and PET quantification is typically performed with fillable phantoms.
Theoretical considerations show that the inactive walls of the phantom cavities introduce a contrast dependence of the volume-reproducing threshold (VRT), potentially leading to segmentation errors and therefore miscalculations of target volumes.
The goal of this study was to experimentally show the contrast independence of the VRT when using wall-less phantoms.
