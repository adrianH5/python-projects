Leukemia, a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies, poses significant challenges in terms of early diagnosis and effective treatment.
Recent advancements in nanotechnology have paved the way for innovative approaches in leukemia management, with a particular focus on IONPs.
This review paper explores the diverse designs of IONPs and their multifaceted applications in the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.
Focused discussions on the synergistic combination of IONPs with conventional chemotherapy, targeted drug delivery, and hyperthermia-based approaches provide insights into the evolving landscape of IONP-mediated leukemia therapy.
The role of IONPs in overcoming drug resistance mechanisms and minimizing off-target effects is critically evaluated.
The later review section provides an overview of the unique physical, chemical, and magnetic properties of IONPs, emphasizing their biocompatibility, tunable magnetic properties, and surface functionalization capabilities.
The review finally addresses the challenges and prospects associated with the clinical translation of IONP-based diagnostic approaches.
By addressing the challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field, this paper aims to guide future research endeavors toward the development of effective and personalized nanotherapeutics for leukemia patients.
