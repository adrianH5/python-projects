The Care Hotel is a virtual medicine hybrid model of care implemented at the Mayo Clinic to increase use of enhanced recovery protocols, address hospital capacity and reduce medical costs.
This voluntary accommodation offers patients a comfortable environment to receive nursing care postoperatively with in-person daytime monitoring and 24-hour virtual telemonitoring in a hotel setting.
This study aims to evaluate postoperative outcomes in patients admitted to the Care Hotel after mastectomy with immediate tissue expander reconstruction compared to standard overnight admission.
