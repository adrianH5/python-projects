The NRF2 signaling pathway promotes tumor initiation, progression and resistance to chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
The mechanisms underlying the biology of NRF2-active tumors are varied, and include altered cellular metabolism, a reductive shift in redox state, and immunosuppression.
Here we determined the molecular and phenotypic impact of NRF2 activation on two human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell models.
