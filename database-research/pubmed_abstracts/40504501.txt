Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening condition.
Although pulmonary vasodilators have shown promise in managing PAH, the improvement in prognosis is modest, partly because of a lack of biomarkers to guide their selection.
Herein, we aimed to identify molecular-based predictors of responsiveness to pulmonary vasodilators using clinical and preclinical investigations.
