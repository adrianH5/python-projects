Near infrared (NIR) aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-based luminogens are emerging as powerful materials with significant potential in cancer diagnosis, imaging, and therapy applications.
Of precise note are the rapidly progressing areas in the field encompassing deep-tissue imaging, resistance to photobleaching, and biomedicine.
Unlike traditional aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) fluorophores, AIE materials with NIR emissive features can revolutionize the broad transdisciplinary areas of biomedicine, therapy, and healing, making them highly effective for real-time monitoring and healthcare purposes.
In this study, we have synthesized a (
