Panax quinquefolium, also known as American ginseng, is a perennial herb in the Araliaceae family.
It has the effects of replenishing Qi and nourishing Yin, clearing heat and generating saliva.
Additionally, it has protective effects on the nerves, improves myocardial ischemia and hypoxia, regulates metabolism, enhances the body's immunity, and is known as &quot;green gold&quot;.
However, with the development of the industry and the expansion of planting scales, P. quinquefolium faces serious disease issues that are difficult to prevent and control.
Among these, root rot, often referred to as &quot;plant cancer&quot;, is one of the most destructive plant diseases affecting the yield and quality of P. quinquefolium.
P. quinquefolium root rot is caused by the fungi Fusarium(genus) and Ilyonectria(genus), which severely affect the root system and limit the production and quality of P. quinquefolium, thus restricting the development of the P. quinquefolium industry.
In recent years, research on P. quinquefolium root rot has attracted significant attention and made some progress.
However, the mechanisms of interaction between the root rot pathogens and the host plant remain unclear.
This paper reviews the research progress on the pathogens, infection cycle, disease prevalence, pathogenesis, and biological control of P. quinquefolium root rot to provide prospects for future research, aiming to provide references for the in-depth study and effective control of root rot, and to promote the green and healthy development of the P. quinquefolium industry.
