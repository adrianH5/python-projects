Palliative care (PC) is an essential, effective, and affordable component of health care.
Global need is rising, with the greatest burden in low-and-middle-income countries.
This is especially true in Nigeria where the need is growing rapidly, as are PC services; however, current organizational models have not yet been examined.
This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study of five PC sites at tertiary hospitals in four of Nigeria's six geopolitical zones.
Surveys, informed by a Centre for Palliative Care, Nigeria (CPCN) needs assessment checklist and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), were administered at each site to leadership, frontline workers, patients, and caregivers.
Surveys varied by participant group and inquired about organizational models and personal experiences of both providers and recipients of care.
Across five sites, there was a total of 282 survey respondents: five leaders, nine frontline workers, 132 patients, and 136 caregivers.
The most common diagnoses of PC patients were cancer, sickle cell disease, and HIV.
Most sites reported sub-optimal administrative support (80%), hospital management support (60%), and building space (60%).
Leadership responses highlighted variations in PC training requirements and opportunities.
Frontline workers desired additional training, sponsorship, and governmental support.
Most patients and their caregivers reported satisfaction with PC, though high levels of worry and hopelessness were reported.
Increased organizational support appears necessary to facilitate improvements in administrative resources, staffing, and training.
Emotional and spiritual wellbeing likely require prioritization when designing palliative care delivery services in Nigeria.
Further research is needed to refine current services and inform implementation efforts.
