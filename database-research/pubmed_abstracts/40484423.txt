Breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) at the arm and/or trunk/breast is a highly feared complication following breast cancer treatment and can be objectified using the state-of-the-art criteria based on volume, extracellular water ratio or skin thickness measurements.
Although the incidence of objective BCRL is decreasing due to advances in breast cancer treatment, many patients report a sensation of swelling without the presence of objective BCRL, referred to as subjective BCRL.
As little is known about the prevalence and the transitions between different BCRL states (no-subjective-objective) over time, as well as about the underlying mechanisms and contributing factors of subjective BCRL, this will be investigated in the LymphSens study.
