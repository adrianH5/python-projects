Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common cancer associated with elevated mortality rates.
Exosomes, diminutive extracellular vesicles, significantly contribute to tumour development, immunological evasion, and treatment resistance.
Identifying exosome-associated biomarkers in HNSCC may improve early diagnosis, treatment targeting, and patient classification.
