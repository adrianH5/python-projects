Medication abortion (MAB) accounts for an increasing proportion of in-clinic abortions in the United States and poses unique considerations for provision of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).
Studies of LARC initiation among MAB patients mostly consist of trials where financial barriers to LARC were removed.
We sought to identify correlates of LARC initiation post-MAB in a community-based setting.
