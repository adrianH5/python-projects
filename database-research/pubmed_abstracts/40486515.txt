The combination of anti-angiogenic agents, PD-1/L1 inhibitors, and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has emerged as an important strategy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), yet comparative data on efficacy and safety between different anti-angiogenic agents (lenvatinib [LenHAP] or bevacizumab [BevHAP]) remain lacking, especially in patients with potential resectable features (PotenR).
