Netupitant 300 mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg (NEPA) would be ideal as antiemetic prophylaxis for patients receiving weekly cisplatin, as it would reduce concurrent medication intake compared to the 3-day aprepitant regimen.
However, due to the longer half-life of netupitant (~ 88 h), weekly administration could potentially lead to accumulation and toxicity.
This study aims to investigate the safety and antiemetic efficacy of weekly administration of NEPA plus dexamethasone (DEX) in patients treated for cervical cancer with radiotherapy and weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m
