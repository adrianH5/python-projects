Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a virally mediated condition of benign vocal fold growths caused by the human papillomavirus.
It is known that systemic immunosuppression, as seen in cancer or transplant patients, can lead to proliferation of the virus and worsening of disease burden.
However, it is unknown whether systemic corticosteroids, which can promote a state of transient immunosuppression, can cause a similar effect.
Corticosteroids are frequently used during and after microlaryngoscopic surgery to reduce laryngeal edema and inflammation, but no literature supports or argues against using them.
We set out to determine the prevailing attitudes of otolaryngologists towards the use of steroids in RRP.
