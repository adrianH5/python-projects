Patients with advanced cancer often experience disease- and treatment-related pain.
Previous studies have shown that music therapy can help manage pain.
The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of a live-music therapy protocol, delivered by a trained music therapist, to induce relaxation in patients, allowing for real-time patient management and tailored sessions.
