Cancer-associated thrombosis is a significant health care problem.
It is often challenging to balance the risks of recurrent thrombosis and treatment-related bleeding in this patient population, requiring individualized treatment decisions because of its complicated clinical course.
There have been significant advances in the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis over last 5 years based on data from randomized clinical trials.
However, knowledge gaps still exist such as effective risk prediction of recurrent cancer-associated thrombosis and treatment-related bleeding using biomarkers or clinical variables.
This narrative article review discusses the pertinent risk factors and summarizes the main treatment domains in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism and potential future directions.
