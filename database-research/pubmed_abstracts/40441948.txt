Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and radical cystectomy (RC) are often older, frail and deconditioned, leaving them with limited reserve to endure the demands of treatment.
As a result, improving physical fitness in this population remains a critical need.
Two emerging means to do so include the implementation of exercise programs pre- and postsurgery (i.e.
(p)rehabilitation), and the use of digital health technologies (i.e.
Fitbit®, Apple Watch™, exercise apps) to incentivize physical activity.
However, little is known about the motivations of NAC/RC patients to be active or their perceptions towards digital health technologies.
