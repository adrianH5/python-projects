Over the past decade, immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment algorithm for solid tumors.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) demonstrated efficacy against several tumor types, but they can favor the development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
IrAEs can sometimes be life-threatening.
In this review, we will briefly analyze the main gastro-intestinal toxicities and focus on potential strategies for mitigating irAEs, particularly through the modification of gut microbiota (GM) composition.
Finally, we will briefly dwell on the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the prediction of irAEs.
