Myxoid liposarcomas (MLS) are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors characterized by specific translocations t(12;16) and t(12;22) with limited additional driver mutations, most notably in PIK3CA and the TERT promoter.
PIK3CA is considered a promising therapeutic target.
However, effective treatments require the uniform presence of mutation throughout the tumor.
Therefore, this study evaluated intratumoral heterogeneity of driver mutations in MLS.
