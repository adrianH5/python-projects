Locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) is a more severe subtype of BCC, characterized by large, deeply invasive tumors that often occur in cosmetically or functionally sensitive areas.
Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the standard treatment, offering high cure rates through layer-by-layer excision with microscopic margin control.
However, MMS alone may not entirely prevent recurrence in aggressive or infiltrative subtypes.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive treatment modality that may enhance outcomes when used adjunctively.
This study evaluated whether combining MMS with PDT offers advantages over MMS alone for laBCC.
