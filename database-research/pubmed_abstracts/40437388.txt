Actin remodeling plays important roles in pathophysiological processes such as cancer metastasis and angiogenesis.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules thought to regulate cell migration by remodeling actin cytoskeleton.
Earlier, we demonstrated that Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channels mediates H
