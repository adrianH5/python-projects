Fermented black ginseng (FBG) is gaining attention for its enhanced pharmacological properties and health benefits.
However, traditional processing of black ginseng (BG) can produce benzo(a)pyrene, a potential carcinogen.
This study introduces a novel Light-Emitting Diode (LED) technique to produce benzo(a)pyrene-free FBG, ensuring both safety and efficacy.
The LED system enables energy-efficient drying and optimized light conditions for fermentation, preserving bioactive compounds while preventing benzo(a)pyrene formation.
A controlled fermentation environment was achieved by optimizing LED parameters and drying efficiency.
Additionally, the therapeutic potential of FBG, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities, was evaluated against conventional BG and FBG.
This study highlights LED technology as an innovative approach for producing high-quality, safe FBG with enhanced bioactivity including antioxidant, anti-lung cancer and anti-inflammatory activities, offering new possibilities for nutraceutical, functional food, and therapeutic applications.
