Commonly occurring oncogenic mutations in EGFR render non-small cell lung cancers sensitive to approved EGFR-targeted drugs.
EGFR in-frame exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutants are, however, less sensitive to such drugs.
The efficacy of existing medicines may in part be limited by their selectivity for ex20ins mutations relative to wild-type EGFR, which is important for epithelial tissue homeostasis.
