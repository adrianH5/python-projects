Background MRI protocols typically involve many imaging sequences and often require too much time.
Purpose To simulate artificial intelligence (AI)-directed stratified scanning for screening breast MRI with various triage thresholds and evaluate its diagnostic performance against that of the full breast MRI protocol.
Materials and Methods This retrospective reader study included consecutive contrast-enhanced screening breast MRI examinations performed between January 2013 and January 2019 at three regional cancer sites.
In this simulation study, an in-house AI tool generated a suspicion score for subtraction maximum intensity projection images during a given MRI examination, and the score was used to determine whether to proceed with the full MRI protocol or end the examination early (abbreviated breast MRI [AB-MRI] protocol).
Examinations with suspicion scores under the 50th percentile were read using both the AB-MRI protocol (ie, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans only) and the full MRI protocol.
Diagnostic performance metrics for screening with various AI triage thresholds were compared with those for screening without AI triage.
Results Of 863 women (mean age, 52 years ± 10 [SD]; 1423 MRI examinations), 51 received a cancer diagnosis within 12 months of screening.
The diagnostic performance metrics for AI-directed stratified scanning that triaged 50% of examinations to AB-MRI versus full MRI protocol scanning were as follows: sensitivity, 88.2% (45 of 51; 95% CI: 79.4, 97.1) versus 86.3% (44 of 51; 95% CI: 76.8, 95.7); specificity, 80.8% (1108 of 1372; 95% CI: 78.7, 82.8) versus 81.4% (1117 of 1372; 95% CI: 79.4, 83.5); positive predictive value 3 (ie, percent of biopsies yielding cancer), 23.6% (43 of 182; 95% CI: 17.5, 29.8) versus 24.7% (42 of 170; 95% CI: 18.2, 31.2); cancer detection rate (per 1000 examinations), 31.6 (95% CI: 22.5, 40.7) versus 30.9 (95% CI: 21.9, 39.9); and interval cancer rate (per 1000 examinations), 4.2 (95% CI: 0.9, 7.6) versus 4.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 8.6).
Specificity decreased by no more than 2.7 percentage points with AI triage.
There were no AI-triaged examinations for which conducting the full MRI protocol would have resulted in additional cancer detection.
Conclusion AI-directed stratified MRI decreased simulated scan times while maintaining diagnostic performance.
