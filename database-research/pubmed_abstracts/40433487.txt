There is evidence to support several modes of action (MoAs), and particularly non-genotoxic MoAs, for mesothelioma induced by asbestiform elongate mineral particles (EMPs).
In turn, these MoAs provide biological support for dose-response relationships that are non-linear and that include a threshold.
However, statistical models of human data have not adequately addressed threshold dose-response relationships for asbestiform EMPs and mesothelioma.
In addition, unlike other carcinogens, asbestiform EMPs are not uniform materials and display a range of properties.
