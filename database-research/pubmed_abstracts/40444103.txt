Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children aged 0-14 years.
Despite significant efforts, targeted therapies based on identified pathways have not improved survival rates.
Research has shown that the gut microbiota (GM) can influence brain tumor cell proliferation, suggesting that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a role in CNS cancer.
Our study aims to assess whether the GM composition in pediatric CNS tumors exhibits specific characteristics.
