Recent research advances have resulted in an experimental benchtop X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT) system that likely meets the imaging dose/scan time constraints for benchtop XFCT imaging of live mice injected with gold nanoparticles (GNPs).
For routine in vivo benchtop XFCT imaging, however, additional challenges, most notably the need for rapid/near-real-time handling of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) signal extraction and XFCT image reconstruction, must be successfully addressed.
Here we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework that integrates a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) for rapid XRF signal extraction with a U-Net model for XFCT image reconstruction.
We trained the models using a comprehensive dataset including experimentally-acquired and augmented XRF/scatter photon spectra from various GNP concentrations and imaging scenarios, including phantom and synthetic mouse models.
The DL framework demonstrated exceptional performance in both tasks.
The 1D CNN achieved a high coefficient-of-determination (R² > 0.9885) and a low mean-absolute-error (MAE < 0.6248) in XRF signal extraction.
The U-Net model achieved an average structural-similarity-index-measure (SSIM) of 0.9791 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 39.11 in XFCT image reconstruction, closely matching ground truth images.
Notably, the DL approach (vs. the conventional approach) reduced the total post-processing time per slice from approximately 6 min to just 1.25 s.
