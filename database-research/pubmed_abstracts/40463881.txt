The FLAME trial reported that focal boosting of prostate tumors up to 95 Gy in 35 fractions improves biochemical control (disease-free survival).
However, this treatment (regimen) is not commonly used in the United States.
We investigated a focally boosted treatment of 84 Gy in 28 fractions (EQD2-108 Gy, BED 252 Gy).
