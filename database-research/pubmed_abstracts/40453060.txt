Real-world outcome data for patients with large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) who are uninsured or have socioeconomic barriers to care are limited.
We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed LBCL treated in a large safety-net hospital system.
Between January 2011 and June 2022, 496 patients aged >18 years were diagnosed with LBCL at Harris Health System, Houston, Texas.
The median age was 53 years, 75% were uninsured, and 81% were in the most disadvantaged Area Deprivation Index national quartiles.
Most (69%) had stage III/IV disease, 44% had poor-risk disease by the Revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI), and 17% had a history of HIV infection.
The median diagnosis-to-treatment interval was 17 days.
The median follow-up time was 53.5 months.
Among 464 evaluable patients, 66% achieved a complete response, and 11% had a partial response.
Of 48 patients, 26 (54%) eligible for cell therapies received them.
At 5 years, event-free and overall survival (OS) rates were 57% and 68%, respectively.
Factors that affected OS included Hispanic ethnicity (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70;
