Inherited familial tumors are linked to distinct germline mutations that result in different syndromic phenotypes, increasing cancer risk in patients.
Recent findings have unveiled new evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations and highlighted the essential role of biomolecular and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses in pinpointing predictive markers for immune-therapy responses.
Lynch Syndrome (LS), recently identified as four unique hereditary cancer syndromes, is defined by specific germline mutations in Mismatch Repair Genes
