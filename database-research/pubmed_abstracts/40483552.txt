Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), characterized by severe facial pain triggered by mild stimuli, is challenging to treat effectively and non-invasively.
Traditional treatments, including microvascular decompression and medications like carbamazepine, have limitations.
This study investigates the potential of Bulleyaconitine A (BAA), an alkaloid that selectively inhibits specific sodium channels, for managing TN in a rat model via intranasal administration.
