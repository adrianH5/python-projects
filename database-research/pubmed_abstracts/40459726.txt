Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma that is primarily driven by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and ultraviolet radiation.
Due to its rarity and innocuous appearance on clinical exam, MCC diagnosis is often delayed and therefore diagnosed at advanced stages.
Overall survival outcomes are poor and notably worse than melanoma, with an estimated five-year survival ranging from 35 to 60% for stage I or II disease to <â€‰15% for metastatic disease.
Our review examines the diagnostic workup, prognostic markers, and current and emerging treatments of MCC.
