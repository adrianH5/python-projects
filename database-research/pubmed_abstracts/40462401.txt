Perivascular epithelioid cell tumours (PEComas) show variable smooth muscle and melanocytic differentiation and mostly harbour mTOR pathway activation via TSC2 inactivation.
Five-10% of sporadic PEComas instead harbour fusions involving TFE3, anÂ vmTOR pathway target.
Malignancy in TSC2/1-inactivated PEComa correlates with TP53, RB1 or ATRX inactivation.
Here, we investigated genetic correlates of malignancy in TFE3-rearranged PEComa.
