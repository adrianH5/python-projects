This paper addresses the persistent underrepresentation of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in health research, particularly in the context of prostate cancer.
Despite the disproportionately higher burden of cancer in Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, their representation in research remains inadequate.
This paper highlights the efforts of The Patient and Public Involvement Cancer Research Group for Diverse Backgrounds (Diverse PPI), a PPI group established to address this disparity.
We describe the rationale behind Diverse PPI's formation, emphasising the need for targeted outreach and culturally competent practices.
The group's activities include organising public engagement events, developing resources such as ARUARES (a tool designed to foster inclusive research) and collaborating with researchers on various projects.
The paper illustrates how Diverse PPI has made a positive impact through collaborative working, empowering diverse ethnic communities and advocating for inclusive research practices.
We conclude by emphasising the importance of similar initiatives in addressing health disparities and achieving equitable representation in cancer research.
