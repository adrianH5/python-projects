We read with great interest the systematic review by Ghazali et al., which rigorously synthesizes data from 32 longitudinal studies involving 12,206 patients to explore the prognostic significance of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom-specific outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing radiotherapy (RT).
The authors employed best-evidence synthesis methodology and highlighted post-treatment physical function as a robust predictor of overall survival (OS).
Moreover, the study underscores the prognostic impact of several clinical variables, such as dysphagia, social eating challenges, and loss of appetite, all of which merit further attention in designing personalized treatment approaches for HNC survivors.
While the review makes a timely and essential contribution to the literature, we respectfully suggest several areas where further clarification and expanded analysis may strengthen the interpretation and future applicability of the findings.
