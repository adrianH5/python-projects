Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by follicular dysplasia, with granulosa cells (GCs) glycolysis playing a pivotal role in this pathology.
Although the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in diverse biological processes of PCOS has been well documented, the molecular mechanism of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) in PCOS remains unclear.
