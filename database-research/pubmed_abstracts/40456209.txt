Chordomas are rare neoplasms derived from the notochord, primarily affecting the skull base and sacral regions.
While cranial nerve deficits are common, CSF rhinorrhea as an initial symptom is rare.
Ecchordosis physaliphora (EP), another notochord-derived lesion, is typically asymptomatic but may also be present with CSF leakage.
Differentiating between these entities remains challenging due to overlapping histopathological and imaging features.
