The diagnosis of sex cord-stromal tumors is challenging.
They show a wide spectrum of behaviours and associations with clinically important pathogenic germ line variants.
In view of recent advances in molecular subtyping and risk factors we wished to investigate the differences in diagnosis for a range of these tumours using expert genito-urinary (GU) pathologists with an interest in this area.
Forty-four tumors were selected and 18 pathologists (members of TEsticular Sex-cord Stromal Tumor group [TESST]) were invited to view the cases online and give a diagnosis.
Consensus was taken as 70% agreement.
Consensus was achieved in 59% (26/44) cases.
However, there were many areas of disagreement which included variability in the diagnosis of Sertoli cell tumour and Leydig cell tumour particularly in malignant lesions and difficulty in assignation of fibro-thecomas or myoid gonadal stromal tumours, as well as variability in the diagnosis of granulosa cell tumours, and in the diagnosis of rarer paediatric tumours.
Pathologists placed different weight on positivity with some markers, particularly beta-catenin, S100 and SMA.
Some pathologists diagnosed novel diagnostic entities such as inflammatory and nested testicular sex cord tumor not currently in the WHO classification.
Recommendations to assist in the construction of a new classification to achieve more concordance and better treatment of these rare tumours are included.
