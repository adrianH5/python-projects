The MELACARE intervention aimed to evaluate a nurse-led follow-up program incorporating skin self-examination (SSE) education and psychosocial support to address fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in early-stage melanoma survivors.
This study assessed the MELACARE intervention's impact on FCR, psychological well-being, SSE performance, and healthcare usage compared to standard physician-led follow-up.
