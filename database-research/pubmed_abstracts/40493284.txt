Recent studies have indicated a close relationship between SENP3 and osteoporosis.
However, the detailed molecular mechanism of SENP3 mediating osteoporosis has not been well studied.
The goal of this work was to study the specific mechanism by which SENP3 regulates downstream genes through deSUMOylation and thus affects the progression of osteoporosis.
