Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic target in oncology due to its unique mechanism involving lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species accumulation.
In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ferroptosis offers promising strategies to overcome drug resistance and enhance the efficacy of existing therapies.
While the literature on ferroptosis in NSCLC has expanded rapidly over the past decade, a comprehensive understanding of its research trends, global collaboration patterns, and emerging hotspots remains lacking.
