Specific induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-initiated type-II immunogenic cell death (ICD) shows great potential in boosting tumor immunogenicity and anti-tumor immunotherapy.
However, it remains challenging to selectively provoke type-II ICD, due to the lack of highly efficient ER targeting strategy.
Here, a pH/Cathepsin-Activatable Nanoplatform (PCAN) is reported to specifically photo-induce ER stress (PCAN
