Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) frequently metastasize to the liver, with heterogeneity in tumor grade impacting patient prognosis and treatment.
The Ki-67 index, a key prognostic marker, often varies between primary and metastatic sites; however, routine liver biopsy remains controversial.
Although percutaneous computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy (PCT-CNB) is safe and effective for focal lesions, its role in detecting intertumor grading discrepancies and survival implications in GEP-NETs is underexplored.
Conflicting survival associations with grade shifts have been reported in previous studies.
We hypothesized that PCT-CNB could identify clinically significant grading heterogeneity in liver metastases, correlating with survival outcomes, thereby refining risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.
