Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most widely used antineoplastic drugs for the treatment of solid cancers.
Its mechanism of action involves binding to Î²-tubulin subunits, leading to the stabilization of microtubule polymers and subsequent cell cycle arrest.
Despite its efficacy, PTX is associated with significant adverse effects, most notably peripheral neurotoxicity and neuropathic pain, which represent the primary dose-limiting side effects.
In sensory neurons, PTX affects multiple molecular pathways, with early alterations in excitability and calcium signaling following acute drug exposure.
To investigate these mechanisms, we employed a combination of calcium imaging, electrophysiological techniques, and pharmacological approaches to explore the role of ORAI channels in the excitability and calcium dynamics of mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons.
Our findings reveal that acute exposure to low doses of PTX triggers IP
