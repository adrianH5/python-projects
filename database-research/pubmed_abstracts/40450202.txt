Marginalised communities (including minoritised ethnic groups and people with lower socioeconomic status) often present with a late cancer stage at diagnosis, affecting survival.
This is due to many factors including cultural barriers, mistrust of health services and low levels of cancer awareness.
Communities Against Cancer (CAC) aimed to promote cancer awareness and healthy lifestyles and help-seeking behaviours for marginalised communities through a grant-scheme that provided funding for community-led projects, which ran from 1st January 2021 - 31st December 2022.
This paper reports findings from a study that assessed whether CAC met its aims and the characteristics of successfully delivered projects.
