The number of reports of robotic surgery for rectal cancer with combined resection of other organs is increasing gradually, with most procedures performed using the da Vinci Surgical System.
The hinotori Surgical Robot System, developed in Japan, was approved for gastrointestinal surgery and gynecology in 2022.
Here, we report the first case of en-bloc rectal resection with hysterectomy using the hinotori Surgical Robot System.
A 77-year-old woman was referred to our institution with a diagnosis of rectal cancer (cT4bN1bM1a), with uterine invasion and a resectable liver metastasis.
We performed rectal resection with total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy using the hinotori Surgical Robot System.
Two surgical teams, a gastroenterological team and a gynecological team, performed en-bloc resection of the rectum and uterus.
Because of in-depth consultation between the teams, the operation was performed safely with no unplanned additional ports, robotic arm interference or arm collision with the assistant surgeon.
Including the preceding stoma closure, the operative time was 473 minutes, and blood loss was 60 mL.
The patient experienced no complications â‰¥ Clavien-Dindo classification grade III.
Robot-assisted extended surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer using the hinotori Surgical Robot System can be performed safely, which may lead to an expanded treatment option in the future.
