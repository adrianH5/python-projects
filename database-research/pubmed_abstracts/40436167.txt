Skin ulcer disease is a significant health and economic challenge in the growing turtle farming industry, primarily caused by pathogenic microorganisms found in aquatic environments.
This study aimed to identify bacterial pathogens responsible for skin ulcer disease in farmed turtles and evaluate potential treatments.
Bacterial strains were isolated from lesion tissues of diseased turtles, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed distinct microbial compositions between healthy and diseased turtles.
Aeromonas hydrophilia was identified as the primary pathogen through enrichment evaluation, in vitro culturation and in vivo infection models.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed high resistance rates of A. hydrophilia to a wide variety of antibiotics among the isolated bacteria, highlighting the necessity for alternative treatments.
The therapeutic potential of Longan leaf polysaccharides (LLP) against A. hydrophilia were subsequently evaluated.
In vitro experiments showed that LLP significantly inhibited the growth of A. hydrophilia.
In addition, LLP treatment effectively reduced bacterial loads and alleviated disease symptoms in infected turtles in vivo.
Transcriptomic analysis further revealed potential genes associated with antibacterial activity of LLP against A. hydrophilia.
This study establishes A. hydrophilia as the leading cause of skin ulcer disease in farmed turtles and introduces LLP as a promising, natural therapeutic option to mitigate the disease.
