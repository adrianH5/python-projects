Patients with gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) may present skeletal fragility that might be related to multiple factors, including bone metastases, vitamin D deficiency, hormone secretion, and disease treatments.
This study examines the prevalence and determinants of fragility fractures in low grading (G1-G2) GEP-NETs.
This retrospective study included 291 patients with G1-G2 GEP-NETs (154 men and 137 women).
A longitudinal examination was available for 247 patients, with a median follow-up of 49 months (range 24-83).
Information regarding disease course, osteo-metabolic profile, and clinical fractures were collected from electronic medical records.
Opportunistic chest-abdomen computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans were retrospectively examined to investigate morphometric vertebral fractures.
Fracture prevalence in men over 50 and post-menopausal women (n = 200) was compared to an age-matched control sample of 1010 subjects (146 men and 864 women).
Forty-five patients with GEP-NETs (15.5%) had fragility fractures at diagnosis of disease.
Fractures were significantly associated with age, body mass index, comorbidities, and severe vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)vitamin D < 10 ng/mL) at univariate analysis, and to severe vitamin D deficiency (p = .03) and age (p = .01) at multivariate analysis.
When compared to the control group, GEP-NETs patients were found to be independently associated with fractures (OR 2.0 IC95% [1.1-3.6], p = .02).
At longitudinal evaluation, 10% of GEP-NETs experienced new fractures in relation to pre-existing fractures and surgical treatment of the tumor.
This study provides first evidence that GEP-NETs may have a high risk of fragility fractures at the diagnosis of the disease.
A proper and early assessment of bone health is therefore advisable in these patients.
