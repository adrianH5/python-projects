The standard treatment for newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients typically involves triplet therapy (TT) with bortezomib, lenalidomide or thalidomide, and dexamethasone, followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation.
Adding daratumumab, a CD38-targeting monoclonal antibody, to TT has shown promise, though available evidence remains limited.
This study systematically reviews and analyzes the impact of adding daratumumab to TT in these patients.
