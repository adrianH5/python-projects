PSA response is a key prognostic tool in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).
Data from SWOG 9346 and TITAN post-hoc analyses demonstrated the prognostic value of PSA thresholds at 6-7 months after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or ADT plus apalutamide.
However, variability in thresholds and timing highlights the need to explore PSA kinetics in real-world cohorts.
This study investigates PSA dynamics and their predictors following Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors (ARSI) initiation.
