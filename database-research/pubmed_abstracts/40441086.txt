Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of gynecologic cancer mortality and has recently been linked to microbial dysbiosis or oncobiosis.
Tumorigenesis is a highly complex process, and recent research has revealed numerous new mechanisms showing how tumors interact with their surrounding microenvironment.
The inclusion of microbiome studies has significantly advanced this field revealing the important role microbes play, not only in maintaining normal physiological functions of the human body but also in influencing oncogenic pathways.
This expanding knowledge is deepening our understanding of tumor pathophysiology and is helping to create new diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic and preventive strategies for specific cancers.
This review explores the role of the microbiome in ovarian carcinogenesis, focusing on its interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its influence on inflammation, immune regulation and metabolic signaling.
This review studied dysbiosis in several anatomical compartments such as the gut, oral cavity, lower and upper genital tracts and ovarian tissues, in relation to ovarian oncobiosis.
Emerging clinical implications of these studies include the use of microbial profiles as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.
Therapeutic strategies such as fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics are also discussed for their ability to restore microbial balance and enhance treatment efficacy.
This review highlights the importance of continued research to explore causal relationships between the microbiome and tumorigenesis, positioning microbiome studies as promising tools in ovarian cancer management and improving patient care.
