A 39-year-old woman undergoing breast cancer treatment presented with a loss of appetite and fatigue.
Computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse heterogeneity in the left hepatic lobe and thickened bile duct walls with contrast enhancement.
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a high signal intensity throughout the left hepatic lobe, extending to the common bile duct.
The case findings highlight the extreme rarity of diffuse hepatic metastases with common bile duct infiltration in breast cancer and underscore the critical roles of CT and MRI in identifying distinctive imaging findings that are pivotal for making a diagnosis and selecting timely management.
