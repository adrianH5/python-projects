The therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has significantly increased since the first mAb was introduced.
Despite their therapeutic benefits, mAbs have been accompanied by a rise in adverse effects, affecting various organ systems including the skin.
This systematic review consolidates the current literature on the incidence, characteristics, and management of adverse dermatological events (ADEs) post-mAb treatment, focusing on Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), erythema multiforme (EM), and fixed drug eruption (FDE).
