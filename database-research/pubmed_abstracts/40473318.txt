Prostate cancer metastasises via haematogenous or lymphatic routes and may be found at atypical sites.
This is the first reported case of metastatic prostate cancer in the lymph nodes of the inferior mesenteric artery distribution following anterior resection for colon cancer in the South-East Asian population.
Immunohistochemical staining was crucial to determine that the early staged colonic carcinoma was adequately resected and thus directs the focus of subsequent oncological treatment on the residual metastatic prostate carcinoma.
This highlights the importance of communication between the multidisciplinary team (surgeon, histopathologist and oncologist) to arrive at the correct diagnoses and thereby, appropriate management for patients with synchronous malignancies.
