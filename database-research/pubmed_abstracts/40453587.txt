Positron-emission-tomography-(PET)/computed-tomography-(CT) using somatostatin-receptor-(SSTR)-binding radioligands is well established in the imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
SSTRs are expressed in NETs and endocrine and exocrine tissues, e.g.
pancreas, where somatostatin binding to SST2 and SST5 inhibits glucagon and insulin secretion.
Pancreatic background activity on SSTR-PET varies widely and is increased in up to 45% of cases.
High uptake in the
