Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.
Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, has shown promise in targeting key cancer pathways, but its precise molecular mechanisms in CRC are not fully understood.
This study investigates the anti-cancer mechanisms of curcumin on CRC progression, focusing on PTBP1 and CDK2 as critical regulators.
