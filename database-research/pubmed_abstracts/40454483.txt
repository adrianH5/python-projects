Lineage plasticity is recognized as a critical determinant of lethality and resistance to AR pathway inhibitors in prostate cancer.
Lineage plasticity is a continuum, ranging from AR activity-low tumors, AR-null tumors that do not express a neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) program (i.e., double-negative prostate cancer [DNPC]), and AR-null NEPC tumors.
Factors upregulated early in lineage plasticity are not well-characterized.
The clarification of such factors is essential to identify tumors undergoing lineage plasticity or at risk of this occurring.
Our integrative analysis of metastatic prostate cancer patient tumors, patient-derived xenografts, and cell models determined that PROX1 is upregulated early in the lineage plasticity continuum and progressively increases as tumors lose AR activity.
We determined DNA methylation is a key regulator of PROX1 expression.
PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC reduces cell survival and impacts apoptosis and differentiation, demonstrating PROX1's functional importance.
PROX1 is not directly targetable with standard drug development approaches.
However, affinity immunopurification demonstrated histone deacetylases (HDACs) are among the top PROX1-interacting proteins; HDAC inhibition depletes PROX1 and recapitulates PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC.
Altogether, our results suggest PROX1 promotes the emergence of lineage plasticity, and HDAC inhibition is a promising approach to treat tumors across the lineage plasticity continuum.
