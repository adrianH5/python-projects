We have previously shown that valproic acid (VPA) alters the expression of placental carriers of essential nutrients, including folates.
Here, we exposed a placental cell line to VPA, its central nervous system-active amide derivative sec-butylpropylacetamide (SPD), and its individual stereoisomers to address the question of whether folate carrier expression can predict the teratogenicity of VPA-related compounds.
We additionally conducted a pilot analysis of folate transfer across placental cell monolayers to estimate the translation of altered carrier expression to carrier activity.
