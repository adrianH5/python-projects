Cancer continues to be the foremost cause of mortality in humans.
Persistent challenges in cancer treatment include inadequate drug targeting, severe toxicological side effects and uncontrolled drug distribution.
The bioinspired membrane vesicle drug delivery systems have been emerging as promising therapeutic strategies.
This study characterises unique cell-bound membrane vesicles (CBMVs), which are impervious to standard cleaning agents and effectively loaded with doxorubicin (DOX).
For the first time, we used iRGD peptide to modify the CBMVs to enhance the CBMVs' targeting capabilities for cancer cells.
