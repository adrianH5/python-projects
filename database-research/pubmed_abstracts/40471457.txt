Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) frequently leads to postoperative gastrointestinal complications, delaying recovery.
This study assessed the effectiveness of combining the LEARNS nursing model with auricular acupressure and intestinal rehabilitation techniques to enhance postoperative recovery in RARP patients.
A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 256 male patients undergoing RARP.
Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 128), receiving the LEARNS model combined with auricular acupressure and intestinal rehabilitation nursing, or a control group (n = 128), receiving conventional postoperative care.
Primary outcomes included the time to first postoperative exhaust, bowel sound recovery, first defecation, severity of abdominal distension, and duration of hospital stay.
Compared to the control group, the intervention group demonstrated significantly shorter bowel sound recovery time (4.45 ± 0.87 vs. 5.21 ± 1.02 h, P < 0.001), earlier first exhaust (24.35 ± 2.75 vs. 30.25 ± 2.15 h, P < 0.001), and earlier first defecation (75.35 ± 4.23 vs. 83.52 ± 6.53 h, P < 0.001).
The intervention group also experienced significantly reduced severity of abdominal distension and shorter postoperative hospital stays (5.28 ± 1.22 vs. 6.56 ± 1.08 days, P < 0.001).
Integrating the LEARNS nursing model with auricular acupressure and intestinal rehabilitation substantially accelerates gastrointestinal recovery following RARP.
Embedding this evidence-based, multimodal nursing protocol into routine perioperative care pathways may reduce postoperative morbidity, shorten hospital stay, and optimise healthcare resource utilisation, thereby providing considerable clinical value.
