Nanomedicines are nanoscale, biocompatible materials that offer promising alternatives to conventional treatment options for brain disorders.
The recent technological developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), are transforming the nanomedicine field by improving disease diagnosis, biomarker identification, prognostic assessment and disease monitoring, targeted drug delivery, and therapeutic intervention as well as contributing to computational and methodological developments.
These advancements can be achieved by analysis of large clinical datasets and facilitating the design and optimization of nanomaterials for
