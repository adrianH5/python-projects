Currently, molecules with the potential to act as biomarkers in the prevention and early diagnosis of diseases are being sought.
The above implies that these molecules play key roles in specific stages of the disease or are associated with them.
However, before proposing these types of molecules as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, it is essential to thoroughly understand their action mechanism.
In this work, the most relevant findings on the function, regulation, disease´s association studies of the ALPK1 protein with kinase activity (α kinase-1) are highlighted.
Unlike other protein kinases, ALPK1 specifically recognizes the conformation part of the alpha helix as the phosphorylation site.
The objective of this review is to analyze the functions of ALPK1 in different pathologies and to determine whether this protein plays an important role in these diseases, and if it could be used as a biomarker for the progression or prediction of an inflammatory disease.
