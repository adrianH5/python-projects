Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which can progress to liver cancer and even death, remains a public health problem.
The high variability of HBV leading to the accumulation of mutations influences the natural history of this infection.
Mutations in the precore/core region, in particular the G1896A mutation, have been associated with severe forms of liver disease in certain populations around the world.
The aim of this study was to determine the molecular epidemiology of the HBV precore G1896A mutation and its relationship to hepatic complications in HBV chronically infected patients.
