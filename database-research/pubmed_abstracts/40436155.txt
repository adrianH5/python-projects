Conventional drug delivery systems for cancer therapy have faced various challenges, including side effects and inadequate drug release behavior, which require addressing.
Recently, targeted nanocarriers have attracted considerable attention to overcome these challenges.
Stimuli-responsive chitosan combined with lipid-based carriers (CLBCs) provides an innovative targeted system that can release its encapsulated drug in response to stimuli, such as pH and temperature, in the tumor site.
In addition, these hybrid systems possess unique properties of high biodegradability, controlled release, mucoadhesion, and co-delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.
This review summarizes the recent advances in stimuli-responsive CLBCs, including their unique properties, useful structures, and applications in cancer therapy.
Moreover, the perspective and challenges of stimuli-responsive CLBCs are also discussed.
