In combination with chemotherapy, bevacizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against angiogenesis, significantly increases progression-free survival (PFS) in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
However, due to financial constraints, real-world experience with bevacizumab in EOC is lacking in Indian populations.
This study assessed bevacizumab's efficacy with chemotherapy in platinum-sensitive and resistant EOC in resource-limited Indian populations.
