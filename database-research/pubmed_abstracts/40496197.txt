The celiac axis (CA) is usually dependent on blood supply from the superior mesenteric artery via the pancreatic arcade, particularly in cases of CA stenosis.
During pancreaticoduodenectomy, excision of the gastroduodenal artery poses a significant risk of organ ischemia in the CA territory and may compromise anastomotic integrity.
In cases of median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), blood flow typically improves after ligament transection.
However, if atherosclerosis is present and chronic arterial compression is induced by the median arcuate ligament, stenting or revascularization may be required.
Although revascularization is the most definitive technique, it raises concerns about anastomotic disruption due to postoperative pancreatic leakage.
Considering these complexities, a thorough preoperative assessment of blood flow and the development of strategies to ensure adequate perfusion after resection are critical.
Here, we encountered a patient with pancreatic cancer and MALS complicated by atherosclerosis.
