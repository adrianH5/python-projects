Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a common risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, potentially more atherogenic per particle than low-density lipoprotein.
An estimated 1.5 billion individuals globally have elevated levels â‰¥125 nmol/L, considered as a risk-enhancing threshold.
Although Lp(a) levels vary by ethnicity, ongoing trials of novel therapies in predominantly secondary prevention patients use fixed Lp(a) enrollment thresholds.
