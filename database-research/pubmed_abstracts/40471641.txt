Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and new therapeutic approaches are needed.
This study investigates the efficacy of a new zinc oxide-based nanomedicine in a mouse model of heterotopic lung cancer.
C57BL/6 mouse model with Lewis lung carcinoma (LL2) cells was used.
The mice were treated with different doses of nanodrug, cisplatin, or phosphate-buffered saline.
Tumor growth, metastasis, markers for oxidative stress, and immune responses, in particular the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, were examined.
The nanodrug significantly reduced tumor size, inhibited metastasis, and improved survival compared to the control group.
Moreover, no significant toxic effect was observed in hematological, biochemical and histopathological analyses.
Furthermore, the nanodrug altered the tumor microenvironment in favor of immune system activation by modulating the level of oxidative stress and increasing CD8+ cell infiltration.
The results show that this new nanomedicine may be a candidate for an effective treatment for lung cancer.
