Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents a high-risk subtype of B-ALL.
The disease is driven by a range of kinase-activating mutations, resulting in a similar gene expression profile to that of Ph-positive ALL, and one which may be targetable by JAK- or ABL-directed kinase inhibition.
