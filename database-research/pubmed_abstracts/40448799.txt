Cancer comprises a group of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth, forming malignant tumors that can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.
Owing to continuous exposure to environmental carcinogens, the oral cavity is a common site for malignant epithelial neoplasms in the head and neck region, with tongue cancer being particularly prevalent.
Tongue cancer tends to exhibit aggressive behaviour, often resulting in recurrence and lymph and distant metastasis.
CD9, a member of the tetraspanin family, plays a crucial role because of its membrane-dependent effects.
Its biological activities include cell adhesion, motility, metastasis, growth, signal transduction and differentiation.
