Patients with gynecologic malignancies often require a multimodality imaging approach for initial staging, treatment response assessment, and surveillance.
MRI imaging and PET are two well-established and widely accepted modalities in this setting.
Although PET and MRI imaging are often acquired separately on two platforms (a PET/computed tomography [CT] and an MRI imaging scanner), hybrid PET/MRI scanners offer the potential for comprehensive disease assessment in one visit.
Gynecologic malignancies have been one of the most successful areas for implementation of PET/MRI.
This article provides an overview of the role of this platform in the care of patients with gynecologic malignancies.
