Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are the second most common primary pancreatic neoplasms.
Tumors in their classical state are characterized by monotonous plasmacytoid epithelial cells featuring moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically placed round to oval nuclei with stippled "salt-and-pepper" chromatin.
Tumors may exhibit diverse architectural patterns such as nests, pseudorosettes, and trabeculae.
Nontraditional morphologic patterns have been described, but their prognostic and clinical relevance and molecular correlations have not been explored.
