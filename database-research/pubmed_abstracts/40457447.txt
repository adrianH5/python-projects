Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are crucial molecules that do not encode proteins but play roles in regulating various biological processes.
Recent research highlights that ncRNAs not only control gene expression within cells but also facilitate intercellular communication via exosomes and other carriers.
This function is vital in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Our review covers the structure and functions of different ncRNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs).
We examine how these ncRNAs influence tumor initiation and progression.
Additionally, we explore their role in promoting tumor growth or immune evasion by modulating the TME.
The potential of using these ncRNAs as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for clinical use is also discussed.
As our understanding of ncRNAs grows, the development of new therapies based on ncRNAs is anticipated to offer improved treatment options for cancer patients.
