Detection of tumor-associated natural killer cells (TANKs) is crucial for evaluating cancer immunotherapy because they are found to be associated with improved overall survival rate.
However, existing analytical methods relying on tissue biopsy are invasive and static, restricting their capacity to deliver dynamic information.
Herein, we report an activatable near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) macromolecular reporter (BhCyNK) for real-time imaging of TANKs.
To optimize the PA performance, the fluorophore scaffold of BhCyNK is screened.
Among four hemicyanine derivatives, BhCy
