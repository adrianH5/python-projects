Accumulating evidence demonstrates that miRNAs exhibit enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and specificity compared to the conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), particularly showing promising clinical utility in early-stage HCC detection.
However, insufficient transparency in methodology reporting compromises the validity assessment of these findings and hinders their translational applications.
In this study, we investigated the adherence to the STARD criteria in studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of miRNA for liver cancer.
In addition, the quality of reporting was examined to identify factors influencing the quality of reporting.
