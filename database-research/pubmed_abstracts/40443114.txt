Colloidal nanozymes, enzyme-mimetic nanocatalysts with tunable catalytic activity, are revolutionizing cancer diagnosis and therapy by integrating catalytic precision with biomedical functionality.
Their ability to regulate redox homeostasis, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulate tumor microenvironments provides a foundation for targeted therapeutic interventions, while their intrinsic catalytic properties enhance biosensing and imaging for early cancer detection.
However, the rational design of nanozymes remains a challenge, particularly in optimizing their catalytic efficiency, biocompatibility, and specificity for tumor-selective reactions.
This review explores how surface chemistry, interfacial engineering, and catalytic mechanisms dictate nanozyme activity, stability, and interactions with biological systems.
We critically analyze the fundamental catalytic mechanisms peroxidase-like, oxidase-like, catalase-like, and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like reactions driving nanozyme applications in cancer therapy, as well as their role in biosensors, imaging probes, and theranostic platforms for early cancer diagnosis.
Additionally, we examine cutting-edge surface modification strategies, including atomic dispersion, ligand coordination, and defect engineering, to enhance nanozyme selectivity and reduce off-target effects.
By integrating fundamental catalysis with translational biomedical applications, this review establishes a comprehensive framework for advancing nanozyme-based diagnostics and therapeutics in precision oncology.
