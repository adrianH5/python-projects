Oral cancer affects the mucosal epithelium located within the oral cavity.
The prevalence of oral cancer is projected to increase by ~40% by 2040, leading to a subsequent rise in mortality rates.
Oral carcinogenesis is complex and multifactorial and numerous signaling pathways are involved in disease development.
Deubiquitination is commonly involved in the post-translational process of proteins, and serves a key role in tumorigenesis and cancer development.
The present review aims to discuss the function of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in oral cancer, with a particular focus on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
The present review also aims to investigate the functional mechanisms, tumorigenic regulation and therapeutic targets of DUBs in OSCC, which may potentially provide a novel theoretical basis for the utilization of DUBs as molecular targets in the treatment of OSCC in the future.
