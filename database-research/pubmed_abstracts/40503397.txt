The high mortality rate and recurrence/metastasis remain major challenges in the clinical management of gastric cancer (GC) patients.
To optimize treatment stratification and management, there is an urgent need for efficient and non-invasive biomarkers.
A meta-analysis on the prognostic role of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in GC revealed a strong association between CTCs and patient prognosis.
Among CTC subtypes, Interstitial CTCs (I-CTCs) exhibited the strongest invasiveness.
This study innovatively investigated the expression profile of I-CTCs in advanced GC patients to evaluate their clinical utility.
