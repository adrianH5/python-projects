Radon gas, a significant source of indoor radiation exposure, poses serious health risks, particularly lung cancer.
This study employs Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) using the ANSYS Fluent software to model the behaviour and distribution of radon gas in a laboratory space equipped with granite countertops.
A three-dimensional model of the laboratory, including its geometry, ventilation rates, and radon exhalation sources, was developed to simulate radon concentrations, particularly at breathing height.
Radon exhalation rate from the granite and other surfaces in the room was measured experimentally.
Numerical results, validated by experimental measurements, revealed a 30% increase in average radon concentration following the installation of granite countertops with an exhalation rate of 6.5 Bq m
