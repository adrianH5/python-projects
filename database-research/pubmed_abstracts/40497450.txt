Microplastics represent a group of emerging environmental contaminants widely recognized for their potential impacts on human health, particularly concerning the pathogenesis of cancer.
Generally defined as plastic particles between 1 Î¼m and 5 mm, microplastics and nanoparticles are major environmental contaminants and potential health hazards.
This review aims to engage with the intricate dimensions of microplastics, and their classification and persistence across different ecosystems.
It underscores their bioaccumulation and pervasive presence.
Although significant insights have been garnered, much remains to be elucidated regarding the full spectrum of impact microplastics have on human health.
Evidence derived from both epidemiological and experimental studies underscores the urgent necessity for clinical research to elucidate the microplastic-cancer connection.
It is a very important concern in biomedicine as cancer remains the leading cause of mortality irrespective of the advancement in diagnostic and therapeutic regimens.
Furthermore, improvements in the detection and analysis of microplastics within biological samples are also scrutinized.
The article concludes with future directions which advocate for standardized research protocols, regulatory measures and interdisciplinary collaboration to confront the microscopic threat posed by microplastics in cancer pathogenesis.
However, this endeavour necessitates concerted efforts across various scientific domains, because only through such collaboration can we hope to achieve meaningful progress in understanding this critical issue.
