Precision medicine has revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling highly personalized therapeutic strategies based on an individual's genetic, molecular, and environmental characteristics.
Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), molecular profiling, and biomarker-driven approaches have enhanced diagnostic accuracy and optimized treatment selection.
Targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and liquid biopsy techniques have significantly improved patient outcomes while minimizing adverse effects compared to conventional treatments.
Despite these advancements, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance, high costs, and limited accessibility continue to hinder widespread clinical adoption.
While tumour heterogeneity presents a major obstacle in cancer treatment, the challenge is further compounded by the complexity of the tumour microenvironment, where dynamic interactions between cancer cells and surrounding stromal components drive disease progression.
Additionally, ethical concerns regarding genetic data privacy and disparities in access to precision oncology require further attention.
This review highlights the transformative impact of precision medicine in oncology, emphasizing its benefits, limitations, and the need for continued research.
Future advancements in artificial intelligence, multi-omics integration, and adaptive clinical trial designs will be critical in overcoming current challenges and expanding precision medicine's applicability across diverse cancer types.
With ongoing innovations, precision oncology has the potential to redefine cancer care, making tailored treatments more accessible, effective, and widely implementable.
