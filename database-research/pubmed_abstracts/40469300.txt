Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has a poor prognosis and requires novel therapeutic approaches.
Previously, we discovered that a high dose of human peripheral blood-derived natural killer (PB-NK) cells can have antitumor effects against CRPC.
However, whether antibodies against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) can direct adoptive NK cells to the tumor site and therefore decrease NK cell dosage through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity remains unknown.
