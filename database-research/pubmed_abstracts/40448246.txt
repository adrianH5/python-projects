Cervical cancer screening programs are increasingly relying on sensitive molecular approaches as primary tests to detect high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPV), the causative agents of cervix cancer.
Although hrHPV infection is a pre-requisite for the development of most precancerous lesions, the mere detection of viral nucleic acids, also present in transient infections, is not specific of the underlying cellular state, resulting in poor positive predictive values (PPV) regarding lesional states.
There is a need to increase the specificity of molecular tests for better stratifying individuals at risk of cancer and to adapt follow-up strategies.
