Due to limited regulation of private wells, individuals who rely on wells as a potable water supply frequently face significant challenges in ensuring safe drinking water.
Widespread occurrences of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater increase these challenges and pose additional threats to public health.
Addressing these challenges requires an understanding of the geophysical factors influencing PFAS contamination and the socioeconomic conditions that shape access to resources for testing and mitigation.
This study evaluates both within a more densely sampled region than previous studies to increase our understanding of PFAS contamination.
Over a three-year period (2021-2023), a community-science campaign sampled 167 private wells across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States (120,000Â km
