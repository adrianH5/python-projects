Intermittent fasting (IF) is increasingly recognized as an effective dietary intervention for slowing aging process and alleviating metabolic disturbances in multiple chronic diseases, especially in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
Despite recent progress, the mechanisms behind its effects on cardiovascular health from the perspective of circadian rhythms are not yet fully understood.
This review aims to explore the interaction between IF and circadian rhythms, focusing on their combined effects on cardiometabolic risks and cardiovascular outcomes.
Evidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that IF provides protective effects against cardiac damage and dysfunction.
It is also indicated that IF influences key cardiometabolic risk factors, such as insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, by aligning with the intrinsic biological rhythms.
Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of IF in cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in individuals with circadian disruptions.
This review also highlights future research directions to identify the most effective fasting protocols and assess the long-term cardiovascular benefits of IF in disease prevention and treatment.
