Ototoxicity, or hearing loss and damage to the auditory system caused by certain medications, is a significant clinical challenge.
Many commonly used drugs, including antimicrobials, cancer therapies, and loop diuretics, have the potential to induce temporary or permanent ototoxicity.
The underlying mechanisms are complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors.
Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genetic makeup influences their response to drugs, has emerged as a promising field for understanding and mitigating ototoxicity.
Developing personalized approaches to prevent and manage ototoxicity is crucial, and this is where the pharmacogenomic basis of ototoxicity becomes crucial.
This review aims to provide healthcare professionals with an updated perspective on the genetics of ototoxicity by summarizing the latest research and insights in this rapidly evolving field.
It presents a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and genetic factors associated with drug-induced ototoxicity, with a particular focus on cisplatin and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
