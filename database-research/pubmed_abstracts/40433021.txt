Oncology nursing is a dynamic and evolving field that requires high-quality, research-informed care to meet the complex needs of cancer patients.
The integration of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is crucial for improving clinical outcomes, enhancing symptom management, and promoting patient-centered care.
Nurse leaders play a pivotal role in advancing EBP adoption by demonstrating transformational leadership, providing mentorship, and advocating for supportive organizational structures.
Professional nursing also demands active engagement in research, both as contributors to the evidence base and as informed consumers of research findings.
Despite this, barriers such as resistance to change, limited time, and insufficient institutional support often hinder the effective implementation of EBPs.
Overcoming these challenges through increased research funding, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the use of innovative technologies is key to cultivating a culture of evidence-based oncology nursing.
Strong nurse leadership remains essential in bridging the gap between research and clinical practice, ultimately ensuring the delivery of high-quality oncology care.
