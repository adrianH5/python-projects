Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an exceptionally aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis.
TNBC patients have limited treatment options beyond conventional chemotherapy, and they face significant challenges associated with disease recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy.
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, growth, metabolism, and survival.
Its aberrant activation is closely linked to the development and progression of TNBC, as well as treatment response and drug resistance.
Currently, numerous targeted drugs specifically inhibiting this signaling pathway are being developed and undergoing clinical trials.
These include inhibitors targeting PI3K, AKT, or mTOR individually, as well as dual-target or multi-target inhibitors simultaneously targeting different components of this pathway.
Encouragingly, some inhibitors have demonstrated promising potential in clinical trials.
This review delves into the therapeutic potential of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway for TNBC and explores prospects for drug discovery.
