Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL) is an uncommon and highly aggressive form of lymphoma that represents less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
At present, few reports have focused on the imaging findings of MEITL, which poses significant challenges for clinical diagnosis.
