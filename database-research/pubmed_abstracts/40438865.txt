Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global health concern because of its rising prevalence and high fatality rates.
Conventional treatments for advanced HCC (aHCC) have limited success, emphasizing the need for novel treatment options.
Radiotherapy (RT) treatments, such as stereotactic body radiation and proton therapy, improve local tumor management via precision targeting.
Moreover, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target the programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1)/PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathways have promise for systemic antitumor effectiveness.
The combination of RT and ICIs takes advantage of their complementary mechanisms: RT kills immunogenic cells and controls the tumor microenvironment to increase antigen presentation, whereas ICIs enhance and maintain antitumor immune responses.
This combination enhances tumor regression and immune response in aHCC, improving response rate and progression-free survival with manageable safety.
The present review aimed to summarize the rationale for combining RT + ICIs in patients with aHCC and clinical outcomes, as well as ways to enhance this combination technique.
The combination of these models is a promising technique for improving outcomes for patients with aHCC and warrants further investigation.
