Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is among the most aggressive and lethal subtypes of breast cancer.
To date, there are no effective targeted treatment targets.
Sialylated IgG (SIA-IgG), with unique sialylated modifications for N-glycosylation at site 162 of the heavy chain of IgG, which was found to be expressed in a variety of cancer cells as a novel procancer factor.
Here, we aimed to investigate the expression frequency and procancer mechanisms of SIA-IgG in TNBC, and determine whether the SIA-IgG is a key factor that promotes TNBC and a novel target for TNBC therapy.
