High-cost (HC) patients, typically defined as the top 10% or 5% of patients with the highest health care costs, are responsible for over half of all health care-related spending.
In China, approximately 95% of rural residents are covered by Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance.
In parallel, increasing population mobility has made it more common for rural residents to seek medical treatment and claim reimbursements across provincial boundaries.
These trends underscore the importance of identifying and understanding HC patients within this group.
