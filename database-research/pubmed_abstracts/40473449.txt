Despite improved efficacy with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors plus platinum-based chemotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), survival remains poor.
In this study, we aimed to compare lurbinectedin plus atezolizumab and atezolizumab alone as maintenance therapies in patients with ES-SCLC without progression after induction therapy with atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide.
