Quantitative risk assessments of inhaled hexavalent chromium (CrVI) have primarily relied on studies of two chromate production worker cohorts, involving male workers exposed to high concentrations of airborne CrVI that caused an exposure-dependent increase in lung cancer and elicited severe respiratory irritation.
An additional larger cohort of CrVI-exposed aerospace workers, including women, and with lower intensity exposures, was recently updated with a longer follow-up period and reconstructed cumulative exposure estimates.
A risk assessment was conducted using a pooled analysis of individual-level dose-response information from three cohorts, including the aerospace workers, to generate lung cancer inhalation unit risk estimates (IURs).
IURs are estimates of the upper-bound of lifetime increased cancer risk from continuous inhalation exposure to 1 µg/m
