Targeted therapies and immunotherapy have improved treatment outcomes for many melanoma patients.
However, patients whose melanomas harbor driver mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene often lack effective targeted treatment options when their tumors do not respond to immunotherapy.
In this study, we utilized patient-derived short-term cultures (STCs) and multiomics approaches to identify molecular features that could inform the development of therapies for patients with NF1 mutant melanoma.
Differential gene expression analysis revealed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed and active in NF1 mutant melanoma cells, where it hyper-activates ERK and AKT, leading to increased tumor cell proliferation, survival, and growth.
In contrast, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of EGFR hindered cell proliferation and survival and suppressed tumor growth in patient-derived NF1 mutant melanoma models but not in NF1 wild-type models.
These results reveal a connection between NF1 loss and increased EGFR expression that is critical for the survival and growth of NF1 mutant melanoma cells in patient-derived culture and xenograft models, irrespective of their BRAF and NRAS mutation status.
