This study explored the experiences of women with South Asian ethnicity who received chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer in Norway.
Research on how they cope with radiotherapy, as well as the challenges they face in relation to cancer care, is crucial to generate new knowledge about the situation of minority women.
This study sought to promote a more equitable healthcare service and provide more personalised information for minority women.
