Breast cancer survivors undergoing cancer therapy are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
As a result, exercise has become a research hotspot in preventing decreased cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in breast cancer survivors.
However, there is no consensus on which type of exercise is the most effective in improving cardiorespiratory function of breast cancer survivors.
Therefore, this network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to compare the effects of different exercise therapies and explore the possible optimal choice to improve CRF in breast cancer survivors.
