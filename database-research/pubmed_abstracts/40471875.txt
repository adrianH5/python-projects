Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality among Asian-Americans.
Despite the potential of lung cancer screening (LCS) to detect disease at an earlier stage and reduce mortality, the uptake of LCS remains low.
This is particularly concerning among Asian subgroups with high smoking prevalence.
Additionally, there are scarce intervention programs tailored specifically for Asian-Americans.
The purpose of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate the Connect4LungHealth intervention to enhance LCS adoption and promote smoking cessation in high-risk Chinese and Korean communities via a Community-Health Worker (CHW)-driven approach integrated with mobile text messaging (TXT) strategies.
