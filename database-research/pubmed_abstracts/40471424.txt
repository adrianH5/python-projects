In our previous phase 2 trial, patients with locally advanced (LARC) or locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) received SGM-101, a CEA-targeted fluorescent agent, to enable real-time near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) guided surgery.
This study demonstrated that SGM-101 enabled additional tumor removal in some patients and supported less invasive surgery in others.
Despite this positive intraoperative effect, the impact on long-term tumor control is unknown.
Therefore, in this article we report the long-term outcomes of all rectal cancer patients that participated to the trial.
