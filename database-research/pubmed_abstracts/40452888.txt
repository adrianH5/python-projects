Musculoskeletal sarcomas represent heterogeneous and rare malignant bone and soft tissue tumors, affecting children and adults.
Patients exhibiting poor clinical outcomes are often described, being associated with non-response to chemotherapy, amputation needs, or metastatic disease.
Potential biomarkers contributing to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response could improve this scenario.
Despite this, little is known about the genomic aspects of musculoskeletal sarcomas.
DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mechanism, where changes in methylation profiling are characteristic hallmarks of cancer.
Cancer-related methylome profiling has been investigated both in tumor biopsies (genomic DNA) and liquid biopsies (cell-free DNA).
Epigenetic therapies by using DNA-demethylating drugs are promising strategies for cancer treatment.
This review will discuss translational studies describing how DNA methylation landscape of musculoskeletal sarcomas can be a powerful molecular tool to improve diagnostic accuracy, predict prognosis, and treatment response.
Additionally, this review will describe the promising role of epigenetics-targeted drugs as well as the ongoing clinical trials for sarcomas, highlighting the challenges and future directions.
