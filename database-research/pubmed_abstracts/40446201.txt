Tumor vasculature plays a crucial role in sustaining cancer progression, making vascular-targeted strategies highly promising for therapy.
Herein, we develop a vascular-targeted nanoplatform (ThT@ZRR) that synergistically integrates thrombin-induced thrombosis with hypoxia-activated chemotherapy to amplify antitumor immunity.
ThT@ZRR consists of thrombin and tirapazamine (TPZ) coloaded within ZIF-8 nanoparticles cloaked by RGD-modified red blood cell membranes.
Upon tumor accumulation, pH-responsive thrombin release induces localized thrombosis, disrupting blood flow and exacerbating hypoxia, which, in turn, enhances TPZ activation.
This cascade not only enhances direct tumor cell killing but also triggers robust immune responses.
The combined effects of thrombosis-induced inflammatory signals and TPZ-mediated immunogenic cell death promote dendritic cell maturation, CD8
