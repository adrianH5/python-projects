Uncommon and seldom discussed in the literature, the diagnosis of penile cysts relies on morphology and clinical correlation.
In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis of benign cysts encountered on penile glans, foreskin and shaft.
We discuss in more detail the median raphe cyst with its many names and patterns.
The aim of this review is to outline the diagnostic considerations and provide practical guidance for pathologists in diagnosing benign penile cysts.
