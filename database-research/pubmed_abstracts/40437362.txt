Paclitaxel (Taxol) is an invaluable secondary metabolite extracted from Taxus species, wildly utilized in cancer therapeutics.
Salicylic acid (SA), an important phytohormone, substantially elevates paclitaxel accumulation in Taxus cell suspension cultures.
However, the molecular mechanisms governing SA-induced modulation of paclitaxel biosynthesis remain poorly elucidated.
Our previous studies identified TcMYB73, an SA-responsive R2R3-MYB transcription factor (TF), which demonstrates a robust positive correlation with paclitaxel biosynthesis, implying its orchestrating role in this metabolic pathway.
