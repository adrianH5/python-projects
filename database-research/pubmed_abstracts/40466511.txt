Despite guidelines recommending oncologic colectomy (hemicolectomy with adequate lymphadenectomy) for high-risk appendiceal adenocarcinoma, some patients undergo nononcologic resection (NOR; appendectomy or ileocecectomy only).
Our study examines patients with high-risk appendiceal cancer who received NOR and examines the association with survival compared to oncologic colectomy.
