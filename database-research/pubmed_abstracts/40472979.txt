A chemical investigation of the fruits of Alpinia zerumbet resulted in the isolation of three undescribed diterpenoids, including an unusual tricyclic dinor-diterpenoid (1) and two labdane-type diterpenoids (2 and 4), a new diarylheptanoid (7), and a new tricyclic pyrone (9), along with four known compounds.
Their structures were fully established through a comprehensive analysis involving high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS), IR, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and TDDFT (time-dependent density functional theory) ECD (electronic circular dichroism) calculations.
The anti-inflammatory activities of isolated compounds were assessed in stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA-2-stimulated human THP1-Dual cells for their inhibitory effects on the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) pathway.
The results showed that compound 5 exhibited remarkable anti-inflammatory effect by significantly inhibiting the expression of IFN-Î², ISG-15, and IL-6 in MSA-2-stimulated human THP1-Dual cells.
