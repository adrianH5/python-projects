Ovarian cancer poses a significant threat to women's health, and the limitations of current treatments demand the exploration of new therapeutic solutions.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, a novel form of immunotherapy, has demonstrated substantial efficacy in the treatment of hematological malignancies and holds considerable promise for ovarian cancer treatment.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the application of CAR-T cell therapy in ovarian cancer, with a detailed discussion of therapeutic targets such as mesothelin, MUC16, and FOLR1, along with associated clinical trials.
Presently, the application of CAR-T cell therapy in ovarian cancer is confronted with challenges including immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor heterogeneity, target-related issues, toxic reactions, and limitations in cell efficacy.
To address these challenges, strategies such as modulating immunosuppressive cells, employing dual-target strategies, optimizing target selection and CAR structure, enhancing cell performance, and utilizing combination therapies are proposed.
Future research directions are likely to focus on the expansion of combination therapies, the application of nanotechnology, the advanced development of personalized medicine, and the exploration of immune cell diversification.
Although CAR-T cell therapy remains in its nascent stages for the treatment of ovarian cancer, ongoing research and technological advancements are anticipated to yield significant breakthroughs, potentially offering more effective treatment options for patients with ovarian cancer.
