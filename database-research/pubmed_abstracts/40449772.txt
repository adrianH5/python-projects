Stevioside and rebaudioside A revealed anticancer effects against diversity of cancers, such as colon, breast and liver cancers.
Rebaudioside A can trigger apoptosis in cancer cells via activation of caspase-dependent pathway.
In this study sodium alginate/poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) as nano-carriers loaded with natural products rebaudioside A (R) and/or stevioside (S) were assessed for anticancer activities.
The nanogel of structure R improved cytotoxicity against MCF-7, HepG2, HCT116 and A549 cancers by 60.29 %, 53.45 %, 72.86 % and 62.13 %, correspondingly.
Additionally, the nanogel of structure S improved cytotoxicity against MCF-7, HepG2, HCT116 and A549 cancers by 63.96 %, 53.41 %, 70.59 % and 52.88 %, respectively.
Furthermore, the nanogel for mixture of R/S improved cytotoxicity against MCF-7, HepG2, HCT116 and A549 cancers by 78.86 %, 54.75 %, 74.10 % and 56.53 % correspondingly.
Also, cytotoxic activities of structures R, S and R/S and their nanogels exhibited low toxicity on VERO cells with IC
