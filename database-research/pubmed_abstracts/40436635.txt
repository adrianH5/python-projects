Migraine is a complex neurological disorder lacking reliable assessment methods.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs relieve migraine pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis through COX-1 and COX-2 suppression.
As COX-2 plays a key role in pain and inflammation, its modulation is vital in migraine therapy.
We hypothesized that the COX-2 8473 T>C (rs5275) gene variant may be linked to migraine, depression, and nausea.
