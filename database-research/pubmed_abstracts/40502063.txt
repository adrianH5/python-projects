Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive intraocular malignancy with limited therapeutic options for metastatic disease.
Existing transgenic UM mouse models inadequately recapitulate human disease progression, while transplant models lack immune competence for studying the tumor immune microenvironment and therapeutic interventions.
To address these limitations, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model incorporating stepwise genetic alterations implicated in human UM progression.
