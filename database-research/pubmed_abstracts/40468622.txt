Many patients with pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (PitNETs) containing beta (Î²) thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-immunopositive cells, without syndrome of inappropriate secretion of TSH (SITSH), show a significant reduction in TSH levels following surgical removal of the tumour-like functioning thyrotroph PitNET.
We evaluated the pathophysiological and clinical characteristics of TSH-positive cells in PIT1-lineage PitNETs in patients without the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of TSH.
