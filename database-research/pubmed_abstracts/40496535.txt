Assessing patient satisfaction is an effective way to provide an evaluation of the quality of healthcare services.
As a result, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Patient Survey was established as the first standardized national survey to publicly report patient ratings on hospital care.
There remains a lack of research that examines rural-urban distinctions in patient satisfaction.
The objective of this study was to investigate if there is a difference in hospital determinants of patient satisfaction among hospitals based on rural status.
