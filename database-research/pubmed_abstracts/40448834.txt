Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States, and many colorectal cancer survivors often experience various symptoms significantly influenced by diet.
Although it is known that social determinants of health can lead to notable inequities that affect lifestyle and quality of life, limited studies have examined the interplay of social determinants of health and diet on symptom experiences in this population.
This scoping review aimed to explore relationships among social determinants of health, diet, and symptom experiences in colorectal cancer survivors.
