Primary breast leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare malignancy, accounting for approximately 1% of breast tumors and less than 5% of soft tissue sarcomas.

We report the case of a 38-year-old woman who presented with a 3 cm, freely mobile breast nodule, initially classified as American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 on imaging.
Core needle biopsy confirmed primary breast leiomyosarcoma, with histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis revealing strong positivity for Î±-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and H-caldesmon, consistent with smooth muscle differentiation.
Epithelial, neural, and vascular markers were negative, ruling out differential diagnoses.
The Ki-67 index was 15%, indicating moderate proliferative activity.
Staging classified the tumor as T2N0M0 (Stage IIA, the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8
