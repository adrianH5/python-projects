Acute myeloid leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia, AML) is a type of malignant hematological tumor characterized by high incidence, high mortality, and high recurrence rates.
Although chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have achieved certain therapeutic effects in recent years, immune evasion by tumor cells remains a key factor in the relapse and refractoriness of AML.
Current research suggests that arsenic trioxide (Arsenic Trioxide, ATO) can regulate autophagy and upregulate NKG2D ligands (NKG2D-L) on the surface of AML cells, while the NKG2D-NKG2D-L axis is negatively associated with AML immune evasion.
Our preliminary experimental studies have shown that the combination of curcumin (curcumin, CUR) and ATO can inhibit the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia KG-1a cells, induce apoptosis, and suppress the malignant progression and metastasis in AML mouse models.
However, the mechanisms underlying AML immune evasion have not yet been fully elucidated.
Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CUR combined with ATO in regulating autophagy in AML cells, activating the NKG2D-NKG2D-L axis, and inhibiting AML immune evasion both in vitro and in vivo.
