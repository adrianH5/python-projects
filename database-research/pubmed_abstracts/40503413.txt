Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have demonstrated significant potential as a research and treatment approach for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Nevertheless, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of TAMs in HCC remained insufficient.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to employ bibliometric methods to investigate the development trends and research frontiers pertaining to this field.
