Advanced cancer therapeutic strategies are rapidly evolving due to a better fundamental understanding of cancer cell biology and the complex tumor microenvironment.
There is a need for better rational design of bioresponsive nanotherapeutics to take cues from the tumor microenvironment and better facilitate the intracellular delivery of multiple cancer therapeutic agents.
Biodegradable, cationic nanogels were synthesized via a UV-initiated free radical emulsion polymerization to impart environmentally responsive behavior for the intracellular delivery of immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic agents.
The 2-(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate based copolymeric nanogels exhibited pH responsive behavior that was optimized for the pH gradient of the tumor microenvironment and endosomal compartments of cancer cells.
Then, the cationic nanogels were assessed for their ability to load and release various chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents.
Finally, the copolymeric nanoparticle system was evaluated in vitro for biocompatibility, cellular internalization, and therapeutic efficacy.
This combination treatment strategy will provide an excellent foundation for the rational design and development of the next generation of drug delivery systems.
