Repression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) is facilitated by KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1)-containing complexes, however the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
Here, we show that binding of KAP1 to the major component of the heterochromatin spreading and maintenance network, HP1Î±, plays a critical role in silencing of repetitive elements.
Structural, biochemical and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the association of the HP1 box of KAP1 (KAP1
