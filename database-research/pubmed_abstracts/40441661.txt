Lithium is a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, especially BD-I.
In addition to efficacy in treating acute mania and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder, lithium's anti-suicide effects have been documented in studies showing reduced rates of completed suicide and serious attempts.
To update current knowledge on the topic, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of lithium's impact in randomized controlled trials on suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation, attempts, and suicide).
