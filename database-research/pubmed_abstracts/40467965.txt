Cancer survivors have reported difficulties in accessing loan-related insurance, in particular for a home loan.
In France, a law called "the Right To Be Forgotten" (RTBF) was adopted in 2017 to counter this "financial toxicity" of cancer.
Since then, eight other European countries have adopted or implemented legislation inspired by the French RTBF.
Several patients' organizations in Europe have called for an extension of the RTBF across all European countries.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the RTBF on the reduction of survivors experiencing difficulties in obtaining loan-related insurance after cancer in France.
