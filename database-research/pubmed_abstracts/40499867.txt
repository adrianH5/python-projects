Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women, accounting for 23.8 % of all female cancer cases.
Existing therapies often lack tumor specificity, leading to severe off-target toxicity, dose-limiting side effects, and poor patient compliance.
These limitations underscore the urgent need for innovative strategies that enhance therapeutic precision.
AS1411 aptamer-based nanomaterials have emerged as a transformative solution, leveraging the aptamer's high-affinity binding to nucleolin, a receptor overexpressed on breast cancer cells, to enable targeted drug delivery, imaging, and combinatorial therapies.
This review explores the potential applications of AS1411-based nanoformulations and discussed various nanoformulations for the same in the treatment of breast cancer.
Notably, categorizing advancements into platforms including DNA nanocarriers (e.g., MUC1-Td-AS1411 nanoscaffold), which enhance drug retention and therapeutic outcomes; polymeric nanoparticles (e.g., AS1411-functionalized AuNBP-Gd₂O₃/dBSA), which provide controlled release and improved cellular uptake; and metallic nanoparticles (e.g., AS1411-functionalized AuNBP-Gd₂O₃/dBSA), which enable dual-modal imaging and effective tumor ablation.
These advancements highlight the multifunctional potential of AS1411-based nanoformulations in advancing breast cancer treatment, which combine precise targeting with reduced systemic toxicity, and compatibility.
However, challenges such as large-scale synthesis complexity, immunogenicity of DNA-based carriers, and regulatory barriers must be addressed to facilitate clinical translation.
Collaborative efforts to optimize scalable manufacturing and conduct comprehensive immunotoxicity studies will be pivotal in advancing these nanotherapeutics from preclinical promise to clinical reality, ultimately offering a safer, more effective paradigm for breast cancer treatment.
