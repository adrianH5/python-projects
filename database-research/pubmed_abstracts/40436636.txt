Surgery for cervical cancer is a known risk factor for hospital readmission, often due to urological, lymphovascular, or neurological complications.
While comorbidities are commonly used to assess surgical risk, patient-reported measures like baseline quality of life (QoL) may also help predict complications.
This study aimed to estimate how often surgical complications occur and what factors predict them, with a focus on baseline QoL.
