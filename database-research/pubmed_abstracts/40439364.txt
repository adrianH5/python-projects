Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the leading form of primary liver cancer, is strongly associated with liver cirrhosis and major risk factors such as hepatitis B and C, alcohol consumption, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Despite treatment advancements, survival rates for unresectable HCC remain low.
Lenvatinib and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (ATE/BEV) show promise, but further studies are needed to compare their clinical outcomes.
This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of LEN and ATE/BEV in unresectable HCC patients.
