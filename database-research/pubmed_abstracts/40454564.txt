Photothermal therapy (PTT) faces critical limitations due to tumor hypoxia, intrinsic resistance, and metastasis.
To address these challenges, we developed a trimodal nanoplatform (R-R/PB@PPy NEs) by synergizing Prussian blue (PB)/polypyrrole (PPy) nanozymes, tumor suppressor reactivation, and immune modulation.
