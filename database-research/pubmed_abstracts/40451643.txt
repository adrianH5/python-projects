Gastric cancer is a pressing global health issue that ranks fifth as the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and leading cause of cancer-related deaths.
Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes, with five-year survival rates exceeding 90Â % when diagnosed at initial stages.
Current screening modalities, primarily reliant on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, are highly accurate, but not without limitations, such as invasiveness, high cost, low adherence and accessibility.
Hence, this review aligns with the ongoing efforts to answer the pressing need for innovative approaches, emphasising novel devices and biomarker advancements over the last decade.
We highlight non-endoscopic methods such as magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy and point-of-care testing.
Additionally, we will provide an overview into the field of liquid biopsies and emerging biomarkers in GC detection, towards accurate, less invasive and costly screening tools that hold the promise for greater accessibility and citizen involvement.
