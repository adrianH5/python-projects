Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy, predominantly affecting children and adolescents.
Current treatment approaches have limited efficacy, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 60%.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in the onset, progression, and metastasis of OS, potentially influencing patient prognosis.
