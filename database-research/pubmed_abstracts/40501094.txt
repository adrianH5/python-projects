Exosomes (Exos) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to influence cancer cell behavior; however, the clinical use of MSCs is limited due to the gradual loss of their differentiation potential with continuous passaging.
Induced mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative source, but the effects of Exos derived from iMSCs (iMSC-Exos) on cancer cells remain incompletely understood.
This study aims to compare the effects of iMSC-Exos with ADMSC-Exos derived from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) on the viability, invasion, and migration of breast (MCF7) and lung (A549) cancer cells.
Conditioned media from iMSCs and ADMSCs were collected for isolation and characterization of Exos.
MCF7 and A549 cell lines were treated with iMSC- and ADMSC-Exos, and Exos uptake, cell viability, migration, senescence, and expression of
