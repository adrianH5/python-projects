Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma.
When metastatic, survival of children with RMS is less than 20% and has remained unchanged over two decades.
No targeted drug therapy is available for these cancers.
Genomic analysis has revealed a low incidence of somatic mutations in RMS.
Epigenetic modifiers thus play important roles in driving oncogenesis.
In this study, we examined the role of EHMT1 in fusion- negative embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), the most frequent subtype of RMS.
