The DESTINY-Breast06 study demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival benefit with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) versus chemotherapy treatment of physician's choice in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) whose tumors were scored as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+, or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization (ISH)-negative] and who had received one or more lines of endocrine therapy and no previous chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.
An exploratory analysis consistently showed a benefit for patients with HER2-low and HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) expression.
