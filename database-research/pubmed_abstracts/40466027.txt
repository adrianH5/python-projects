Recurrence occurs in 20%-30% of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment drives radiation resistance, immune evasion, and tumor progression.
Biomarkers measuring hypoxia may be useful for prognostication of NSCLC treated with SBRT.
We investigate an RNA-based approach to measure tumor hypoxia and associate these molecular biomarkers with clinical outcomes after SBRT.
