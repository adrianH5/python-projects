Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (II/R) injury is a serious condition characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates.
Research has shown that II/R injury is closely linked to autophagy and immune dysregulation.
This study aims to investigate the potential correlations between autophagy-related genes and infiltrating immune cells in II/R injury.
