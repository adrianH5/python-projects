Neuroblastoma, the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor, has heterogeneous clinical outcomes ranging from malignant progression to spontaneous regression.

Spontaneous regression is often accompanied by tumor differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unclear.
