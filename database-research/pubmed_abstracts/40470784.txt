The efficacy of sequential adjuvant chemotherapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in older patients with glioblastoma multiforme is limited.
Previous studies have reported that controlling tumor recurrence by increasing the electric field intensity in the tumor region can extend the survival of older patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
This report describes the case of a woman with glioblastoma multiforme in her early 60s from China who was initially admitted to Shenzhen People's Hospital with impaired consciousness and limb weakness.
Based on her medical history and magnetic resonance imaging findings, she was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme with subfalcine herniation.
After undergoing decompressive craniectomy in addition to receiving concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, she achieved long-term survival benefits by maintaining tumor electric field therapy.
