•The TEDDI trial investigated deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) in children.•Setup reproducibility for DIBH or free breathing (FB) was assessed.•Translations were significantly smaller for DIBH vs. FB, but systematic and random errors were similar.•We found setup reproducibility of DIBH comparable to FB, and no need for larger margins.
