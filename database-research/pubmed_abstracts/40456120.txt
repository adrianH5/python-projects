Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of great clinical and biologic heterogeneity; some patients are observed for years without symptoms, while others rapidly develop progressive disease requiring treatment.
With therapy, some patients eventually develop resistant CLL or transformation to an aggressive form.
Across this spectrum, patients experience immune dysfunction associated with increased risk for infection and second cancers, contributing to morbidity and mortality of the disease.
The ultimate therapeutic bullseye for CLL is to eliminate the disease and achieve immune restoration.
Disease elimination can potentially be achieved for a fraction of patients treated first-line with chemoimmunotherapy (FCR), for some patients who receive time-limited combined targeted therapy, and for some patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant.
Long-term immune restoration for these patients is elusive.
Current targeted therapies, including BTK- and BCL2-inhibitors and CD20 monoclonal antibodies used in combinations, can produce exceptional therapeutic outcomes, which are improving survival for patients who need treatment.
While clear progress has been made toward highly effective CLL management, appreciation of the full impact of these advances will require time due to the chronic nature of the disease.
Additionally, it is imperative to ensure global access to the targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for harmonized regulatory oversight and affordable treatment options worldwide.
Here, we discuss research and collaborative strategies to refine the use of targeted agents to eliminate CLL and restore immune function for all affected individuals.
