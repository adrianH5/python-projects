The 5-item modified frailty index (5-mFI) is used to predict clinical outcomes in breast reconstruction, but its relationship to patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after two-stage implant-based reconstruction (IBR) is unclear.
This study evaluates how frailty is associated with clinical outcomes and PROs using the BREAST-Q.
We hypothesized that higher 5-mFI scores would correlate with poorer outcomes and PROs.
