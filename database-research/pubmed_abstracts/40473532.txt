The plasticity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) refers to their ability to adopt a spectrum of distinct phenotypes or states in response to dynamic changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled detailed characterization of the heterogeneity and spatial complexity of CAF subpopulations across multiple tumor types.
Notably, CAF subtypes undergo dynamic transitions during tumor progression and therapy pressure.
This review systematically summarizes the current knowledge on CAF plasticity shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, delineates research gaps, and highlights CAF phenotypic switching as a potential therapeutic opportunity.
