Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.
The current standard of care for patients with early-stage CRC includes surgical resection and, in selected patients, adjuvant chemotherapy.
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing is an important component of liquid biopsy, and with the development of testing technology, its value for clinical application has attracted widespread attention.
The aim of this study was to help researchers review what has been achieved and better understand the direction of future research through bibliometric analysis.
