The current problem associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) pneumonia, which is frequently encountered in clinical settings, is drug resistance.
If Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia can be rapidly diagnosed in early stage, the occurrence of drug resistance can be reduced.
Therefore, our study aimed to investigate pulmonary metabolic changes associated with PA pneumonia and to identify relevant metabolic biomarkers and key metabolic pathways, providing a reference for rapid diagnosis.
