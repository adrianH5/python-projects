Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a transformative analytical tool in disease diagnostics, offering unparalleled sensitivity and molecular fingerprinting capabilities.
However, its clinical translation is hindered by the inherent complexity of spectral data, including noise interference, overlapping peaks, and labor-intensive manual analysis.
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has opened new frontiers in SERS-driven diagnostics by enabling automated data processing, robust feature extraction, and high-accuracy classification.
This article systematically explores the synergistic potential of AI/ML and SERS in advancing disease detection, with a focus on cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.
We highlight cutting-edge methodologies and explainable AI tools designed to enhance clinical trustworthiness.
Case studies demonstrate the efficacy of AI/ML-SERS integration in early cancer detection, rapid pathogen identification, and monitoring neurodegenerative disease progression.
Despite these advancements, challenges such as limited datasets, model interpretability, and hardware-software integration remain critical barriers to clinical application.
Future directions emphasize multimodal learning, portable SERS-AI devices, and standardized validation protocols.
By bridging the gap between nanotechnology, biomedicine, and computational science, this interdisciplinary approach holds promise for redefining precision diagnostics.
