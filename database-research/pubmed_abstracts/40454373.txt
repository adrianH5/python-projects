Lupeol, a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid, has gained significant attention for its diverse pharmacological properties, making lupeol a promising therapeutic candidate for chronic disease management.
This review explores recent advancements in lupeol research, emphasizing its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and wound-healing effects.
Lupeol exerts potent anti-inflammatory activity by modulating key signaling pathways, such as NF-ÎºB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt, thereby reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with chronic conditions like arthritis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.
Its potent antioxidant capacity helps mitigate oxidative stress, a major contributor to chronic ailments.
Additionally, lupeol demonstrates anticancer properties by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, and enhancing the efficacy of conventional therapies.
Emerging studies highlight its cardioprotective role in preventing atherosclerosis and myocardial injury as well as its neuroprotective potential in combating neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Despite its promising therapeutic benefits, challenges, such as poor bioavailability and limited clinical translation, remain significant hurdles.
This review underscores the need for advanced drug delivery strategies and further clinical investigations to unlock the full potential of lupeol as a viable therapeutic alternative for chronic diseases.
