Recent studies in lung cancer pathology have focused on histological patterns related to prognosis, such as spread through air spaces (STAS) and histological grading.
In contrast, the anatomical depth of invasion of lung cancer has not been well studied, and currently, only visceral pleura and main bronchus are the lung-specific structures that determine the T category of lung cancer.
