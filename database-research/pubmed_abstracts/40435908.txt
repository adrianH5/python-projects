Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with a poor prognosis.
Previous studies have indicated that solute carrier family 38 member 5 (SLC38A5), an amino acid transporter, plays an important role in some solid tumors.
However, the role and mechanism of SLC38A5 in the progression of CRC are poorly deÔ¨Åned.
