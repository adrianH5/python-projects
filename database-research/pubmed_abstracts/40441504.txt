Purpose To investigate the association between hormonal contraceptive use and the risk of retinal vascular occlusions in women of reproductive age.
Design Register-based, nationwide cohort study.
Participants A total of 2208172 women aged 15 - 49 years were followed from January 1, 1996, to June 30, 2021, excluding those with prior venous or arterial thrombosis, thrombophilia, cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), liver disease, chronic kidney disease, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, hormone therapy, infertility treatment, endometriosis, or polycystic ovary syndrome.
Methods Women were followed until study end, age 50, emigration, death, or occurrence of exclusion criteria.
Individual-level, time-updated hormonal contraception use was identified through prescription records; retinal vascular occlusion events were detected through hospital diagnoses.
Poisson regression models estimated incidence rate ratios of retinal vascular occlusion by duration, dosage, and type of hormonal contraceptives, adjusting for age, educational level, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation/flutter during observation.
Main Outcome Measures Adjusted incidence rate ratios (AIRR) and standardized incidence rate differences (SIRD) of retinal vein occlusion and retinal artery occlusion with hormonal contraceptive use compared to non-use.
Results The cohort contributed 23882016 person-years with a median follow-up time of 10 years (1
