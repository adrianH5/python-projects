Minimally invasive approaches, including video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (VATT) and robot-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (RATT), have emerged as alternatives to median sternotomy for resectable thymic epithelial tumours (TETs).
However, their comparative clinical efficacy remains inconclusive due to limited prospective evidence.
This phase II randomised controlled trial aims to provide the first direct comparative analysis of perioperative outcomes between RATT and VATT in stage I-II TETs.
