Recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with curative surgery or ablation follows a bimodal pattern, with early recurrence peaking at 6 months to 1 year, and late recurrence peaking at 3 to 4 years.
We postulate the use of antiviral therapies could reduce late recurrence due to better control of chronic inflammation.
