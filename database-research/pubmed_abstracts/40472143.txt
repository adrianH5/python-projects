This report describes the use of laser angiography to assess anastomosis perfusion in a 9-year-old girl who underwent rotationplasty for osteosarcoma resection.
Perfusion of the reconstructed limb is traditionally assessed postoperatively.
Delays in addressing inadequate perfusion can lead to morbid complications such as return to the operating room or conversion to amputation.
In this patient, laser angiography was used to evaluate anastomosis perfusion intraoperatively, ensuring avoidance of these complications.
