Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic inflammatory disease of the esophagus that exerts a significant clinical and financial burden in developed countries.
Despite an emerging interest in this disease, the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving EoE pathogenesis remain elusive.
Addressing this knowledge gap is critical to guide the development of novel approaches for diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy in EoE patients.
As EoE is an allergic inflammatory disorder that results in esophageal inflammation and tissue remodeling,
