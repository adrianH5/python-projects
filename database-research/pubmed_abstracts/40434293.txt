Objective: This study aimed to assess the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFR!/") in primary tumor cells of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Methods: Platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta expression was analyzed in RCC specimens from 65 RCC patients (pT1a-T4NanyMany) using immunohis- tochemistry.
Expression levels were quantified using the semi-quantitative H-score (HS) method, and correlations between PDGFR!/" expression and tumor characteris- tics were evaluated.
The impact of PDGFR!/" expression on patient survival was also examined.
Results: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha was expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of 58.5% of primary RCC cells, with an HS of 62.9 ± 8.4, significantly higher than PDGFR" expression (44.6%; 26.6 ± 5.3; P > .05).
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha expression correlated with tumor grade (r = 0.471; P < .0001) and the pN+ category (r = 0.280; P = .024).
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta expression correlated with tumor grade (r = 0.286; P = .021), venous tumor thrombosis (r = 0.263; P = .034), M+ category (r = 0.305; P = .014), and adrenal metastases (r = 0.306; P = .041).
Neither PDGFR!
nor PDGFR" expression levels influenced patient survival.
Conclusion: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha was more highly expressed in RCC cells compared to PDGFR".
Overexpression of PDGFR!/" was associated with higher tumor grade and advanced RCC stages, though it did not affect patient survival.
