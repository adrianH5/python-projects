Cancer remains a leading cause of death among women globally, with breast, colorectal, and cervical cancers being the most prevalent.
Despite established screening programs, low adherence rates persist, contributing to the continued high incidence of these cancers.
Among the many influencing factors, sociocultural beliefs play a significant role in shaping women's health behaviours, often resulting in poor participation in screening initiatives.
This systematic review aims to provide a thorough analysis of the impact of sociocultural factors on women's adherence to breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening.
