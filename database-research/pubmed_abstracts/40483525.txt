Glioma, a common malignancy of the central nervous system, attracts significant clinical attention due to its poor prognosis.
Glioma stem cells (GSCs), characterized by stem-like properties and substantial heterogeneity, play a crucial role in tumor initiation, progression, and potential recurrence.
Moreover, through complex interaction mechanisms, they contribute to the challenges associated with treatment.
This review seeks to explore the distinctive characteristics and underlying mechanisms of GSCs, aiming to provide novel theoretical insights and practical strategies for precision therapy in glioma.
