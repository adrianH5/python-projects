Total mesorectal excision (TME) without lateral pelvic lymph node (LPN) dissection (LPND) is feasible in patients with mid/low rectal cancer showing a reduction in LPN size to â‰¤5 mm following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT).
We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of selective LPNDs based on these criteria.
