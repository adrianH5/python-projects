Background This study aimed to determine the accuracy of the muscle-retracting sign (MRS) to detect deep submucosal invasion (SMI) in early rectal cancer.
Methods In this prospective, observational, single-centre study consecutive rectal lesions that underwent endoscopic resection using the pocket-detection method (PDM) between August 2023 and March 2025 were included.
Directionality of initial submucosal dissection targeted any morphological or surface vascular pattern at risk of deep SMI to attempt MRS identification.
Histopathology was the reference standard for MRS diagnostic accuracy in detecting deep SMI.
Results 38 rectal lesions, median size 30 mm (IQR 20), were included.
PDM for MRS detection was successful in all cases, with MRS-positive in 15/38 (39.5%).
Deep SMI was confirmed in 15/38 (39.5%).
Accuracy of MRS-positive for deep SMI detection was 84.2%, (95% CI 69.6-92.6%), sensitivity 80% (95% CI 54.8-92.9%), specificity 87% (95% CI 67.9-95.5%), positive likelihood ratio 6.13, negative likelihood ratio 0.23, area under the curve 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71-0.96).
The rate of R0 resection was 92.1% (35/38).
Conclusions MRS detected using the PDM demonstrated moderate-to-high accuracy in predicting deep SMI in early rectal cancer.
This finding may allow the precise selection of an endoscopic resection strategy based on invasion depth for the minimally invasive treatment of early rectal cancer.
