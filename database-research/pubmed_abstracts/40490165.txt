Autophagy plays dual roles in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter.
It maintains cellular integrity by removing damaged components to prevent tumor initiation; however, in established cancers, autophagy may facilitate tumor growth and survival under stress.
This complexity highlights the potential of targeting autophagy to enhance the effectiveness of conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation.
In this context, theranostic exosomes (EXOs) emerge as a pivotal advancement in precision medicine, functioning as both biomarkers and targeted drug delivery systems.
Their unique ability to integrate therapeutic and diagnostic functions positions them at the forefront of personalized treatment strategies for cancer.
Moreover, the interplay between EXOs and autophagy is vital for cellular communication and immune modulation, significantly influencing cancer progression and treatment outcomes.
As research continues to explore EXO biology and its relationship with autophagy, challenges such as EXO extraction, cargo loading, and safety must be addressed to fully realize their clinical potential.
Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the multifaceted roles of EXOs in mediating autophagy will pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis and improving patient outcomes.
