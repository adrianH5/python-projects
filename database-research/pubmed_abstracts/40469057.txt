Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for haematological malignancies can cause acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), impacting graft success and mortality.
Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) or post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is effective in reducing GvHD in haploidentical-HSCT.
This review included 17 studies to assess rATG + PTCy for GvHD prophylaxis.
Overall acute GvHD grade II-IV, moderate-to-severe chronic GvHD and GvHD-free relapse-free survival rates ranged from 11.50%-35.40%, 2.90%-17.78% and 21.80%-63%, respectively.
Although r-ATG + PTCy treatment lowered GvHD incidence and increased survival rates, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation were observed; therefore, more investigations on this treatment are needed, especially on dosing and timing when used for HSCT.
