Targeted cancer therapy remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of tumor microenvironments and the need for precise drug delivery systems that can overcome these obstacles.
To address this challenge, a nanoparticle platform based on prodrug activation and immune enhancement for "two-missile" targeting of TNBC has been developed: Azido-HA@Cu
