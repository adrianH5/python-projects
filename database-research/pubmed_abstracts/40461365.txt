Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is staged using CT imaging generally reported in a narrative prose style, which can omit key details critical for an operating surgeon.
This study assessed sixty-three potential radiological descriptors derived from the International Consensus Guidelines (ICG) to classify the resectability status of PDAC to determine whether reports adequately staged PDAC.
