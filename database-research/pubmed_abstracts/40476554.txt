Following the publication of the above article, the authors drew to the Editor's attention that they has misclassified some of their original data, and this led to the erroneous compilation of the cell invasion and scratch wound assay data shown in Fig.
5A and B respectively on p. 604.
Moreover, the authors realized that the same GAPDH control western blotting data had inadvertently been included in Fig.
4A and G on p. 603, where these data were correctly shown only for Fig.
4G.
However, the authors had retained their original data for these figures, and the revised versions of Figs.
4 and 5, now showing the correct data for the GAPDH bands in Fig.
4A and the correct data for Fig.
5A and B, are shown on the next two pages.
Note that the errors made in terms of the assembly of the data in these figures did not affect the overall conclusions reported in the paper.
