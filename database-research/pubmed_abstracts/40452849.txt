Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DIILD) is a serious complication of cancer treatment that is primarily treated with corticosteroids.
However, effective standardized regimens for corticosteroid-refractory DIILD have not been established.
Cyclophosphamide (CPA) is an immunosuppressant that is potentially effective against DIILD, but supporting evidence is limited, particularly for diseases induced by novel chemotherapeutic drugs.
In this study, we examined the efficacy and safety of CPA in corticosteroid-refractory DIILD caused by various anticancer drugs.
