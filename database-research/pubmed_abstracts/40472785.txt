Compared to the first near-infrared (NIR-I) window (650-1000 nm), the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window (1000-1700 nm) is more valuable for photothermal treatment (PTT) due to its deeper tissue penetration and lower phototoxicity.
However, the therapeutic efficacy of PTT remains suboptimal owing to the inherently low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of existing materials.
Therefore, the development of nanomaterials with high PCE is a promising strategy for improving anti-tumor therapy.
In this study, hollow semimetal PtTe
