Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation is closely associated with poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EBV reactivation in NPC progression remain unclear.
This study aimed to identify key genes and pathways involved in EBV reactivation using an integrated multi-omics approach.
