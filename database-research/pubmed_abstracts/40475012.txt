Doxorubicin (DOX) is a primary treatment for breast cancer (BC), but its widespread use is hindered by cardiotoxicity.
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has been developed to enhance the efficacy of DOX and mitigate its cardiotoxic effects.
However, PLD is associated with adverse reactions (ADRs) such as hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and oral mucositis (OM), which have garnered significant attention.
Although not life-threatening, HFS and OM can cause severe discomfort and functional impairment.
Severe cases may necessitate a reduced PLD dose or even delay or interrupt chemotherapy, ultimately leading to decreased medication compliance.
Here, we conduct an analysis of the risk factors associated with HFS and OM during the PLD chemotherapy regimen, thus providing early warning indicators for the potential occurrence of these adverse reactions in BC patients.
