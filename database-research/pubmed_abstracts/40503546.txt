Gallbladder volvulus is a rare but potentially fatal condition that may present with symptoms mimicking intra-abdominal malignancy, including constitutional symptoms and mass-like imaging findings.
We present the case of an 85-year-old female on chronic anticoagulation with warfarin, who was evaluated for an epigastric mass initially suspected to be lymphoma or colon cancer.
CT imaging revealed a large, heterogeneous mass in the epigastric region, while ultrasound demonstrated significant gallbladder distention, wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid.
This report highlights the challenges in obtaining an accurate diagnosis and stresses the urgent need for swift imaging and intervention to distinguish between surgical emergencies and oncologic-related conditions in elderly patients.
