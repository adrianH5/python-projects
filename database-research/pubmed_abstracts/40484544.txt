β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) is widely acknowledged as a crucial biomarker for primary ovarian cancer.
Therefore, precise analysis of β-Gal plays a significant role in the early diagnosis of primary ovarian cancer.
In contrast to organic molecule probes, silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) have garnered significant attention owing to their outstanding photoluminescence stability and good biocompatibility.
Nevertheless, most nanomaterials synthesized under stringent conditions generally produce a single signal that is susceptible to various external influences.
Thus, there is an urgent need to develop multi-mode sensing techniques based on Si NPs synthesized under mild conditions for the measurement of β-Gal.
