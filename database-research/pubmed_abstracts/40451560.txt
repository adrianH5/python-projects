As fundamental components of the innate immune system, both cGAS and STING serve as the primary cytosolic DNA sensors and its downstream adaptor protein, respectively.
The cGAS-STING signaling axis is activated through DNA recognition and has emerged as a pivotal regulator mediating three key processes: autophagy, apoptosis, and critical biological functions ranging from pro-inflammatory responses to antiviral/antitumor defenses.
Recent breakthroughs in tumor immunology have established immunotherapy as the fourth pillar of cancer treatment, alongside traditional approaches such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
Advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of cGAS-STING signaling have uncovered its dual regulatory potential in tumorigenesis - capable of orchestrating both tumoricidal immune activation and paradoxical tumor progression through microenvironment modulation.
The deepening knowledge of its immunological interplay provides a robust theoretical foundation for developing combinatorial strategies.
These strategies integrate pathway modulation with immunotherapeutic interventions.
Building upon existing research paradigms in cancer immunotherapy, this review specifically focuses on recent progress in exploiting cGAS-STING agonists as next-generation immunotherapeutic agents.
