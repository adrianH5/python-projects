Effort-reward imbalance (ERI) is a prevalent issue in the healthcare sector, particularly in the high-intensity, high-risk, and high-stress environment of the emergency department.
This results in emergency department nurses bearing heavier workloads, responsibilities, and time commitments compared to their counterparts in other departments.
ERI poses significant risks to their physical, psychological, and sleep quality.
Therefore, it is essential to explore the mechanisms through which ERI influences the health of emergency department nurses.
