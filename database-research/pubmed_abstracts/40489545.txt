Vincristine (VCR)-based anticancer drugs show significant potential in improving treatment results for aggressive malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC).
This study presents a core - shell iron nanoparticle system (IR780@VCR@GA-Fe-BSA@PLGA, termed as PVIBs) that combines VCR chemotherapy, sonodynamic treatment (SDT) utilizing IR780, and Fenton reaction-improved oxidative stress.
The technology exhibited pH-response release of therapeutic compounds, synergic anticancer effects, and mitochondrial targeting when coupled with ultrasonic (US) irradiation.
PVIBs markedly elevated ROS generation, exacerbated mitochondrial impairment, and augmented apoptosis rates in colorectal cancer therapies.
These findings underscore the promise of this US-enhanced nanoplatform in tackling problems related to colorectal cancer treatment, providing a highly successful and least intrusive therapeutic approach.
