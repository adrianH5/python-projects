Heart failure, marked by rising morbidity and mortality rates, poses a significant health challenge.
Recent studies suggest that deubiquitinating modification of proteins in cardiomyocytes is involved in the development of heart failure.
YOD1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) implicated in various diseases, including breast cancer, hematological tumors, pancreatic cancer, and vascular endothelial diseases.
In this study, we investigated the role of YOD1 in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy.
Mice were administered isoproterenol (ISO, 30 mg·kg
