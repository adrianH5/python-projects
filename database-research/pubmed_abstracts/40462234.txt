Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) is a significant concern for cancer survivors, while genetic basis of ACT remains unclear.
This study employs a murine genetic reference population (GRP) of BXD recombinant inbred strains, derived from DBA/2J (D2) and C57BL/6J (B6) crosses, to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to doxorubicin (DOX)-induced phenotypes through systems genetics approaches.
