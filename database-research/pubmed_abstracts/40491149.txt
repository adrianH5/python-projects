The article reports a case of a 19-year-old woman diagnosed with alveolar adenoma.
The patient presented to our hospital with cough and sputum production.
Initial chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-defined, round nodule (1.8 cm in diameter) in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe.
Follow-up CT at 6 months demonstrated nodule enlargement to 2.0 cm.
After excluding surgical contraindications, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection of the left upper lobe lesion.
Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the diagnosis of alveolar adenoma.
Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and no recurrence or metastasis was observed during the 6-month follow-up period.
Notably, alveolar adenoma typically occurs in middle-aged and elderly populations, making this case the youngest reported to date.
