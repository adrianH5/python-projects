Pediatric patients with hematologic and oncologic diagnoses are at high risk of disease- and/or treatment-related symptoms, and families often seek complementary services alongside disease-directed therapy.
Integrative medicine (IM) services can be effective holistic tools for symptom management and support, and are included in multiple NCCN supportive care guidelines.
Despite recommendations that IM be included in comprehensive cancer care, availability and access remain variable across cancer centers, and the utilization of IM services-specifically for children-remains largely unknown.
To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a retrospective review of 18 months of clinical metrics for a newly formed pediatric IM service at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (St. Jude) to assess referral trends and patterns of IM utilization in a pediatric cancer center.
