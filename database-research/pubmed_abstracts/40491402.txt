Rapid access to safe and effective oncological therapies is crucial.
In recent years, many expensive drugs have been commercialized, making it essential to prioritize those with significant clinical benefits.
For this purpose, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) introduced the ESMO-MCBS (Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale), which assigns a score to quantify the clinical benefit of treatments.
This study aims to evaluate whether there is a correlation between the ESMO-MCBS score and drug access times in Italy.
