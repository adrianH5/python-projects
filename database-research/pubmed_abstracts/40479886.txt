Peripheral artery disease (PAD) significantly contributes to increased morbidity and mortality among older adults.
Characterized by generalized endothelial dysfunction, PAD is associated with a heightened risk for cerebral small vessel disease and vascular cognitive impairment.
Together, these conditions exemplify the phenomenon of accelerated systemic vascular aging, highlighting the interconnections between vascular health and cognitive functions in the elderly.
This pilot trial investigated the potential of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of NAD
