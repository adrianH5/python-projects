Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is the gold standard treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) which is responsible for central vision loss.
This results in loss of quality of life, comparably severe to having coronary artery disease or cancer.
New anti-VEGF agents need to address issues of potency and durability as existing agents tend to lose their effect after 1 month thus, requiring multiple injections at close intervals.
Brolucizumab is one of the latest anti-VEGF agents clinically proven to treat nAMD after on-label agents namely, ranibizumab and aflibercept.
Several clinical trials were conducted on Brolucizumab to ensure its safety and efficiency before it is approved to be used as treatment.
Brolucizumab maintains and improves retinal edema in nAMD leading to improved vision with longer intervals possible between injections.
However, it also has a risk of intraocular inflammation.
This review summarizes the evidence for brolucizumab in the treatment of nAMD.
