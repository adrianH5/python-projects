Astragaloside IV (ASIV), a natural compound from Astragalus membranaceus, exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in various pathologies.
Its role in Plasmodium yoelii (Py) 17XL-induced inflammation leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage remains undefined.
Artesunate (ART), the frontline therapy for severe malaria, has encountered resistance and unresolved neurological sequelae.
This study investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of ASIV combined with ART in Py-infected mice.
