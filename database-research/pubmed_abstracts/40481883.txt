Infectious diseases, particularly viral infections, pose a significant threat to human health by contributing to cancer progression and metastasis.
This review presents a novel perspective on how advanced biological models such as organoids, organ-on-a-chip systems, spheroids, and 3D bioprinting bridge critical translational gaps in research.
These models replicate human physiological processes, allowing for the investigation of molecular mechanisms and the evaluation of novel therapeutics.
This review will explore the current state of advanced biological models used to study viral infections associated with metastasis to better understand how viral-induced changes impact tumor behavior and the implications for future treatment strategies.
