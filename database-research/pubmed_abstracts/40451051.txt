In recent years, menopause awareness has been increasing in several European countries; however, gaps in menopause knowledge, attitudes and practices persist.
This review provides an overview of the women's current menopausal experience in Italy, Spain and Portugal, and gives POESIT (Portugal + Spain + Italy) group recommendations to address persistent barriers in menopause care.
The perception, occurrence and impact of menopause symptoms vary among countries, with genitourinary syndrome of menopause and vasomotor symptoms being the most frequent overall.
Sexuality seems to be particularly affected by menopause, mostly due to genitourinary syndrome of menopause.
Nonetheless, women's knowledge about the diverse range of menopause symptoms and their therapies is still poor.
The importance of menopause hormone therapy for quality of life and prevention of chronic conditions, such as osteoporosis, is underestimated and its use remains generally low, likely due to women's view of menopause as a natural condition not requiring treatment, and common misconceptions and fears about side-effects (mostly cancer).
The lack of knowledge and training about menopause symptoms and treatment indications among healthcare professionals represents another important barrier to providing suitable personalized care to women.
The POESIT group highlights the need to raise public knowledge about menopause and its symptoms to improve care for women during and after menopausal transition.
Policymakers and scientific societies should be actively involved to address treatment barriers.
The POESIT group advocates the improvement of education among healthcare professionals to foster a personalized approach to menopause care.
