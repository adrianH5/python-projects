Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fourth most common cancer worldwide and is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally.
The development of GC is influenced by multiple factors.
This study aimed to detect the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and JC virus (JCV) in cancerous, non-malignant, and control tissue samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology.
In this descriptive cross-sectional study, we analyzed 150 paraffin-embedded tissue samples collected over a seven-month period from laboratory archives in East Azerbaijan province.
The samples comprised three groups: GC tissues (n = 50), non-malignant gastric tissues (n = 50), and control tissues (n = 50).
PCR was performed to detect EBV and JCV.
Then, Southern blot analysis was performed for EBV and JCV in PCR positive cases.
Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 18 software with chi-square testing.
Among the cancer samples (mean age 61.7 ± 12.01 years), PCR analysis detected EBV in 5 samples (10%) and JCV in 2 samples (4%).
The EBV-positive and JCV-positive cases had mean ages of 63.6 ± 13.31 and 61 ± 18.38 years, respectively.
No viral DNA was detected in either the non-malignant or control groups.
Southern blot analysis was positive in all PCR positive cases.
As cancer incidence continues to rise, understanding its risk factors becomes increasingly critical.
Our findings demonstrate the presence of EBV and JCV in GC tissues from this geographical region, suggesting their potential role in gastric carcinogenesis.
However, the relationship between oncoviruses and GC risk remains understudied.
Further research is warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these viruses may contribute to GC development.
