The current gold standard in scoliosis diagnostics remains the measurement of the curvature angle using X-ray imaging.
Several studies have already shown that children and adolescents with scoliosis suffer from health consequences due to cumulative radiation exposure from frequent radiological follow-ups.
Ultrasound diagnostics offers a radiation-free alternative for imaging scoliosis.
Various studies have already shown good reliability and validity of different ultrasound devices and various ultrasound methods for measuring the curvature angle in patients with scoliosis.
The aim of this study - investigating secondary hypotheses of our main study on "Assessment of the Efficacy of physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE) for Scoliosis through Ultrasound-Based Imaging Techniques" - was to compare two different ultrasound diagnostic methods for scoliosis with the gold standard, X-ray, and to assess their validity and reliability.
The curvature angle can be determined using ultrasound based on either the spinous processes (SP) or the transverse processes (TP).
The goal was to find out whether one of the two methods is more valid and should therefore be preferred in clinical practice.
