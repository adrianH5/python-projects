Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic cause of renal failure.
Uncontrolled proliferation drives ADPKD, which manifests with cystic kidney enlargement.
Yet, the mechanisms by which renal epithelial cells lose cell cycle control are largely unknown.
To investigate this, we examined the expression and function of the Ankyrin Repeat and single KH Domain 1 (ANKHD1), which positively regulates proliferation in cancer, yet its role in ADPKD is unexplored.
