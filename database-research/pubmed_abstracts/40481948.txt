Malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (MRTK) is a rare renal tumor with poor prognosis.
While germline mutations of SMARCB1 are considered to be the primary cause of MRTK, emerging evidence suggests that somatic epigenetic changes also play a vital role in the development and progression of MRTK.
YTHDF1, an m6A reader protein, has been implicated in regulation of tumorigenesis by influencing RNA translation and stability in several adult cancers.
However, the exploration of the role of YTHDF1 in pediatric cancer, especially MRTK, remains limited.
