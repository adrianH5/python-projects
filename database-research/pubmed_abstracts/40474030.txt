Survivors of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) for malignancies experience significant morbidity and mortality resulting from the long-term and late effects of transplant, necessitating life-long care.
The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of specialist BMT advanced practice nurses (APNs), physicians, and primary care practitioners regarding the challenges of delivering long-term care for survivors of BMT.
