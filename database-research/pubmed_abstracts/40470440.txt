High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the most common primary malignant brain neoplasms in adults, with a high rate of local relapse in the first two years after primary treatment, resulting in poor prognosis.
The aim of this study is to describe the potential benefits of the implementation of gyroscopic radiosurgery (GRS) in combination with modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) as a radiosensitizer for the reirradiation of large or multifocal recurrent HGGs.
