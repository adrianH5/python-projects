Membrane trafficking, including endocytosis and exocytosis, is a complex process that is coordinated by trafficking-associated proteins, cargo molecules, the cytoskeleton, and membrane lipid composition.
The NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 (human NEK8/9) and NEKL-3 (human NEK6/7) are conserved regulators of membrane trafficking in
