With a low autoimmune risk and dedicated induction of type â…  interferon production in immunotherapy, "STING therapy" holds broad prospects in the treatment of aggressive and metastatic cancers such as ovarian cancer (OC).
Inducing pyroptosis constitutes a promising approach for activating the anti-tumor immune response.
Nevertheless, compared to combination therapies, "single-molecule multitarget" drugs possess the merits of a lower interaction risk, more predictable pharmacokinetics and a lower cost of clinical trials.
Therefore, the present study was conducted to construct a structurally stable nanoparticles (TPAQu-Pt@HA NPs) with controlled drug release behavior and active targeting ability based on a self-designed and synthesized photo-platinum compound (TPAQu-Pt) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect without excipients.
The NPs attained "single-molecule multitarget" effect via three mechanisms: 1) causing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage and cytoplasmic leakage of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), effectively activating cGAS-STING pathway; 2) inducing pyroptosis benefited from the AIE effect conferring a stronger ROS-generating capacity; 3) photothermal therapy worsened mitochondrial dysfunction and intensified pyroptosis, amplifying activation of cGAS-STING pathway and the subsequent anti-tumor immune response.
In conclusion, this study provided a scientific basis for the molecular modification of cisplatin, which was expected to improve the treatment status of OC.
