Lung cancer is a significant health concern worldwide.
It is caused by smoking and exposure to carcinogens, although other factors like genetics, epigenetics, and transcription factors also play a role.
Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a transcription factor with a multifaceted role in regulating cellular functions in various cancers.
It has a vital role in lung cancer progression, but also has tumor-suppressing activity.
YY1 regulates epigenetic changes through DNA methylation, histone alteration, and non-coding RNAs.
In lung cancer, YY1 is overexpressed and involved in metastatic mechanisms, including epithelial and mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, migration, and angiogenesis.
These metastatic properties are influenced by various signaling pathways (PI3K-Akt-mTOR, RAF-MEK-ERK, JAK-STAT, and Wnt-Î²-catenin) through PD-L1 expression, autophagy, and drug insensitivity.
The current review recapitulates the recent advances on YY1 research in lung cancer progression and its influence on oncogenic pathways, immune regulation, and clinical significance.
Furthermore, this review also discusses using YY1 as a biomarker and targeted molecule in lung cancer.
