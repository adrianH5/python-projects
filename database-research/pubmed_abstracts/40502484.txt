For locally advanced gallbladder cancer, previous clinical studies have demonstrated that chemotherapy results in significant survival benefits when compared to surgery alone.

This study seeks to evaluate the impact chemotherapy has on survival in patients with early-stage gallbladder cancer using a large, multi-institution database.
