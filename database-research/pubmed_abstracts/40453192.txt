A recent meta-analysis published in this journal included 27 studies that experimentally manipulated social media use and investigated their impact on mental health outcomes (Ferguson, 2024).
The author concluded that social media effects were not statistically different from zero.
However, this meta-analysis did not investigate potential moderating effects of length of social media reduction or abstinence interventions.
We conducted a reanalysis to investigate the impact of social media reduction/abstinence intervention length on mental health outcomes.
We used the information available on the Open Science Framework platform related to the original meta-analysis and excluded seven studies because they were not reduction/abstinence interventions.
We categorized studies into those with intervention lengths of <1 versus 1 week or longer and also tested for curvilinear relationships between intervention length (weeks and days as continuous variables) and outcomes by including quadratic terms.
Stratified analyses indicated that interventions of <1 week resulted in significantly worse mental health outcomes (
