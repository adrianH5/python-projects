Herein, porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres were prepared to load icariin and miR-23b for the treatment of metastatic lung cancer.
The microspheres exhibited desirable aerodynamic diameter, high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency, as well as a favorable drug release profile, which was beneficial for the deposition and exposure of drugs in the lung tissues.
The release solution from microspheres exhibited a favorable anti-proliferative effect by inducting cell apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle at G1 phase, and meanwhile inhibited the migration and invasion of cancer cells.
More importantly, the microspheres could be effectively inhaled and accumulated in the lung tissues to trigger the
