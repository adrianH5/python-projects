Older adults with advanced cancer are at risk for toxicities and declines in physical function, which can impact their ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs, e.g., preparing meals, managing medications, and cleaning).
This decline is a key predictor of treatment outcomes and survival in this population.
To address this, we conducted a two-arm, randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based chair exercise intervention (ChairEx), delivered in-clinic by oncology staff.
