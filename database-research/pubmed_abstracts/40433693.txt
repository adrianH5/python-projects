The first clinical trial on eumycetoma was recently conducted in Sudan, comparing oral fosravuconazole, prodrug of active ravuconazole, with the standard-of-care oral itraconazole.
Building on this trial, the present study aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) of ravuconazole, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole in patients with eumycetoma and guide selection of either a 200 mg or 300 mg dose of fosravuconazole.
