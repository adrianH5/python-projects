Upregulation of the Kynurenine Pathway (KP) in Glioblastoma (GBM) plays an important role in driving its treatment-resistant immunosuppressive microenvironment.
Factors driving this exaggerated pathway remain poorly understood.
Our aim was to explore the correlation between key KP markers; IDO1, IDO2, TDO2, its primary effector target aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and a comprehensive set of clinical- and tumour characteristics.
