Holothurian glycosaminoglycan (hGAG) is an extract from the body wall of sea cucumber and previous studies have proved many unique bioactivities of it, such as anti-tumor, anti-coagulation and immune regulation.
Previous studies of our research group have shown hGAG promoted cell apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells by upregulating Bax and caspase-3 and downregulating Bcl-2, indicating mitochondrial apoptosis pathway participated in the process.
In the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, Bim induces cell apoptosis by either direct activation of pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak or neutralization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.
The transcription of Bim was regulated by FOXO3a.
Akt, one of the most important cellular signaling molecules, regulates apoptosis through its phosphorylation.
Phosphorylation of Akt results in translocation of FOXO3a from nuclear to cytoplasm.
This study aimed to explore the mechanism by which hGAG induced apoptosis in A549 cells, focusing on its regulation of the Akt/FOXO3a/Bim signaling pathway.
