Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has transformed bacterial strain typing, an essential tool for outbreak detection, antimicrobial resistance surveillance, and tracking clonal emergence across clinical, research, and public health settings.
Herein, we will review recent advances in WGS-based bacterial strain typing methods for purposes of comparison and classification with a focus on improvements in variant identification, strain classification, and transmission assessment.
