Blood cancers are one of the most common cancers worldwide.
These diseases stem from defects in blood components having cytogenetic aberrations and genetic mutations.
There have been vast improvements in terms of treatment options and survival outcomes.
Nevertheless, due to the clonal nature and heterogeneity of the diseases, the number of cases reported exhibit a rising pattern due to chemoresistance and disease relapse thus posing a healthcare burden.
Therefore, the need for more specific forms of targeted therapies is ever-present.
