Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can efficiently deliver nucleic acid therapeutics to a range of tissues, particularly hepatocytes to treat diseases of the liver.
We initially investigated whether three LNPs with different ionizable lipids, previously validated in non-human primates (NHPs), could deliver functional
