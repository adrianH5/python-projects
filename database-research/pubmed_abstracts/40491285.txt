In Europe, pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy is the recommended first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC), with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 1.
In France, the TPExtreme (TPEx) regimen is preferred for CPS < 1.
These regimens were studied in selected populations, which may not reflect real-world patients.
