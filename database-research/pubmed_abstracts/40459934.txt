Telomere biology disorders (TBDs) exhibit incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, even among individuals harboring the same pathogenic variant.
We assessed whether common genetic variants associated with telomere length combine with large-effect variants to impact penetrance and expressivity in TBDs.
