Curcumin, a natural bioactive compound, is known to exert therapeutic effects on cancer and dysplasia.
However, less is known of its effects on DNA damage and repair in obesity.
Therefore, this study was to examine the novel role of curcumin in regulating DNA repair signaling using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice.
Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a 60% of HFD or standard chow with curcumin (2.5g/kg diet) for eight weeks.
We observed that curcumin alleviated weight gain, preserved glucose balance, and enhanced liver fat accumulation and lipid profile in mice with obesity induced by a HFD.
Curcumin enhanced the adipocyte-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) population (Sca-1+CD45-) and expression of phosphorylated checkpoint kinase1 (pCHK1), a DNA repair gene, in adipocytes isolated from adipose tissues of HFD-induced obesity in mice.
Moreover, in human preadipocytes, treatment with 10 Î¼M curcumin effectively reduced the mRNA levels of
