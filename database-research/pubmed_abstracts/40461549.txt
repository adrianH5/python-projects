Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly malignant bone tumor that primarily affects children, adolescents, and young adults.
Despite significant progress in chemotherapy, surgery, and limb salvage surgery, the prognosis for patients with high-grade or metastatic OS remains poor.
This study explores the role of SAC3D1 gene in OS and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.
Through analysis of public databases and experimental verification, we found that SAC3D1 is significantly upregulated in OS tissues and cell lines and is associated with poor prognosis in patients.
Functional enrichment analysis suggests that SAC3D1 may promote the progression of OS by regulating cell cycle, DNA repair, and immune microenvironment pathways.
In addition, the expression level of SAC3D1 is associated with the tumor immune microenvironment and immune therapy response.
In vitro experiments further confirmed that knocking down SAC3D1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of OS cells, while its overexpression enhanced these malignant biological behaviors.
In summary, SAC3D1 has important prognostic and therapeutic potential in OS, and may serve as a novel independent prognostic marker and therapeutic target for OS.
