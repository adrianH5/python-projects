Chemotherapy induced constipation (CIC) is a gastrointestinal side effect that occurs in patients receiving chemotherapy, which can further deteriorate the living quality of cancer patients.
Deglycosylated azithromycin (Deg-AZM), a newly developed Class I drug with good therapeutic effects on chronic constipation, has been approved for clinical trials in 2024.
However, it is unclear whether Deg-AZM has any impact on gut microbiota of CIC mice.
The purpose of this study was to explore the role of Deg-AZM in treating CIC by modulating the gut microbiota.
