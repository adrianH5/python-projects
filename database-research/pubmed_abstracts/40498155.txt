Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) has emerged as a promising radiopharmaceutical modality in precision oncology.
Compared to beta-emitters, alpha-emitters exhibit superior properties, including higher linear energy transfer, shorter penetration range, enhanced resistance to hypoxic conditions, and convenient radiation protection.
Notably, alpha-emitters also demonstrate therapeutic efficacy against a subset of tumors exhibiting resistance to beta-radiotherapy.
In 2013, the first α-particle therapeutic agent, ²²³RaCl₂ (Xofigo
