The chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model is gaining increasing attention from cancer researchers worldwide.
Its affordability, short experimental duration, robustness, and ease of tumor xenograft visualization make it a valuable tool in cancer research.
This review explores recent advancements and potential applications of the avian CAM model, including the following: (1) studying tumor growth and metastasis, (2) investigating mechanisms of tumor chemoresistance, (3) optimizing drug delivery methods, (4) improving bioimaging techniques, (5) evaluating immuno-oncology drug efficacy, (6) examining tumor-extracellular matrix interactions, (7) analyzing tumor angiogenesis, and (8) exploring the roles of microRNAs in cancer.
Additionally, we compare the
