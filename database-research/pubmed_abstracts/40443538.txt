Immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy, cancer vaccines, and other modalities, represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment.
Breast cancer, traditionally considered less amenable to immunotherapy, has demonstrated responsiveness to immunotherapy when combined with conventional treatment options.
These integrative strategies enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy, bringing hope to patients.
Furthermore, precision therapies guided by predictive biomarkers refine the scope of breast cancer immunotherapy and broaden its advantages.
Notably, it is essential to recognise the differences in breast cancer epidemiology, clinical outcomes, and molecular signatures between Asian populations and those in Europe and North America.
These include a higher proportion of premenopausal patients and variation in subtype distribution and gene mutation profiles, underscoring the importance of considering racial specificity in immunotherapy.
Clinical efforts in Asia, supported by ethnicity-specific studies, indigenous immunotherapeutic agents, and precision medicine informed by predictive biomarkers, provide tailored treatment options.
This review aims to present an overview of breast cancer immunotherapy while address the racial specificity to inform its application for Asian patients.
