Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent a crucial component of tumor stroma and play critical roles in cancer progression.
However, the role of CAFs derived exosomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) environment is unexplored.
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) serve as epigenetic effectors in cancer progression and constitute significant compositions of exosomes.
Here, we explored the functional mechanism of exosomal piRNAs in OSCC development.
