Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most commonly used initial modality for most lung diseases, including pulmonary nodules.
In diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and fungal infections, detecting a single nodule in the early stages will facilitate treatment.
One of the most important obstacles to searching for a single pulmonary nodule on a CXR is peripheral background contrast enhancement, and density differences.
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of inverted gray scale to the standard image of CXR in the detection of a single pulmonary nodule.
