An abnormal immune response at the fetal-maternal interface is expected in 50-60Â % of unexplained Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (uRPL) cases.
Detected immunophenotypes in uRPL could help in risk assessment, prognosis and therapy.
The study of immune mechanisms at the fetal-maternal interface is crucial, but the technique used for research has limitations, including contamination and invasiveness, which can trigger immune responses.
Hystero-embryoscopy may provide a precise method for studying the immunological factors involved in RPL at the maternal-fetal interface, reducing bias from sample collection techniques.
Our aim is to assess its effectiveness in obtaining high-quality samples to study the immunological basis of RPL.
