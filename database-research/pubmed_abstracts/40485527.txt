Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal forms of gynecological malignancies.
Previous studies indicate that S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway has been implicated in the development and progression of a variety of cancers, but its effects and mechanisms in OC cells remain unclear.
This study aims to explore the effect of S100A8 on autophagy and apoptosis in OC cells and the regulatory effects of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
