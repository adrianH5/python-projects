In patients with oligometastatic disease (OMD), local therapy to metastatic sites has gained acceptance despite uncertainty regarding its long-term benefits or whether some subgroups would benefit more than others.
Here, we report a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding stereotactic radiation to metastases versus the standard of care (SOC) in treating OMD.
