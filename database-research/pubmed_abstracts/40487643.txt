Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) can potentially induce immunogenic cell death in tumor cells, leading to the release of ATP, and facilitating the initiation of an immune response.
Nevertheless, the enzymes CD39 and CD73 can swiftly convert ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine (ADO), resulting in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).
This study introduced a nanomedicine (QD/POM1@NP@M) engineered to reprogram TME by modulating the CD39/CD73/ADO pathway.
The nanomedicine encapsulated sonosensitizers silver sulfide quantum dots, and the CD39 inhibitor POM1, while also incorporating homologous tumor cell membranes to enhance targeting capabilities.
This integrated approach, on the one hand, stimulates the release of ATP
