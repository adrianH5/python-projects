Cell plasticity is a hallmark of cancer, enabling tumor cells to acquire multiple phenotypes responsible for tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance.
In this issue of the JCI, Kawai and colleagues leveraged genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to demonstrate that loss of Pbrm1, a member of the SWI/SNF complex, drives dedifferentiation and aggressive tumor features.
Pbrm1 loss activated a program of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and allowed the emergence of poorly differentiated histologies that are commonly associated with high recurrence rate and dismal prognosis.
These findings reveal the role of the SWI/SNF complex during PDAC evolution in maintaining cell identity and restraining the progression of this lethal disease.
