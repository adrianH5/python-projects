In a recent publication (Reprod.
Biomed.
Online, 2024) it was presented point of view that, for post-cancer patients, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is a more effective method than ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC).
In their commentary, Andersen et al.
(Reprod.
Biomed.
Online, 2024) present nine distinct arguments advocating for the use of OTC.
We fully agree with all these points.
In support of the clinical application of the OTC procedure, we introduce two additional arguments.
First, the transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue can be considered as a form of tissue therapy.
Moreover, OTC inherently serves as an activator of oogenesis.
Second, during tissue dissection prior to OTC, a significant number of germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes can be retrieved, matured to the metaphase II (MII) stage, cryopreserved, and later used in IVF procedures.
