An international consensus was established in 2018 to standardise practice using geometric (5 + 5 mm) expansion around GTV-P for definitive radiotherapy of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNC).
The GORTEC (French HNC Oncology and Radiotherapy Group) conducted a survey to assess the level of agreement about CTV-P2 delineation using a "formalised consensus method".
