Maintaining compliance with oral nutritional supplements (ONS) is a major problem in patients receiving nutritional support after surgical treatment for gastric cancer.
The objective of this multicenter, single-arm phase II study was to test whether nutritional support with energy-dense ONS (1.6 kcal/mL) provides an average caloric intake of 200 kcal/day or more for a greater proportion of patients than that reported in previous studies.
