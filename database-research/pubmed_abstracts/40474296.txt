Angiosarcoma, a rare and highly aggressive malignancy originating from vascular endothelial cells, is characterized by its rapid progression, high invasiveness, and poor prognosis.
Due to the limited understanding of its tumor microenvironment (TME) and the absence of effective treatments, further research is essential to elucidate its pathogenic mechanisms and improve therapeutic strategies.
