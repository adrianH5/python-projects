Meningioma (MEN) is one of the most common intracranial tumors, with a significantly higher incidence rate in females than in males.
Although the majority of cases are benign, tumors located in complex anatomical regions or classified as atypical or malignant have a high recurrence rate, underscoring the need to optimize therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.
Therefore, this study utilizes single-cell RNA-sequencing technology to investigate the interaction mechanisms between endothelial cells (ECs) and meningiomas, aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of MEN patients.
