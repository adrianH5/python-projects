Bladder cancer (BCa) is a prevalent malignant tumor in the urinary system.
Molecular subtyping, utilizing molecular characteristics, represents a novel classification system that has demonstrated its efficacy in tumor diagnosis and treatment.
Given the critical role of molecular subtyping in the BCa treatment, acquiring a comprehensive understanding is imperative for guiding treatment decisions, optimizing risk assessment systems, and ultimately improving patient prognosis.
