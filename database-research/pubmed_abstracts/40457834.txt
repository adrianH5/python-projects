Though NK cells often infiltrate the breast tumor microenvironment, they are frequently described as dysfunctional in this setting, and mechanisms limiting their antitumor cytotoxic potential are unclear.
In this issue, Ben-Shmuel and colleagues show that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts interact with NK cells via established ligand-receptor pairs and in turn suppress NK-cell cytolytic potential against cancer cells by acting as decoys.
