Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, but it is exceedingly rare for both partners in a married couple to be diagnosed with RCC within a short time frame.
This case report describes a married couple who were diagnosed with RCC in close succession, exploring potential risk factors and highlighting the unmet survivorship needs of couples affected by cancer.
Both partners shared risk factors, including a history of smoking and hypertension.
The case focuses on the role of shared environmental exposures, specifically the wife's occupation as a house cleaner and the husband's role as a floor installer, in potentially contributing to carcinogenic risks in occupational settings.
However, no hereditary RCC syndromes were identified.
This report emphasizes the need for integrated care models that address the unique challenges faced by couples with concurrent cancer diagnoses, ensuring comprehensive support for both patients and their caregivers.
