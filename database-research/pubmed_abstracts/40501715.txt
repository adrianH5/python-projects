Necrosis, conventionally thought of as a passive consequence of aggressive tumor growth, is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC).
We recently discovered that necrosis can be caused by neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) aggregates driving vascular occlusion within the tumor vasculature in models of breast cancer.
Here, we evaluated the role of NETs in inducing necrosis and metastasis in CRC.
We found that the numbers of neutrophils primed to form NETs were elevated in the circulation of patients with CRC as compared to controls.
