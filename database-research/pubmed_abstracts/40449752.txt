Gastrointestinal toxicity, primarily manifesting as colitis, is one of the most common adverse events during irinotecan (CPT-11) treatment for colon cancer, significantly impacting therapeutic efficacy and the general condition of patients.
Tectorigenin (TEC) is a flavonoid compound extracted from Bupleurum and saponins, which are traditional Chinese medicines with anti-inflammatory properties.
Previous experiments have found that it can alleviate CPT-11-induced diarrhoea and synergistically inhibit tumor growth with CPT-11, but the specific mechanisms remain unknown.
