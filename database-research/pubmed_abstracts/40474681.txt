Robotic navigational bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound have augmented diagnostic yield and localization of challenging pulmonary nodules.
However, there is a paucity of literature regarding its role in decision-making during single-anesthesia bronchoscopy and resection (SABAR).
We aim to describe our experience of SABAR via shape-sensing robotic navigational bronchoscopy (SSRNB).
