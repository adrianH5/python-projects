Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed in women globally and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among younger women diagnosed between the ages of 20-49 years in the United States (US).
Although the median age of BC diagnosis is 62 years overall, recent data show that early-onset BC is on the rise in young people.
Black and Hispanic women are disproportionately affected by BC, often diagnosed at a younger age, and BC is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both groups of women.
The aim of this report is to present the unique case of a young adult Hispanic woman diagnosed with early-stage BC.
Younger women with BC face unique biological and psychosocial challenges compared to older post-menopausal women.
Additionally, young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) are at an increased risk of BC recurrence.
Therefore, there is a critical need to develop interventions that are tailored to the cultural and age-specific needs of racial and ethnic minority women to promote cancer risk-reduction and to improve health outcomes.
