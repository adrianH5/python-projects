In cases of impaired fertility, the quality of oocytes and their subsequent embryonic development following fertilization are critical concerns in clinical practice.
Core fucosylation, catalyzed by fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8), is a common N-glycosylation modification that plays a key role in cell proliferation and signal transduction.
This study examines the role of core fucosylation in follicular regulation during oocyte development.
