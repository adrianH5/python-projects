Function-preserving gastrectomy has been gradually implemented in China.
Under the premise of oncologic safety,such surgery is crucial for improving patients' postoperative quality of life.
Although proximal gastrectomy is a classic surgical method for the adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction,no consensus exists on the vagus nerve preservation and digestive tract reconstruction.
How to preserve the vagus nerve and pyloric function, and avoid postoperative gastroesophageal reflux after proximal gastrectomy has consistently been the focus of clinical research on proximal gastrectomy.
This study introduces the application of laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with nerve vagus preservation combined with double-flap anastomosis in proximal early gastric cancer.
The hepatic branches and the celiac branches are both preserved during the surgical procedure,and the manufacture of double-flap is completed through auxiliary incisions.
The anastomosis of the esophagus and the remnant stomach is performed under laparoscopy.
It conforms to the physiological structure and preserved the functions of the stomach,which avoided weight loss and nutritional absorption disorder after total gastrectomy.
Additionally, it reduces the incidence of reflux esophagitis following traditional esophagogastrostomy, thereby improving patients' postoperative quality of life.
