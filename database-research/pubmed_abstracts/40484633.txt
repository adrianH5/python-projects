Healthcare courses typically approach Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) education from a 'translational science' perspective.
Students are taught about 'evidence-based' interventions, which are developed through scientific research (hence, assumed to be politically neutral), implemented with 'fidelity' (ie, in a standardised way in diverse contexts) and then 'rolled out'.
Progress is measured using standardised indicators.
We argue for a shift to 'translational humanities', in which students are supported to engage critically with the cultural and political dynamics and epistemic uncertainties underpinning the setting of SDG targets, the development and implementation of programmes, and the measurement of success.
Translational humanities seeks to surface alternative framings and measures of success, especially by giving voice to marginalised and ignored communities.
This radical approach, informed by political philosophy, recognises that conflict among stakeholders and the uncertainty it generates are inevitable and can be a productive force (eg, if surfaced and used to inform multifaceted debate and values-driven action).Whereas a translational science approach to SDG education emphasises objectivity, technical precision and (the pursuit of) certainty, a translational humanities approach seeks to foster human and interpretive qualities such as reflection, critical thinking, commitment to human rights and fairness, appreciation of complexity, epistemic humility and flexibility, willingness to examine problems from multiple angles, the capacity to adapt, and tolerance of uncertainty.
In a worked example of how this can be achieved, we introduce the 'critical datathon'-a group exercise in which students engage deeply with case studies of SDGs, examine the assumptions and interests behind conventional solutions, and navigate diverse implementation contexts.
