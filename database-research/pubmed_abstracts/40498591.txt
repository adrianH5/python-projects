A series of aminated quinolinequinones linked to piperazine analogs (QQ1-7) were synthesized and screened against the full panel of National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer cell lines for their potential as cytotoxic agents.
The Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI analyzed the NCI-60 screening results and revealed that seven QQs were potent inhibitors of cancer cell growth across several cell lines, advancing them to the five-dose assay.
Encouraged by the NCI five-dose assay results, the cytotoxicity of the selected QQs (QQ1 and QQ4) was further studied in three cancer cell lines-HCT-116 (colon cancer), ACHN (renal cancer), MCF7, and T-47D (breast cancer)-as well as in a normal cell line (HUVEC) for a deeper understanding.
QQ1 was the hit compound for ACHN cells with an IC
