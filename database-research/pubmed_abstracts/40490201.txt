E26 Transformation-Specific homolog 2 (ETS2) is a founding member of the ETS family of transcription factors and has been implicated in several developmental and survival functions.
The predominant route of its action is by directly binding and regulating the promoters of its target genes, although it can function through other regulatory mechanisms as well.
In this review, a comprehensive understanding of the contribution of ETS2 in health and disease is described with specific focus on cancer.
ETS2 demonstrates extreme complexity as it can act as a double-edged sword in cancer with tumour suppressive or oncogenic functions in a context specific manner.
Here, we delineate the different signalling pathways, post-translational modifications, miRNA regulations and protein-protein interactions that illustrate the role of ETS2 as an emerging biomarker with special emphasis on its contribution to 'hallmarks of cancer'.
Given the evidently opposing effects of ETS2 in different cancers, elucidating the critical mechanisms in its development and progression can validate ETS2's potential as a novel therapeutic target.
Finally, we provide insights into frontier areas of research focus that implicate ETS2 and can translate into clinical outcomes.
