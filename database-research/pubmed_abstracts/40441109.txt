Herein, we achieved ultrasensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of bladder cancer (BC) urine biomarkers, nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) by preparing gold and silver core-shell triangular nanonets (AgAu@Ag TNNs) with porous triangular mesh structures.
The tip effect of the triangular structure of AgAu@Ag TNNs and the plasma coupling of the mesh holes on its surface enabled an enhancement factor (EF) of 1.37 × 10
