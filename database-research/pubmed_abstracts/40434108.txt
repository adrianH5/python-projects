Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a growing but often unrecognized medical problem for people with diabetes (particularly type 2 diabetes, especially when associated with obesity).
Liver health has not been at the forefront of complications tracked for disease prevention, as traditionally done for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy.
However, liver steatosis affects approximately two out of three people with type 2 diabetes and places them at an increased risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and overall liver-related mortality.
MASLD is also associated with extrahepatic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and negatively impacts health-related quality of life.
However, most individuals and their health care professionals remain unaware of the severe hepatic or extrahepatic health risks associated with MASLD and the need for early identification.
In recognition of this knowledge gap and the rising prevalence of MASLD, this consensus report is a call to action to screen for liver fibrosis and risk stratify people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, in particular if obesity is also present.
This consensus report explains the rationale for the recent MASLD nomenclature change, how to best risk stratify, current treatment and long-term monitoring options, the value of an interprofessional approach to disease management, and the impact of alcohol intake on liver health.
More awareness about the health risks associated with MASLD and broad adoption of screening for liver fibrosis as a new standard of care hold promise for a future without cirrhosis for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.
