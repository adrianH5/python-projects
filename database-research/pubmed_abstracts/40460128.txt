Historically, endocrine cells were perceived to coordinate their output in a uniform manner.
Recently however, single-cell technologies have uncovered heterogeneity within these populations, indicating that individual cells may operate as independently regulated units.
Using high-resolution tools such as single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (sm-FISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we investigated the contributions of individual and the collective of fetal Leydig cells to androgen production over time during mouse testis development.
Temporal profiles of intratesticular androgens alongside the expression of steroidogenic pathway genes (
