Nuclear protein in testis (NUT) carcinoma is a rare disease characterized by aggressive and rapid progression.
There is no standard management of primary pulmonary NUT carcinoma until now, and the median overall survival is only 4.4 months.
Here, we describe a case where a 48-year-old woman presented with a dry, lasting half a month, and she was diagnosed with primary pulmonary NUT carcinoma and was given chemotherapy, immunotherapy, antiangiogenesis therapy, and palliative radiotherapy.
When secondary tumor progression, she was conducted an organoid drug sensitivity test for better guide therapy.
The initial two cycles of first-line and second-line treatments in our patient proved effective and improved the overall survival to more than 8 months.
This is the first report of the use of an organoid drug sensitivity test for primary pulmonary NUT carcinoma.
It provides a new approach for selecting drugs, particularly when multiple lines of treatment have proven ineffective and the next steps are unclear.
