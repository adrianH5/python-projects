Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure that is widely used for the treatment of early gastric cancer and certain submucosal tumors.
ESD often results in large artificial ulcers, leading to a risk of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, which is a significant complication.
Traditional methods to address this bleeding include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), local hemostatic sprays, hemostatic clips, electrocoagulation, etc.
However, this research introduces polysaccharide-based materials as a novel hemostatic solution, demonstrating their effectiveness in preventing upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding associated with ESD.
The results of our study, focusing on both gastric and esophageal lesions, suggest that the microporous polysaccharide hemostatic material is effective in preventing bleeding following upper gastrointestinal tract ESD procedures.
The key benefits of polysaccharide hemostatic materials include biocompatibility, no immune risk, excellent absorbability, and fast hemostatic speed.
Clinical results from the study indicate that patients treated with these materials did not experience delayed bleeding, and follow-up gastroscopy showed good wound healing without negative impacts on the artificial ulcer.
This suggests that polysaccharide hemostatic materials are a safe and effective option for patients undergoing gastric ESD surgery.
