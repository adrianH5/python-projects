Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal malignant brain tumor, with limited treatment options and poor patient prognosis.
Novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to extend survival and improve quality of life for GBM patients.
Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that GBM cells exhibit substantial upregulation of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, identifying DDR as a promising therapeutic target.
To leverage this vulnerability, we investigated pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH
