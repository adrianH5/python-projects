Rezvilutamide, an androgen-receptor inhibitor, has been approved by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration as a first-line treatment for high-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).
This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of rezvilutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to bicalutamide plus ADT for the first-line treatment of high-volume mHSPC in China.
