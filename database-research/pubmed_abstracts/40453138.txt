Treatment sequencing and survival outcomes in follicular lymphoma (FL) are heterogeneous.
This study describes real-world treatment patterns and outcomes among older patients with FL in the United States.
Patients aged ≥65 years diagnosed with FL were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare (2000-2017) and followed up through 2019.
