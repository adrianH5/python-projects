Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm known to occur in various soft tissue and visceral locations.
Solitary fibrous tumor arising from the seminal vesicles is rare and reported in only 12 earlier patients.
Herein, we describe a SFT arising from the left seminal vesicle in a 58-year-old male patient who underwent a robotic left seminal vesiculectomy.
Histologically, the tumor resembled a mixed epithelial and stromal tumor due to secondary non-neoplastic proliferation of the benign seminal vesicle tissue admixed with SFT.
The spindle cells of SFT had CD34+/STAT6+ immunophenotype, whereas the admixed benign seminal vesicle tissue was negative for both CD34 and STAT6 immunohistochemical stains.
Next-generation sequencing confirmed the presence of
