Nigeria has a significant cancer burden, especially breast cancer (BC), which has the highest incidence and mortality in the country.
However, like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the focus continues to be on infectious diseases to the detriment of addressing non-communicable diseases like cancer with a resultant paucity in available funding, health infrastructure and even health workforce geared towards cancer care.
All these invariably lead to very low access to cancer care, with poor patient outcomes being recorded.
The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of BC survivors who are part of a non-profit cancer advocacy group to highlight important areas of cancer survivorship that can be targeted by cancer advocacy programs and interventions in Nigeria.
