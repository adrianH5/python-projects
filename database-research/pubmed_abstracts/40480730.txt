Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline anticancer drug that is commonly employed in the treatment of acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer.
Given the narrow safe dosage range and the strong toxic reaction associated with the drug, prolonged or excessive use can result in serious adverse reactions, which greatly limits its clinical application.
It is therefore necessary to develop a rapid, sensitive and reproducible therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) method for DOX in order to create an individualised dosing regimen based on the patient's specific situation, thus facilitating the precise treatment of the disease.
