We developed Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting mucin 1 (MUC1)* (muk * (muk 1 star)), which is the tumor-associated growth factor receptor form of MUC1.
Our antibody, MNC2, uniquely binds to MUC1* on cancer cells but does not bind to full-length MUC1, which is expressed on all normal epithelial cells.
We tested the ability of the Tyr to Phe mutations in CD3Î¶, known as "1XX", to increase in vivo persistence and enable the recognition and killing of low antigen-expressing cancer cells.
