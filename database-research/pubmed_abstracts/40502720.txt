Risk-stratification at diagnosis of prostate cancer does not always predict risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR).
Fully utilizing post-radiotherapy follow-up Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) data could offer earlier and higher prognostic value than pre-treatment risk-stratification.We investigate whether PSA dynamics in the first three-years of follow-up can re-stratify risk of treatment failure after radical radiotherapy, allowing for targeted intervention.
