Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, yet it continues to have a low survival rate, largely due to the lack of effective treatments.
Metabolomics offers new insight into disease diagnosis and biomarkers discovery.
The aim of the study is to identify serum biomarkers in a CRC xenograft mouse model treated with topotecan using advanced metabolomics techniques to enhance our understanding and management of the disease.
