Understanding the heterogeneity of tumor vascular function and oxygenation is key in individualizing treatments, especially with therapies that are ineffective in hypoxic microenvironments.
Our previous work has demonstrated that ultrasound-guided photoacoustic imaging (US-PAI)-based blood oxygen saturation (StO
