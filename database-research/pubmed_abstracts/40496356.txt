Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a procedure used for patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).
However, the procedure has been reported to be associated with high morbidity and mortality.
Laparoscopic ALPPS has recently been reported as a minimally invasive technique that reduces perioperative risks.
