Anastomotic leak and subsequent organ/space surgical site infection (O/S-SSI) after colorectal cancer surgery are associated with poor short-term outcomes; however, the evidence regarding long-term outcomes is inconclusive.
This population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between O/S-SSI and both tumour recurrence and long-term survival after curative rectal cancer surgery.
