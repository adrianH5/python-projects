Bioprospecting of indigenous plants for biological/cytotoxic properties has become an area of growing interest in cancer research.
Wrightia tinctoria is a lesser-studied plant widely distributed in India which is commonly used in traditional medicinal systems like Ayurveda and Siddha and holds potential as a source for novel therapeutic agents.
In this study, the cytotoxic effects of Wrightia tinctoria bark extracts on oral cancer (KB) cell lines were evaluated, focusing on three different extraction solvents ethanol, ethyl acetate, and water.
The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the cytotoxic effects of Wrightia tinctoria bark extracts, while also investigating their potential to induce apoptosis which can contribute into exploration of new plant based anticancer agents.
