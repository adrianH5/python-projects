Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often experience skeletal muscle mass (SMM) reduction, increasing chemotherapy toxicity risk.
Although CT and MRI scans are commonly used to assess SMM, their limitations exist.
Ultrasound, a convenient alternative, may serve as a predictive tool for chemotherapy toxicity.
