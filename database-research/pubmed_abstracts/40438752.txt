Cancer patients experience a wide range of unmet supportive care needs, which may lead to dissatisfaction with the health care system and poor quality of life.
The aims of this study were to assess unmet supportive care needs in five areas: informative needs, psycho-emotional needs, relational needs, material needs and needs related to assistance/care, and to identify groups of cancer patients expressing high rates of unmet needs.
