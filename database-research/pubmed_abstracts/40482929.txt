MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding and internally derived small RNA molecules.
They post-transcriptionally direct gene expression either by inhibiting translation or initiating degradation of mRNA.
Conserved evolutionarily, these miRNAs have a significant role in several developmental and regulatory functions in organisms including mammalian cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
An individual miRNA can modulate a network of mRNA expression by binding to multiple mRNAs through imperfect sequence complementarity.
In several types of cancer, dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to cell initiation, migration, incursion, proliferation, immortality, and drug resistance.
Among all leukemia cases, approximately 15â€¯% of patients suffer from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
miRNA-based modulation offers the idiosyncratic competence for regulating a variety of genes simultaneously; in that way, it could help to modulate accordant signalling pathways that are engaged in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.
The one-drug, one-target approach thereby evolves into a paradigm of one drug with multiple targets.
This review will delve into the understanding of miRNA dysregulation and recent advancements in therapeutic strategies based on miRNAs.
