Early detection of locally recurring prostate cancer (PCa) after definitive radiation therapy (RT) offers the opportunity to deliver targeted salvage therapies, thereby reducing the risk of disease progression.
Quantitative MRI (qMRI) parameters show promise as imaging biomarkers for early detection of local recurrence.
However, the feasibility of using qMRI for response monitoring in patients undergoing RT combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains uncertain.
Here, we identified the qMRI parameters with potential to reliably detect post-RT response in PCa and compared the response in patients receiving RT combined with ADT versus those receiving RT alone.
