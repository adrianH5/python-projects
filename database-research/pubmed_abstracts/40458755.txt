Non-invasive assessment of iron deposition is the standard of care for guiding chelation therapy in patients with iron overload.
Several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques have been developed.
This study compares the MRI-based R2* method with the standard R2-based method for quantifying iron levels in the liver and heart in children and young adults with secondary iron overload.
