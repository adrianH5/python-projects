In recent years, the incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) has been increasing year by year.
Due to its characteristics of high recurrence and high invasion, CSCC poses a great potential threat to the prognosis of patients.
Aromatic turmerone, an active component of Curcuma longa, has been shown to have anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation effects in modern pharmacological research, but its influence on CSCC remains unclear.
In this study, we used AT to intervene in human CSCC A431 cell line.
The results showed that the growth ability of A431 was significantly inhibited by the intervention of AT.
Also, we found that compared to normal A431, the cell invasion number and migration rate of A431 were reduced to (116.00±8.00) and (39.87±4.20) %, respectively, after the intervention of AT.
And detecting the inflammatory response in the cells, we found that AT reduced the inflammatory factors and oxidative stress in A431.
Meanwhile, aromatic turmerone suppressed the autophagy of A431 and silenced the IGF-1/PI3K/AKT pathway expression, which further reveals the mechanism and pathway of action of aromatic turmerone on CSCC, laying a reliable foundation for the clinical application of aromatic turmerone.
