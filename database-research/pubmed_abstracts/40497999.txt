Resistance to cell death is one of the core hallmarks of cancer, with regulatory abnormalities particularly pronounced in the malignant progression and therapeutic resistance of melanoma.
This review aims to systematically summarize the roles and mechanisms of regulated cell death (RCD) in melanoma.
Currently, distinct types of RCD, including apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, immunogenic cell death, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, have all been found to be involved in melanoma.
Autophagy promotes the survival of melanoma cells under stress conditions through metabolic adaptation, yet its excessive activation can trigger cell death.
Immunogenic cell death has the capacity to elicit adaptive immune responses in immunocompetent syngeneic hosts.
Necroptosis, governed by the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)/RIPK3 mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) signaling axis, can synergize with immunotherapy to enhance anti-melanoma immune responses when activated.
Pyroptosis, mediated by Gasdermin proteins, induces the release of inflammatory factors that reshape the tumor microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Ferroptosis, characterized by lipid peroxidation, can overcome melanoma resistance by targeting the solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis.
Therapeutic strategies targeting RCD pathways have demonstrated breakthrough potential.
Several agents have been developed to target RCD in order to suppress melanoma.
