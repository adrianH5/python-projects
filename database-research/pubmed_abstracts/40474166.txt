The impact of robotic gastrectomy (RG) surgery on advanced gastric cancer following neoadjuvant therapy remains a topic of debate.
A thorough search and analysis of the current relevant evidence is needed.
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and advantages of RG for gastric cancer after neoadjuvant therapy, comparing it with traditional laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) surgery.
