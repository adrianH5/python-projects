To prevent recurrence after inguinal hernia surgery, placing a large mesh that ensures adequate overlap of the hernial orifice is crucial.
However, using totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach, the arcuate line can obstruct the creation of sufficient space for large meshes, making the application challenging.
To solve this problem, we introduced a caudal view technique (CVT), inserting a 5-mm scope from a cordal port, to assist in making sufficient space for mesh placement, and dissecting the arcuate line as needed.
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the CVT method in facilitating appropriate large mesh placement.
