Nanofibers have been investigated for the possible topical delivery of medicines, one of the nanostructure-based drug delivery strategies produced by nanotechnology.
Filaments or thread-like structures in the nanometer size range are called nanofibers, and they are made from a variety of polymers, including synthetic and natural polymers, or a combination of both.
The polymers, preparation methods, and design specifications all affect the nanofibers' diameter or size.
When creating nanofibers, the four main processing methods phase separation, self-assembly, template synthesis, and electrospinning are most frequently employed.
The morphology and characterization parameters of nanofibers require a multimethod approach due to their unique structure.
Large-scale manufacturing of nanofibers with the required qualities is still problematic, though, because popular electrospinning techniques have drawbacks like low yield, high voltage requirements, and trouble accomplishing
