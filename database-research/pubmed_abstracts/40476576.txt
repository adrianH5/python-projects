Peroxiredoxin (PRDX) is a large and highly conserved family of peroxidases, which can maintain the dynamic balance of intracellular oxidative stress levels based on the degradation of the hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite and lipid peroxides, among others.
Additionally, PRDXs are expressed with varying levels in almost all tumor tissues and cells, and they can regulate the downstream signaling cascades by modulating intracellular peroxide levels in tumor cells, alongside the participation during the modulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, differentiation and other cellular biological behaviors.
It has been revealed that the PRDXs family exhibits crucial functions in the occurrence, development, diagnosis and prognosis of gastrointestinal cancer, but a systematic summary was lacking in relevant studies.
Therefore, the present study aims at probing into the underlying mechanisms of the PRDXs family in the occurrence and development of gastrointestinal cancer, providing new insights into the clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis monitoring.
