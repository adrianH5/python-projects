Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has evolved significantly over the past few decades.
Up-front treatment options expanded from doublet regimens to triplets and now to quadruplets.
Monoclonal antibodies have significantly contributed to this paradigm shift.
Their incorporation into frontline regimens demonstrated improved survival outcomes irrespective of transplantation eligibility.
Autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (ASCT) remains standard in frontline consolidation therapy with recent expansion of eligibility, including older adults and patients with renal failure.
The growing understanding of physiologic age and frailty, as well as improvements in supportive care, has made this possible.
Bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibodies are heralding a new age of treatment of MM with high response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
With the impressive responses seen, these treatments are being studied in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with other therapies.
With this rapidly evolving field of immunotherapy in MM, the goal of this review was to discuss the latest advances in MM treatment, focusing on up-front quadruplet therapy, the role of ASCT in the modern era, and the evolving role of BiTEs in up-front therapy.
