Care navigation is a type of care co-ordination used to manage people with chronic conditions with the goal of reducing unplanned hospital presentations and improving patient care and outcomes.
Care navigation involves individual case management by a trained professional who is not involved in the person's direct care.
Care navigation has been used in various healthcare settings, adopted as a single or multi-component intervention by different health services.
However, little is known about its effect on unplanned hospital presentations and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
