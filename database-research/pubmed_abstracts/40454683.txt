Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability globally, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, including women and infants.
Despite significant preventability, Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be underfunded and overshadowed by cancer in terms of policy attention, creating a significant health inequity.
This article advocates for a shift in international health policy to prioritize CVD through targeted, disease-specific interventions and multilevel strategies addressing both modifiable and primordial risk factors.
It highlights the crucial role of nurses and healthcare professionals in influencing CVD prevention and treatment, from individual behavior changes to policy advocacy.
The article concludes that collaboration across sectors, including healthcare, policymakers, and communities, is essential to implement effective CVD strategies and reduce global mortality and morbidity.
Clinically, nurses are positioned to lead in patient education, support community-based initiatives, and advocate for stronger policies to combat CVD worldwide.
