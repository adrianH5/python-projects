Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, while detecting CTCs in clinical samples is still challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of CTCs.
Herein, a triple-mode sensing platform based on an antifouling capture and dual-targeting recognition strategy is presented for sensitive detection of human cervical cancer cells (HeLa).
First, the target CTCs can be specifically captured using antifouling magnetic nanoparticles (AMNPs) encoded with AS1411 aptamers (AMNPs-Apt
