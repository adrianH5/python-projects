Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease that severely affects the quality of life of patients.
Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been widely used in treating the erythema and telangiectasia in rosacea patients.
However, the mechanism of its use is poorly understood.
Our study objectives were to (i) assess the characteristic histological changes in animal models of rosacea with IPL over a microsecond pulse width, (ii) compare the effectiveness of different filter IPL irradiation.
