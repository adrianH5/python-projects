Chordoid glioma (ChG) is a rare, low-grade brain tumor characterized by a novel recurrent point mutation, D463H, in the kinase domain of protein kinase C alpha (PKCα).
The mutation is invariably an Asp to His substitution, suggesting it endows a unique function beyond catalytic inactivation associated with other cancer-associated PKCα mutations.
