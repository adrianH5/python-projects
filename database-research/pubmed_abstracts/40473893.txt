Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a standard first-line chemotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC).
However, its clinical application is often comprised by gastrointestinal toxicity and limited therapeutic efficacy.
Our previous study has revealed that the combination of Vardenafil (Vard) and Linagliptin (Linag) significantly alleviated CPT-11-induced intestinal toxicity in both in vitro and in vivo models.
It remains unclear whether this combination can synergistically enhance the anticancer activity of CPT-11.
