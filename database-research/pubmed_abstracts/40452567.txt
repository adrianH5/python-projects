Anti-obesity medications (AOMs) have not been studied in survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer.
In this retrospective analysis, generalized additive mixed model with penalized spline described body mass index (BMI) over time among survivors of AYA cancer prescribed an AOM.
Body weight and BMI at pre-AOM maximum and last follow-up were summarized, with 95% confidence intervals.
Over a median follow-up time of 249 days, 63.4% of survivors had â‰¥5% weight reduction.
The proportion of survivors with severe obesity decreased from 60% to 35%.
These findings suggest that AOMs are effective for weight reduction in survivors of AYA cancer.
