Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast, accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
Reducing particle count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy.
To address this, denoising low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose generation.
