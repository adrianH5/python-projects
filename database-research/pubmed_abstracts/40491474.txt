Extracellular calcium export by the breast ductal epithelium is crucial during lactation and plays a significant role in breast cancer progression.
Intraductal calcium deposition is a hallmark of aggressive premalignant lesions.
This study tested the hypothesis that microbiome-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) influence calcium modulation in premalignant breast cancer lesions.
Based on the analysis of plasma, serum, saliva, and tissue collected from breast cancer patients and controls (
