The misuse of antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance remain "bottlenecks" in the treatment of infected wounds.
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a new type of non-invasive treatment technology; as the temperature increases, the survival rate of bacteria decreases.
When the photothermal temperature rises approximately or over 50 °C, it may cause irreversible damage to normal tissues, which is detrimental to collagen deposition and blood vessel formation, and even affects the healing effect.
So we used a strategy combining mild photothermal therapy (MPTT) (approximately 45 °C) and drug release to improve the microenvironment of wound infection and promote repair of skin defects.
Therefore, we innovatively designed a bilayer hydrogel microneedle (FG MN) with the chitosan/aldoxylated polyethylene glycol/sodium alginate/Cu
