Surgical reconstruction is recommended for cleft palate patients.
However, improper muscle reconstruction can cause scarring and velopharyngeal insufficiency.
Understanding the developmental patterns of soft palatal musculature is crucial for improving treatments.
Although mice are commonly used to investigate soft palate development, the uvula deficiency in mice limits their applicability.
This study aims to compare the developmental characteristics of soft palate muscles in miniature pigs and mice at various stages to better understand the patterns in large mammals.
