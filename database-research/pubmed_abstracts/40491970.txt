The objective is to identify risk factors that contribute to sex differences in Alzheimer dementia (AD) patients with encephalopathy (ADEN) and determine whether these factors are different between male and female ADEN patients.
This is the first large-scale study comparing sex-specific ADEN risk profiles.
