To explore the application effect of feedback health education in the care of patients after robot-assisted adrenal tumor resection in ambulatory mode.
100 patients who underwent robot-assisted adrenal tumor resection in the ambulatory surgery department of our hospital from June 2022 to June 2024 were randomly selected as the study subjects and were divided into the observation group (n = 50 cases) and the control group (n = 50 cases).
The observation group used feedback health education, the control group used conventional health education, and the two groups were compared with regard to the patients' psychological status, medication adherence, life quality assessment, and patient satisfaction score.
After the intervention, the SAD score of the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group (42.14 ± 3.52 vs. 47.16 ± 4.60, P < 0.001).
SAS scores were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group (43.9 ± 5.06 vs. 48.36 ± 3.89, P < 0.001).
Adherence scores were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (7.16 ± 0.71 vs. 6.56 ± 1.15, P = 0.002), and medication adherence was better in the observation group than in the control group (P = 0.008).
ADL scores were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (85.4 ± 5.09 vs. 80.62 ± 5.70, P < 0.001).
Nursing satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (85.42 ± 4.79 vs. 81.12 ± 4.88, P < 0.001).
Compared with traditional nursing education, the feedback health education method helps improve the psychological state of patients undergoing robotic-assisted adrenal tumor resection in the day mode, and improves medication adherence, quality of life, and nursing satisfaction.
