Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
It is hypothesized that overcoming these barriers requires a dual approach: inducing immunogenic tumor cell death (ICD) and enhancing the cancer immunity cycle by exogenous neoantigen targeting on the spleen.
In this study, a novel strategy is presented combining irinotecan-loaded silicasomes with spleen-targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying KRAS
