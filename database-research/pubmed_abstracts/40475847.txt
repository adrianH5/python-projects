While Deep Learning (DL) auto-segmentation has the potential to improve segmentation efficiency in the radiotherapy workflow, manual adjustments of the predictions are still required.
Network uncertainty quantification has been proposed as a quality assurance tool to ensure an efficient segmentation workflow.
However, the interpretation is often complicated due to various sources of uncertainty interacting non-trivially.
In this work, we compared network predictions with both independent manual segmentations and manual corrections of the predictions.
We assume that manual corrections only address clinically relevant errors and are therefore associated with lower aleatoric uncertainty due to less inter-observer variability.
We expect the remaining epistemic uncertainty to be a better predictor of segmentation corrections.
