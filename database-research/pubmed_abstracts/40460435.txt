Mucosal cancer, a kind of malignancy originating in mucosal tissues and affecting various organs, such as colorectal cancer, is a major health challenge worldwide.
Effective activation of mucosal immunity is crucial for its prevention and treatment.
However, conventional vaccines administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly often fail to stimulate a robust immune response against mucosal cancer.
In contrast, oral mucosal vaccines can harness the extensive mucosal surfaces of the gut for immune activation.
Here, we developed an oral tumor therapeutic vaccine using manganese-rich montmorillonite nanosheets (Mn-MMT@OVA) with promising potential for colorectal cancer immunotherapy.
Upon oral administration, the vaccine adheres to the intestinal mucosa and forms a vaccine depot that gradually releases antigens and Mn
