Accessory breast cancer is a relatively rare condition, and to our knowledge, no previous reports have described synchronous ipsilateral cancers of the breast and the axillary accessory breast.
We report a unique case involving a 70-year-old female patient with luminal A subtype breast cancer and triple-negative accessory breast cancer.
The axillary tumor, which had become ulcerative and exudative, was diagnosed as an accessory breast cancer with high Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.
Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1 was effective.
This case highlights the clinical importance of considering accessory breast cancer as a distinct entity and demonstrates the potential utility of immunotherapy in such cases.
