Thyroid cancer (TC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally.
The incidence rate of thyroid cancer has significantly risen in the past few decades.
Most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer can be effectively treated with thyroidectomy and radioiodine adjuvant therapy.
However, the management of locally advanced or distant metastatic TC remains challenging, especially in radioactive iodine-resistant tumors.
Targeted therapy is the use of drugs designed to target overexpressed molecules in cancer cells.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface protein that plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.
Several studies have indicated that EGFR is overexpressed in thyroid cancer, making it a promising target in cancer treatment.
In this review, we aimed to provide the functional significance of EGFR signaling pathway in TC.
In addition, current strategies using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for treating thyroid cancer are explored.
