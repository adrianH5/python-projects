Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by demonstrating significant efficacy across multiple malignancies.
However, by interfering with immune regulatory pathways, they can lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including immune-mediated enterocolitis.
This study aimed to evaluate the real-world risk of immune-mediated enterocolitis across different ICIs using data from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).
