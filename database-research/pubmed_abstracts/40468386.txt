Accurate assessment and prediction of patient prognosis, early identification of high-risk patients, and improvement of clinical outcomes for individuals with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) are critical.
This study evaluates the prognostic value of a novel model combining maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in ENKTCL patients.
