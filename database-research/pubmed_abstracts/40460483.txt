Rab proteins, a subset of small monomeric GTPases, represent the largest subfamily within the Ras superfamily, which also includes Ras and Rho proteins.
Over 70 Rab members have been identified, acting as molecular switches that toggle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state.
Rab GTPases are crucial for intracellular vesicle formation and membrane trafficking.
Stem cells, known for their self-renewal and multipotent differentiation abilities, likely depend on paracrine signaling mechanisms, essential for their application in regenerative medicine.
Exosomes, pivotal in cellular paracrine communication, are distinguished by their abundance, biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity.
Rab27, a member of the Rab family, is critical in exosome secretion by aiding the targeting of multivesicular endosomes to the cell periphery and their docking at the plasma membrane.
Cancer stem cells, a tumor cell subset with unlimited proliferative capacity, can initiate tumor formation.
Recent research indicates that Rab27 also influences tumor initiation and progression by modulating exosome secretion.
This review summarizes Rab27-mediated exosome secretion regulation and its biological effects on various types of mesenchymal stem cells and cancer stem cells.
