AlkB homolog (ALKBH) belongs to 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and ferrous iron-dependent oxygenases, which can catalyze the demethylation of DNA/RNA and play an important role in human diseases represented by cancer.
Although ALKBH has been extensively studied, the biological explanation for its specific recognition of DNA/RNA and its mechanism of action in cancer remains unclear.
This review explores the molecular mechanism of ALKBH protein binding to DNA/RNA through structural fitting and ChIP-Seq analysis and summarizes the structural biology factors that lead to its specific substrate recognition.
Furthermore, the expression of ALKBH protein across different tissues is systematically compiled, with a tissue-specific expression map generated for 15 organs and 50 tissues.
These maps provide valuable insights into the protein's function in various physiological contexts.
Additionally, this review systematically summarizes the regulatory role of the ALKBH protein in the occurrence and development of cancer.
It highlights the protein's involvement in key signaling pathways, including Wnt, AKT, AMPK, NF-ÎºB, Hippo, and Notch, revealing its potential for application in early diagnosis and targeted cancer therapy.
Overall, this review comprehensively expounds the biological functions of the ALKBH protein and its important role in cancer, which has important theoretical value and application prospects.
