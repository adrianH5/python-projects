Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is an umbrella term for numerous primary immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by B-cell, and sometimes T-cell, impairment.
While CVID is commonly associated with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, gastrointestinal (GI) disease-often presenting atypically due to immune dysregulation-can significantly the increase morbidity and mortality of those affected.
