To analyze the clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging characteristics of severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (SMPP) in children, identify early warning indicators, and characterize macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MRMPP).
Additionally, we developed and validated a nomogram model for predicting the risk of SMPP.
