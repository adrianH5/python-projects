With the increasing prevalence of papillary thyroid carcinoma PTC) and advancements in auxiliary examination technology, the holistic detection rate of malignant thyroid nodules, particularly small ones, continues to rise.
However, there remains controversy surrounding the optimal treatment for PTC, and a crucial factor influencing treatment decisions is the status of central lymph node metastasis (CLNM).
There is a lack of research on the relationship between clinical laboratory results and tumor characteristics observed during surgery and CLNM status.
Therefore, our research aims to systematically explore the risk factor of CLNM in patients with PTC.
