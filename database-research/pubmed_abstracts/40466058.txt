Cancer imposes significant physical and emotional distress not only on patients, but also on their caregivers.
In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the mental and physical well-being of caregivers.
Among various psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is widely recognized as one of the most effective approaches.
However, traditional CBT is often limited by time and geographical constraints, resulting in delayed or inefficient support for caregivers.
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) presents a valuable alternative for alleviating the caregiving burden and the negative emotions experienced by caregivers.
