To present our experience with re-operative retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy (Re-RetroPN), evaluate its feasibility and safety, and compare perioperative outcomes, including renal function metrics, pathology, and complication rates, between patients that underwent Re-RetroPN and those that underwent re-operative transperitoneal robotic partial nephrectomy (Re-TransPN).
