In the original classification, oxyntic gland neoplasms (OGNs) are classified as carcinoma based on the submucosal (SM) involvement and differentiation into MUC5AC- and MUC6-positive cells.
Some cases without structural or nuclear atypia or desmoplastic reaction (DR) in the SM layer, which is essential for typical carcinoma, are also categorized as carcinoma of OGNs.
To address potential overdiagnoses, we conducted a histopathological review of OGNs to propose a clinically relevant reevaluation.
