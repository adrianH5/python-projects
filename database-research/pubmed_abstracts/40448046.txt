Effective communication skills are fundamental for health care professionals, yet conventional training methods face challenges in scalability and accessibility due to resource constraints.
The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, offers innovative ways for enhancing communication skills training by simulating realistic conversational scenarios and providing personalised, adaptive feedback.
This manuscript is presented as study protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled trial that aims at evaluating the efficacy of an AI-supported higher education training protocol incorporating generative AI exercises to enhance communication competencies among psychology students.
