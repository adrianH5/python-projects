Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have transformed breast cancer treatment by enabling the targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents.
However, the optimal sequencing of ADCs remains undefined, with factors such as target antigen, linker type, and payload mechanism variably influencing their efficacy and safety.
This review examines current ADC applications and limitations, focusing on resistance mechanisms and challenges related to limited real-world data, small study populations, and the absence of head-to-head clinical comparisons.
While randomized clinical trials could clarify sequencing strategies, the lack of planned studies makes high-quality evidence unlikely in the near future.
The rapid evolution of ADC technology further complicates these considerations, as next-generation ADCs or novel combinations may prove superior before sequencing strategies are fully established.
This highlights the need for continuous reassessment to align treatment approaches with advances in precision oncology and the evolving breast cancer landscape.
