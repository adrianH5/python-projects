Recent studies have identified a co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure in ICU patients.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between RDW and in-hospital mortality in patients with concurrent congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
