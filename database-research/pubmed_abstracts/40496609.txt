Thrombocytopenia (TP) is a rare adverse event (<1%) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, termed immunotherapy-related thrombocytopenia (irTP).
This condition is particularly concerning in patients with metastatic bone cancer due to the increased risk of life-threatening bleeding complications, which may further compromise patient management.
Moreover, the scarcity of systematic reports on irTP in this population underscores the need for focused investigation.
