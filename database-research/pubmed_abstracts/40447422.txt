Cervical screening rates in the UK are falling, limiting our ability to prevent cervical cancer.
Peak incidence of cervical cancer coincides with average age of childbirth, and women with young children are less likely to be screened.
Current UK guidelines advise waiting 12 weeks after delivery to perform cervical screening, but this recommendation is not based on evidence from the era of liquid-based cytology or high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing.
New mums suggested offering cervical screening at 6 weeks postdelivery, in conjunction with the postnatal check-up with the general practice team in primary care.
This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a paired-sample study design for cervical screening at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postnatal.
