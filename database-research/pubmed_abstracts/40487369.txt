Most older people with advanced kidney disease face a decision between conservative kidney management (CKM) or dialysis and must weigh their potential benefits, risks and impacts on quality and length of life.
Patient information documents are designed to supplement patients' understanding of their kidney disease and explain treatment options to support decision-making.
We aimed to explore how patient information documents frame the treatment options of CKM and dialysis and consider implications for patients' treatment choice.
