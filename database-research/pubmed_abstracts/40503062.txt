Previous studies have suggested that serum uric acid (SUA), a byproduct of purine metabolism, may be associated with cancer development.
However, the relationship between SUA levels and skin cancers-malignant melanoma (MM) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)-remains poorly understood.
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between serum uric acid levels and the risk of malignant melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.
