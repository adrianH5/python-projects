Explosive tumor growth is characterized by rapid tumor growth in a short time period.
Currently, there is no precise scientific definition for the condition, which is often accompanied with a poor clinical prognosis.
Herein, we presented a study of a young patient with colon cancer who experienced explosive tumor growth.
A clinical multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaborated with bioinformaticians to provide precise treatment and elucidate the biological mechanisms underpinning this growth.
