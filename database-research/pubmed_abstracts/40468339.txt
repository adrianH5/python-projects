According to the latest World Health Organization report, approximately half of the new cancer cases in Iran are attributed to five common cancers: gastric, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer.
These cancers impose a heavy economic burden on healthcare systems and society, including direct medical costs (DMC), direct non-medical costs (DNMC), and indirect costs (IDC).
This systematic review aimed to investigate the economic burden of these cancers in Iran.
