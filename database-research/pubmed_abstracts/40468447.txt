Lactate is a crucial product of cancer metabolism, creating an acidic environment that supports cancer growth and acts as a substrate for lactylation.
Lactylation, a newly discovered epigenetic modification, plays a vital role in cancer cell signaling, metabolic reprogramming, immune response, and other functions.
This review explores the regulation of lactylation, summarizes recent research on its role in cancers, and highlights its application in cancer drug resistance and immunotherapy.
These insights aim to provide new avenues for targeting lactylation in cancer therapy.
