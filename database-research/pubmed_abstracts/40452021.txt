Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy in the gastrointestinal tract and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.
Despite the identification of numerous biomarkers, their non-specific distribution across different cell types complicates the development of targeted therapies.
Therefore, this study aims to identify specific biomarkers for CRC and utilize them for the development of targeted therapies.
