Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable noncoding RNAs that play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases, and they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).
However, their underlying molecular mechanisms in POCD remain poorly understood.
This study identified hsa_circRNA_061570 as significantly upregulated in plasma after anesthesia/surgery using high-throughput circRNA microarray screening, correlating with cognitive decline.
Its murine homolog, circITSN1, was further investigated using shRNA-mediated knockdown in the hippocampus.
Behavioral tests (open field, Y maze, and fear conditioning) revealed that circITSN1 suppression improved spatial and contextual memory without affecting motor function.
Neuronal damage analysis via Golgi staining demonstrated that circITSN1 knockdown alleviated synaptic and dendritic spine impairments.
Mechanistically, circITSN1 directly bound to RNA-binding protein EIF4A3, stabilizing
