The Brain Care Score (BCS) was developed in partnership with patients and practitioners to convey actionable knowledge to individuals everywhere that can motivate change in health-related behaviors and thereby reduce the risk of dementia, stroke, and late-life depression (LLD).
Because diseases outside the brain share modifiable risk factors with dementia, stroke, and LLD, we investigated the associations of the BCS with other common age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer.
