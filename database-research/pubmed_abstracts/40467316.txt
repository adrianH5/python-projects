Cervical cancer is a major global health issue.
The standard treatment for locally advanced disease involves radiochemotherapy followed by uterovaginal brachytherapy (UBT).
UBT requires several days of hospitalisation and strict bed rest.
UBT often induces pain, anxiety, stress, distress and a decline in physical capacity during and after treatment.
Previous research suggests that non-pharmacological interventions, such as yoga, may help alleviate these issues.
However, few studies have specifically evaluated their effectiveness in reducing stress during UBT.
Furthermore, patient education has been shown to facilitate autonomous practice and to improve patient empowerment.
This study aims to evaluate the impact of the KYOCOL protocol, which integrates both a physiotherapy-yoga intervention and an educational programme, on perceived stress and its correlates in patients undergoing UBT.
