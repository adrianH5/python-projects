Diagnosis with cancer can be a shocking, life-altering, and traumatic experience for both the affected patient and their family, which may include immediate or extended family, significant others, and caregivers.
Living with or surviving cancer can negatively impact the patient and their family members individually, and it can also result in negative effects on the patient-family dyad.
In the US alone, the American Cancer Society anticipates approximately 2 million new cases of cancer in 2024; moreover, as many as 25% to 30% of cancer survivors experience anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder.
Although healthcare providers are often pressed for time during routine initial and follow-up appointments, exploration of the person with cancer's journey through the disease course must be a priority and a collaborative effort.
Prompt identification of mental health disorders, including substance use disorders, in people with cancer and their family members is essential to the well-being of the dyad.
Many primary care providers provide both primary care services and survivorship care, such as posttreatment preexisting and secondary cancer surveillance, to cancer survivors.
Primary care NPs are therefore well positioned to screen, assess, and treat mental health conditions in the cancer survivor and their family.
The primary care NP also may have a greater opportunity to interface with patients' family members, thereby promoting healthier families and societies.
