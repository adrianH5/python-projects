The purpose of the study is to investigate the degree and performance in the differential diagnosis of bronchiectasis/airspace enlargement in an iodine map obtainable from CT pulmonary angiography compared with monochromatic images.
This retrospective study included 62 patients with a lung nodule who underwent CT pulmonary angiography.
The iodine map and monochromatic image (70 keV) were reconstructed.
Three readers evaluated the degree of bronchiectasis/airspace enlargement with a 4-point scale.
A reference standard was established in 39 patients, and the performance of bronchiectasis/airspace enlargement in the differential diagnosis was evaluated in them.
The degree of bronchiectasis/airspace enlargement in the iodine map (median score = 1/2/1 for reader 1/2/3) was significantly more prominent than that in the monochromatic image (median score = 0/1/0 for reader 1/2/3) (p < 0.001 for all readers).
Using bronchiectasis/airspace enlargement, primary lung carcinoma and malignant lymphoma could be differentiated from other diseases, excluding lung infarct, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (reader 1/2/3) of 0.718/0.867/0.803 in the combinations of iodine map plus monochromatic image and 0.496/0.828/0.450 in the monochromatic image (p ≤ 0.047 for two readers).
Lung metastasis from colorectal carcinoma could be differentiated from other diseases with an AUC of 0.851/0.976/0.838 in the combinations of iodine map plus monochromatic image, which was significantly superior to the monochromatic image (0.378/0.780/0.459) (p ≤ 0.012 for all readers).
Bronchiectasis/airspace enlargement was more prominently observed in the iodine map than in the monochromatic image.
This image finding in the iodine map provided added value in the differential diagnosis of malignant lung nodules compared with monochromatic images alone.
