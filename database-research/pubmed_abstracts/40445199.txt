Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapeutics offer the potential to treat a variety of pulmonary disorders that arise due to genetics, infectious diseases, and chronic respiratory conditions.
However, various physiological barriers in the lungs, such as mucociliary clearance, macrophage phagocytosis, and lung surfactant interference, present challenges for efficient mRNA delivery.
Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a therapeutic platform for delivering mRNA therapeutics due to their stability, tunability, and controlled release properties, making them suitable and potentially ideal for encapsulating and protecting mRNA molecules for delivery
