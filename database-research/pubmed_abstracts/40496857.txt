Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide.
Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the innate immune system and exhibit significant anti-tumor activity.
However, the role of NK cell-related genes (NRGs) in BC diagnosis and prognosis remains underexplored.
With the advent of machine learning (ML) techniques, predictive modeling based on NRGs may offer a new avenue for precision oncology.
