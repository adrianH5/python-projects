The growing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) presents an opportunity to enhance patient care by uncovering hidden health risks and improving informed decisions through advanced deep learning methods.
However, modeling EHR sequential data, that is, patient trajectories, is challenging due to the evolving relationships between diagnoses and treatments over time.
Significant progress has been achieved using transformers and self-supervised learning.
While BERT-inspired models using masked language modeling (MLM) capture EHR context, they often struggle with the complex temporal dynamics of disease progression and interventions.
