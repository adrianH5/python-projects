Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor primarily treated through surgery.
Concurrently, radiation therapy has gained attention as an important local treatment modality.
However, its application in gastric cancer remains limited, with ongoing debates on radiation standards.
Given that bibliometrics serves as a potent tool to unveil scientific literature, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of literature on radiation therapy for gastric cancer.
We explored emerging trends, common patterns in research, tracked collaborations and networks, and anticipated future directions in this clinical context.
