Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and multi-modal profiling with the addition of cell-surface antibodies (scDAb-seq) have recently provided key insights into cancer heterogeneity.
Scaling these technologies across large patient cohorts, however, is cost and time prohibitive.
Multiplexing, in which cells from unique patients are pooled into a single experiment, offers a possible solution.
While multiplexing methods exist for scRNAseq, accurate demultiplexing in scDNAseq remains an unmet need.
