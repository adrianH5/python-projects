Endometriosis is a chronic condition where tissue similar to the endometrium grows outside the uterus, affecting 5-10% of women and causing pelvic pain, painful periods, and infertility.
Diseases of the endometrium, the lining of the uterus, can lead to a variety of reproductive health issues, including infertility, irregular bleeding, and endometrial cancer.
Researchers have developed advanced in vitro systems using uterine organoids and decellularized tissue scaffolds to understand and model these diseases.
The main limitations of traditional 2D monolayer cultures include reduced biological activity, reduced hormone responsiveness, and lack of interaction with ECM.
Researchers have investigated 3D culture approaches to address these shortcomings, such as scaffold-free organoids and decellularized tissue scaffolds.
Organoid systems can better recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity and physiological functions of the native endometrium.
Decellularization protocols have been optimized to generate intact uterine scaffolds that preserve the structural and compositional features of the ECM.
Implantation of these bioscaffolds into animal models demonstrated their biocompatibility and regenerative potential.
Further refinements of organoid and scaffold technologies, including chemically defined matrices and organ-on-a-chip platforms, will improve our ability to model the uterus.
Integration of these advanced in vitro models with patient-derived cells will enable personalized disease modeling and the development of targeted therapies.
The combination of organoids, decellularized scaffolds, and microfluidic technologies holds great potential for exploring reproductive biology, drug screening, and developing regenerative therapies for uterine diseases and infertility.
