Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with highest incidence rates in Asia.
Endoscopic screening may facilitate early detection and reduces mortality, but its cost-effectiveness in Western populations, where GC is less prevalent, remains unclear.
This review aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic screening and surveillance for GC in Western countries, considering regional epidemiologic and economic differences.
