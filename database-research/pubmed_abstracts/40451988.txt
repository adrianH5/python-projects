Alterations in the bone marrow (BM) tumor microenvironment (TME) are closely associated with the progression of premalignant clonal plasma cells in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to malignant clonal plasma cells in multiple myeloma (MM), though the extent to which these alterations are causative remains unclear.
Whether lipidomic changes are part of the BM TME alterations associated with this disease progression remains poorly understood.
