With the rapid development of the radiotheranostic field, developing new methods to produce radiolabeled agents has become a critical area of exploration.
We hypothesized that the inert carbon shell of carbon dots (CDs) could serve as a robust chelation strategy to overcome the stability issue of radiometal complexes, including the recoil energy issue of alpha (Î±)-emitting radioisotopes.
To investigate this, we utilized radioactive copper-64 (
