SARS-CoV-2 is known to impact patients with cancer adversely.
Previous meta-analyses have lacked clarity on the recency of cancer diagnosis, anti-cancer treatment durations, and SARS-CoV-2 specific variants of concern (VOC).
This study aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 multivariable-adjusted clinical outcomes between patients with cancer and those without cancer, identifying key risk factors spanning pre- and post-Omicron periods.
