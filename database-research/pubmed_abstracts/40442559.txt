CDK2 inhibition is a promising breast cancer treatment.
Purines target CDK2 and are effective against breast cancer, proving a therapeutic scaffold.
New purine-based compounds, 5a-5j were synthesized using chloro-amine coupling and phenacylation in a two-step procedure, characterized, and tested for anticancer activity.
The highest yield (82%), without column purification or a costly catalyst like Pd/Cu, was achieved with concentrated HCl.
The synthesis and site-selective substitution at the purine ring's C-2 position were confirmed by
