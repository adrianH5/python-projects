Bronchogenic cysts (BCs) are rare congenital anomalies that often present without distinct clinical symptoms, complicating their diagnosis.
However, as these cysts enlarge, they can cause symptoms due to compression of adjacent tissues and organs.
In February 2024, a 32-year-old male was admitted to the Central Hospital of Suining City, Sichuan Province, China, with a preliminary diagnosis of a "gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumor."
A thorough pathological evaluation ultimately confirmed the diagnosis as a BC.
The cyst was successfully excised through surgical intervention.
