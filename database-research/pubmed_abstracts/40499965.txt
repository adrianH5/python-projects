International survivorship guideline consortia have developed strategies to prevent, detect and manage late effects of childhood cancer survivors.
However, recommendations do not adequately reflect the everyday reality of paediatric oncology care in low- and middle-income countries.
In this study protocol, a survivorship intervention programme, comprising an educational component and a follow-up component, is described.
The Educational Programme aims to improve follow-up adherence of childhood cancer survivors through increasing survivorship knowledge of caregivers.
The Follow-up Programme aims to map late effects by implementing a follow-up form at the outpatient clinic to be used by trained healthcare providers.
