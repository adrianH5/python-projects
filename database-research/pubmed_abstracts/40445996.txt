Eccrine poroma (EP) and porocarcinoma (EPC) arise from the intraepidermal part of the sweat gland.
Clinically they resemble each other and cannot be distinguished without histopathological examination.
EPC has been described as aggressive; however, the Ki-67 index is scarcely reported.
The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathological factors between EP and EPC with special interest in Ki-67 index.
