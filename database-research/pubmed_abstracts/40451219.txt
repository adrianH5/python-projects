The da Vinci surgical system (DVSS) has been the prevalent surgical robotic platform; however, novel systems, such as the hinotori surgical robot system (HSRS), are emerging.
In this study, we compared the short-term surgical outcomes and step-specific operative times between the DVSS and HSRS for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
