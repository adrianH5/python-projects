Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently present with liver metastases, which severely limit treatment options and prognosis.
In other cancers, treatment of liver disease can improve outcomes and similar approaches are being explored in PDAC.
Clinical data for locoregional control of pancreatic cancer liver metastases (PCLM) are limited, and histotripsy offers a new noninvasive tool for disease control.
This study evaluates the preliminary safety, efficacy, and imaging findings of histotripsy in patients with PCLM.
