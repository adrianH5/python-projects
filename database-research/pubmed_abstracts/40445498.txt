Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in several types of malignancies.
Designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) Ec1 is a 19 kDa engineered scaffold protein that binds with high affinity to EpCAM.
Radiolabelled Ec1 might be used as a companion diagnostic for the selection of patients for personalized therapy.
This study aimed to investigate the influence of different radiometal-chelator complexes on the biodistribution and imaging contrast of
