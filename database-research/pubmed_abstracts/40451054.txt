Early detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) significantly improves survival rates, yet reliable biochemical biomarkers for early diagnosis remain limited.
The aim of this study is to identify potential early diagnostic biomarkers by integrating trace element and oxidative stress profiling with machine learning.
This study investigates alterations in trace elements and oxidative stress-related biomarkers in cancerous and adjacent healthy esophageal tissues (used as paired controls) using ICP-MS and spectrophotometric biochemical assays.
