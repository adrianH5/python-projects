This study aims to explore the value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques-dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and T2-weighted fat-suppressed imaging (T2WI)-in predicting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) status in breast cancer by integrating intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features to establish a multiparametric MRI intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics model.
