Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of synovial tissue, is divided into two subtypes-anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive and ACPA-negative RA.
While the pathogenic mechanisms of ACPA-positive RA are well-understood, the etiology of ACPA-negative RA remains largely unknown.
The association between RA and periodontitis (PD) has been observed since the early 1900s, with the two diseases sharing common genetic and environmental risk factors that lead to the progressive destruction of bone and connective tissue.
However, the associations between PD and the two subtypes of RA differ.
This comprehensive review aims to provide an updated understanding of the epidemiological association between RA and PD, explore potential pathogenic mechanisms linking the two diseases, and highlight the key distinctions between the subtypes of RA and their respective associations with PD.
We also discuss the possibility of early intervention or the treatment of the two diseases.
Ultimately, this review aims to provide valuable insights for future research in this field.
