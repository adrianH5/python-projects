Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) is a rare type of kidney cancer that is generally associated with a favorable prognosis.
By contrast, RCC with sarcomatoid transformation exhibits a more aggressive clinical course, with its pathogenesis remaining largely unclear.
The present study reports a case of ChRCC with sarcomatoid changes.
A 54-year-old woman presented to the Department of Urology for evaluation of an incidentally detected left renal mass.
Histological examination of the resected tumor revealed two distinct components: One with conventional ChRCC morphology and the other comprising highly pleomorphic, poorly differentiated cells.
Next-generation sequencing of the two components revealed chromosomal losses in multiple chromosomes and variations in the
