MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in various biological processes, and their dysregulation is associated with numerous diseases.
Accurate quantification of mature miRNAs is essential for their use as biomarkers.
However, distinguishing between mature miRNAs and pre-miRNAs remains challenging.
This study introduces a novel method called Blocker Displacement SMOS-qPCR (BL-SMOS-qPCR) to enhance the differentiation between miRNAs and pre-miRNAs.
The method employs a blocker sequence complementary to the 3' end of pre-miRNA cDNA, effectively competing with the Linker sequence and reducing non-specific amplification.
We optimized various parameters, including blocker modification, length, concentration, and reaction temperature.
Results showed that MGB-modified blockers at optimal concentrations significantly improved discrimination between miRNAs and pre-miRNAs, reducing pre-miRNA signals by approximately 3.2-fold.
The BL-SMOS-qPCR maintained similar dynamic ranges (6ËŸ10
