Patients with intestinal failure (IF) are dependent on tunneled central venous catheters (CVC) to provide parenteral nutrition.
A method using a fibrous sheath (FS) was developed to preserve the central venous routes while exchanging CVC.
We focused on the reduction of punctured catheter insertions for the FS method.
