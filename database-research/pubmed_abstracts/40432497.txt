Firefighters face significantly elevated cancer risks due to chronic exposure to carcinogenic fire effluents and occupational stressors.
In 2022, the World Health Organization classified firefighting as a carcinogenic occupation, linking it to increased incidences of cancers, including mesothelioma, bladder, prostate, colon and melanoma.
Drawing on UK-specific data where possible, this narrative review explores how dietary strategies, particularly the Mediterranean diet, may complement existing protective measures in mitigating these risks.
It investigates specific food-based nutrients that show promise in addressing risks associated with fire effluent contaminants, examining nutrient-mediated mechanisms and their relevance to firefighter health.
The review also highlights the distinct combination of challenges firefighters face in adopting healthier dietary patterns, including disrupted routines, group eating cultures and gaps in nutritional education.
While the evidence for firefighter-specific dietary interventions is still emerging, this review highlights the potential of sustainable dietary strategies to significantly reduce cancer risks and improve long-term health outcomes.
Finally, it calls for targeted research and interventions to refine these strategies and deliver tangible health benefits for firefighters worldwide.
