This case report highlights a rare instance of colonic intussusception mimicking strangulated rectal prolapse in a woman.
Initially misdiagnosed with strangulated rectal prolapse, the patient presented with a painful, irreducible rectal mass.
Unexpected clinical signs led to further imaging, revealing colonic intussusception with a malignant mass.
This underscores the diagnostic challenges of overlapping symptoms and the necessity of thorough examinations to detect subtle anatomical differences.
An emergency CT scan showed a prolapsed sigmoid colon prompting a total mesorectal excision and end colostomy due to poor sphincter tone, with positive postoperative results.
This case emphasises maintaining a high suspicion for alternative diagnoses in ambiguous rectal masses and advocates for a multidisciplinary approach using advanced imaging when examinations are atypical.
An accurate preoperative diagnosis and tailored surgical strategy are crucial for optimal outcomes, highlighting the importance of individualised management in complex colorectal cases.
