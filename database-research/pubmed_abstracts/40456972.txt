The National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers (NAPBC) developed comprehensive, multidisciplinary standards to improve quality outcomes.
We have previously shown that institutions treating larger proportions of breast cancer patients of low socioeconomic status (SES) achieve these benchmarks at lower rates.
This study assesses whether a patient's SES interacts with an institution's SES mix in achieving the 2018 NAPBC standards.
