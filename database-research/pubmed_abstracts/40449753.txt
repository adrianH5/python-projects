Fluorouracil (Fu) is one of the first-line drugs for colorectal cancer, but severe intestinal damage limits its clinical application.
The intestinal damage caused by Fu is closely related to cellular senescence.
Itraconazole (Itr) is primarily used to treat fungal infections.
At present, the effects of Itr on intestinal senescence and damage have not been the subject of extensive study.
In this study, NCM460 cells were utilized to establish a model of Fu-induced senescence and inflammation.
Treatment of NCM460 cells with Fu resulted in increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity, elevated p21 expression, and the upregulation of p16 and p53.
Additionally, there was enhanced Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) and an increase in inflammatory factors IL-1β and IL-6.
The present study demonstrated that the treatment of Itr effectively alleviated the changes caused by Fu in NCM460 cells.
Moreover, it was observed that Itr was efficacious in mitigating intestinal damage induced by Fu in Balb/c mice.
Network pharmacology analysis and experimental validation identified the mTOR signaling pathway as a key target of Itr in treating Fu-induced intestinal aging and inflammation.
Our findings demonstrate that Itr significantly inhibited the mTOR pathway, while the mTOR activator MHY1485 restored mTOR activity and promoted senescence.
Moreover, it was observed that Itr could effectively enhance the tumor-killing effect of Fu in HCT116 and SW480 cells, as well as in Balb/c nude mice.
In conclusion, Itr is a promising candidate for reducing intestinal side effects and enhancing Fu's efficacy in the treatment of colorectal cancer.
