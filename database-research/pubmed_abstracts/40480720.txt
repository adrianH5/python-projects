Glioblastoma exhibits a very poor prognosis and profound metabolic alterations associated to its aggressiveness.
Examining tumor metabolic states is crucial for identifying potential therapeutic targets, enabling personalized medicine applications.
However, direct access to the functional glioblastoma tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo is highly challenging, particularly due to the tumor location and risk of blood-brain-barrier disruption.
Here, we developed a novel research platform combining the innovative sampling technology cerebral open flow microperfusion (cOFM) and HILIC-HRMS-based metabolomics to comprehensively characterize the local metabolic phenotype of human glioblastoma in xenograft animal model.
