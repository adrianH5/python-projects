Radiation therapy can trigger activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)- Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) axis via cytoplasmic dsDNA fragment induction.
The activation of cGAS-STING initiates innate immune signaling mediated by interferon type I that can contribute to eradicate the malignancy.
The effect was shown to depend on the fractionation scheme employed.
We hypothesized that the innate immune response can also depend on radiation quality because densely ionizing radiation, such as carbon ions, have different effects on DNA lesion quality.
