Radiotherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
However, the number and close proximity of organs at risk (OAR) hampers dose escalation using classical techniques.
The Leksell Gamma KnifeÂ® (LGK, Elekta AB) achieves a steep dose gradient, which might be beneficial to apply sequential/upfront boosts to these tumors.
This study explores the feasibility of fractionated, homogeneous LGK Icon boost compared to a linear accelerator (LINAC) boost.
