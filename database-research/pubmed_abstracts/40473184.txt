Dacomitinib is a pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), approved for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with human epidermal growth factor receptor 1(EGFR)-sensitive mutations.
The use of dacomitinib is limited because of its cutaneous toxicity.
Since the exact mechanism of dacomitinib-induced cutaneous toxicity is unknown, effective targeted prophylaxis and therapy remain unavailable.
Our study established an animal model of dacomitinib-induced cutaneous toxicity and found that dacomitinib induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in keratinocytes with enhanced secretion of inflammatory factors.
Mechanistically, we found that the retinoid pathway in keratinocytes was activated by dacomitinib, with significant upregulation of the key enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), which appears to be a key factor in cutaneous toxicity.
ALDH1A1 knockdown reversed the apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by dacomitinib in keratinocytes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.
Furthermore, silibinin was shown to mitigate dacomitinib-induced cutaneous toxicity by reducing ALDH1A1.
Overall, this study highlights the critical role of ALDH1A1 in drug-induced cutaneous toxicity and its potential as an interventional target.
