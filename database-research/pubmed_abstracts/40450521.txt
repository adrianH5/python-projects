Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer deaths, with poor outcomes in advanced stages.
CD47, overexpressed in CRC, helps tumors evade immune detection by blocking macrophage phagocytosis, while CD47 blockade has shown limited efficacy in CRC.
Our study showed that dual blockade of CD47 and TNFR2 demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects in murine colorectal cancer models.
Since TNFR2 was highly expressed on Tregs and M-MDSCs, combination therapy targeting both CD47 and TNFR2 was tested, resulting in improved tumor control, prolonged survival, and enhanced immune responses by reducing Tregs and M-MDSCs further increasing CD8
