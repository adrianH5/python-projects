Recent years have seen major advances in tau-associated brain disorders through interdisciplinary research spanning molecular biology, neuroimaging, clinical trials, and therapeutic development.
The Tau2024 Global Conference, hosted by the Alzheimer's Association, CurePSP, and Rainwater Charitable Foundation, showcased these efforts by bringing together researchers and experts worldwide to discuss the latest advancements in tau research.
The conference aimed to attract talent and funding to study tauopathies, particularly among early-career researchers, and to foster interdisciplinary alignment and collaboration around challenges in tau research.
In this manuscript, we summarize proceedings of the Tau2024 Global Conference, covering a wide range of topics, including lived experiences of individuals with genetic forms of tauopathies, global perspectives on tauopathies, and molecular mechanisms, brain microenvironments, biomarker developments, clinical trials, and therapeutic approaches to tauopathies.
Through international, collaborative efforts, innovative research, and a commitment to inclusivity, researchers worldwide have demonstrated transformative breakthroughs toward diagnosing, treating, and, ultimately, preventing tau-related diseases.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Tau2024 Global Conference presented updates and advances in tau research.
Blood-based biomarkers offer specificity and longitudinal monitoring capabilities.
There are a range of targetable mechanisms in the cascade of pathogenesis.
International collaboration is vital to address disparities in tauopathies.
