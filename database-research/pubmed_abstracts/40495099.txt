Accurate preoperative segmentation of key anatomical regions on the liver surface is essential for enabling intraoperative navigation and position monitoring.
However, current automatic segmentation methods face challenges due to the liver's drastic shape variations and limited data availability.
This study aims to develop a two-stream mesh convolutional network (TSMCN) that integrates both global geometric and local topological information to achieve accurate, automatic segmentation of key anatomical regions.
