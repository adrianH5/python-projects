Male occult breast cancers are extremely rare and often difficult to diagnose.
With only few cases reported, no established treatment is available.
And metastatic spread to the small intestine from a tumor originating outside the peritoneal cavity is rare.
However, there is a higher tendency for metastasis to the peritoneal cavity, including the small bowel, in the case of lobular carcinoma of the breast.
