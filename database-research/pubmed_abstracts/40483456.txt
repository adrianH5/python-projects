The incidence of EOGC has been increasing, while COGC has decreased over the past few decades.
The objective of this study was to identify differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis and to verify survival results among early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC), conventional-onset gastric cancer (COGC), late-onset gastric cancer (LOGC), and within the adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) group.
