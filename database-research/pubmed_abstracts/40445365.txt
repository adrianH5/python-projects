Local-regional therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and lenvatinib has shown promising anti-tumor activity in advanced biliary tract cancer.
However, the efficacy and safety of integrating local-regional therapy with chemotherapy, ICIs, and lenvatinib in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remain unclear.
This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment combining local-regional therapy, chemotherapy, ICIs, and lenvatinib in advanced ICC.
