Early cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy are crucial for improving patient outcomes.
Proteomics provides a promising approach for discovering drug targets by analyzing differential protein expression.
This study employs Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) technology to identify and validate protein biomarkers in colorectal cancer patients, highlighting their potential as pharmacological targets.
SELDI-TOF-MS was utilized to compare the serum protein profiles of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls.
Differentially expressed proteins were identified and analyzed using Biomarkers Wizard software, with an emphasis on their potential role in drug sensitivity and therapeutic applications.
Fifteen significant protein peaks were identified, with six showing substantial expression changes pre- and post-surgery.
These proteins may serve as drug targets, offering insights for personalized cancer therapy.
The identified protein markers not only aid in early cancer diagnosis but also have potential as therapeutic targets, paving the way for novel drug development and individualized treatment strategies.
