Personalized immunotherapy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through T-cell mediated targeting of tumor-specific, mutanome-encoded neoepitopes may offer new opportunities to combat this disease, in particular by countering recurrence after primary tumor resection.
However, the sensitive and accurate calling of somatic mutations in PDAC tissue samples is compromised by the low tumor cell content.
Moreover, the repertoire of immunogenic neoepitopes in PDAC is limited due to the low mutational load of the majority of these tumors.
