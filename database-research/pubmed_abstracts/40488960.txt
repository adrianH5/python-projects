The accurate diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is crucial in the treatment workflow, and the process is often time-consuming for clinicians.
Recent deep learning models predicting whether lymph nodes are affected by cancer in esophageal cancer cases suffer from challenging node delineation and hence gain poor diagnosis accuracy.
This paper proposes an innovative multi-task and multi-scale attention network (M
