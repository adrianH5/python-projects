This research evaluates the impact of Mg and Cu doping on the structural, compositional, optical, hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, anticancer, antibacterial, antioxidant, and hemolytic properties of the nanosheets (NSs).
Based on the XRD analysis, it was found that the produced NSs consist of a cubic structure with exceptional purity.
In addition, the inclusion of Mg and Cu led to a decreased in the mean crystallite size.
TEM analysis revealed the presence of crumpled NSs.
DLS and zeta potential measurements indicated that the hydrodynamic diameter is significantly larger than the size observed in XRD results, along with low colloidal stability.
Cytotoxicity studies on human melanoma (A375) cells and human epidermal melanocytes-adult (HEMa) demonstrated that ZnS NSs significantly enhanced cytotoxic effects on cancer cells while preserving the viability of normal cells.
Specifically, Cu doped and (Cu, Mg) dual doped ZnS reduced cell viability 13.54 % (Mg = 0 %), 12.64 % (Mg = 1 %), and 13.89 % (Mg = 2 %), while maintaining a high viability of 85.4 % in HEMa cells.
Moreover, the TUNEL assay confirmed that the cell death was predominantly mediated by apoptosis, as indicated by an increased number of apoptotic-positive cells.
The dual-doped ZnS NSs exhibited substantial antibacterial properties against fungal pathogens Candida albicans, and gram-positive microbe Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus as well as gram-negative microbe Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.
The ZCM4 NSs exhibit higher antioxidant activity is 96.67 %.
The produced NSs were evaluated for their hemolytic activity.
