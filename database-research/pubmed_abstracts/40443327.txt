With the advancement of diagnostic/therapeutic technologies and evolving treatment paradigms, the management of gastric cancer has progressively transitioned toward precision medicine and minimally invasive strategies.
This review delineates cutting-edge developments in minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer through a tumor stage-specific framework.
For early-stage gastric cancer, therapeutic strategies are transitioning from standardized resection to precision-oriented, function-preserving gastrectomy.
Endoscopic therapies, laparoscopy-endoscopy cooperative surgery, and various function-preserving procedures have been continuously refined.
For locally advanced disease, minimally invasive surgery represented by laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery have achieved remarkable progress, synergizing with neoadjuvant therapies to establish multimodal collaborative treatment strategies.
Although conversion therapy enables minimally invasive surgical opportunities for select patients with initially unresectable tumors, critical challenges persist in optimizing patient selection criteria, determining optimal surgical timing, and standardizing operative approaches.
Looking forward, minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer is poised to advance through multidimensional innovations, ultimately delivering enhanced therapeutic outcomes and improved long-term quality of life for patients.
