Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant levels are out of equilibrium, which leads to oxidative stress.
When ROS levels rise, tissues are destroyed by protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation, and mutagenesis, which activates the cell death pathway.
Low levels of ROS can regulate cell survival and metabolic pathways to stimulate cell proliferation.
Normal cells don't create as much ROS as cancer cells do.
The endolysosomal cation channel MCOLN channels have been shown to integrate multiple processes of cell growth, division, and metabolic activities, according to recent investigations.
Dysregulation of MCOLN channels activity is associated with cancer development.
This review aims to discuss the current role of MCOLN channels in cancer as novel regulators of redox homeostasis, with the aim of exploiting the oncogenic potential of MCOLN channels to inspire therapeutic interventions.
