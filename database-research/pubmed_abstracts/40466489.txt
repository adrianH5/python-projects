Depression is a common comorbidity among cancer patients, including those with colorectal cancer (CRC), often requiring the use of antidepressants such as citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
While citalopram is primarily prescribed for its central nervous system effects, its absorption through the gastrointestinal system raises questions about its direct impact on intestinal cells.
This study investigates the dual effects of citalopram on healthy and cancerous colorectal cells to elucidate its potential role beyond mood regulation.
Using Raman spectroscopy and imaging combined with statistical analysis, we evaluated the biochemical and structural changes induced by citalopram in normal and CRC human cells.
Raman imaging with selective filters for specific chemical compound groups was used to assess the spatial distribution of lipids (1400-1488Â cm
