Recent findings in the cell death field have transformed our understanding of the interplay between metabolism and cell death in the context of cancer.
In this review, we discuss the relationships between metabolism and the cell death pathways of apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, with a particular focus on recent advancements.
We will also explore the regulation of metabolism by the BCL-2 family and the participation of oncometabolites in the regulation of cell death.
Finally, we examine the emerging links between cell death signaling and cellular persistence.
As we highlight in this review, the intersection of metabolic and cell death pathways has implications for cancer cell survival, treatment resistance, and the tumor microenvironment.
