Tobacco use is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and American Indian/Alaska Native people have high rates of tobacco-related diseases.
Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved products and evidence-based methods exist for smoking cessation, people who smoke might use E-cigarettes as cessation aids.
Whether E-cigarette use is associated with the use of evidence-based methods is unknown, particularly among American Indian/Alaska Native individuals.
