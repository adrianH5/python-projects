Physical forces exerted by expanding brain tumors - specifically the compressive stresses propagated through solid tissue structures - reduce brain perfusion and neurological function, but heretofore has not been directly measured in patients in vivo.
Solid stress levels estimated from tumor growth patterns are negatively correlated with neurological performance in patients.
We hypothesize that measurements of solid stress can be used to inform clinical management of brain tumors.
