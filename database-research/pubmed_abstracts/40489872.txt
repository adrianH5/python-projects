Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in females.
In low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, reported incidence and prevalence remain unreliable.
The aim was to evaluate Pakistani women's knowledge, attitude, and perception of breast cancer.
This cross-sectional study was conducted among Pakistani women from Punjab, Pakistan.
A self-administered online questionnaire was formulated to collect data from the participants from September 24, 2022, to October 24, 2022.
The questionnaire included sociodemographic data, knowledge questions regarding breast cancer risk factors, knowledge questions about symptoms of breast cancer, and questions assessing the participants' attitudes toward mammography screening.
For knowledge questions, a score of more than 7 out of 13 was considered good knowledge.
For attitude questions, regression analysis was done and a score of more than 5 out of 11 was considered a positive attitude.
Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25 (Chicago).
796 women participated in this study.
Out of 796 participants, 543 (68.2%) were between 20 and 30 years of age, and 43 (5.4%) were more than 40 years old.
The level of knowledge regarding breast cancer risk factors was suboptimal.
523 (65.7%) of the participants thought that breast cancer risk increases with advancing age and 218 (27.4%) thought that early menarche increases the risk of developing breast cancer.
471 (59.2%) mentioned that mammography is an effective tool for detecting breast cancer, and 30 (3.8%) thought that there is a cure for breast cancer.
According to regression analysis, higher education, higher monthly household income, and married marital status were significantly associated with good knowledge related to breast cancer.
Although most of the population is aware of breast cancer's risk factors and symptoms, they avoid screening such as mammography.
Public awareness projects could help increase women's knowledge of breast cancer signs, symptoms, and screening.
