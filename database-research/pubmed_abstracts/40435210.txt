Follicular lymphoma (FL) patients have achieved favorable long-term survival since the introduction of rituximab.
However, the development of second primary malignancies (SPMs) indicates a poor survival prognosis for FL patients, and large-scale studies in this field remain limited.
This study investigates the prognostic factors for FL patients in the rituximab era, as well as the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and prognosis for patients who developed SPMs.
