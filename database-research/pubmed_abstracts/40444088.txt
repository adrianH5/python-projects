Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder caused by the reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22.
This genetic abnormality leads to the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid lineage cells, ultimately causing leukaemia.
Inflammation plays a significant role in the progression of various cancers, including lungs, colorectal, breast, head and neck, and haematological malignancies.
Prostaglandins, which are key mediators in these processes, are synthesised by cyclooxygenases.
Consequently, these genes are critical targets for studying CML due to their involvement in leukemogenesis.
