Cadmium (Cd) exposure through the respiratory system is associated with various respiratory disorders, including lung cancer.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are increasingly recognized as critical regulators in carcinogenesis.
This study employed high-throughput RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in 16HBE cells (Cd-T) after 30 weeks of cadmium chloride (CdCl
