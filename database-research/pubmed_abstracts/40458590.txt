Skin tattoos represent the standard for surface alignment and setup of breast cancer radiotherapy yet contribute to adverse cosmesis and patient dissatisfaction.
With the advent of contemporary surface imaging technology, we evaluated setup accuracy, time, and dosimetric parameters between traditional tattoo-based setup techniques and a "tattoo-less" approach for lymph node positive and high-risk breast cancer patients requiring chest wall and regional nodal radiation.Material/MethodsPatients receiving chest wall radiation for breast cancer underwent a traditional tattoo-based setup (TTB), alternating daily with a tattoo-less setup via surface imaging using AlignRT (ART) to serve as an internal control.
Following initial setup (using tattoos or AlignRT), target position was verified by daily kV imaging, with matching on the chest wall bony anatomy representing ground truth.
Translational (TS) and rotational shifts (RS) were ascertained, as were setup time and total in-room time.
Delivered dosimetry was calculated using the reverse isocenter shift technique.
Statistical analyses used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and Pitman-Morgan variance test.
