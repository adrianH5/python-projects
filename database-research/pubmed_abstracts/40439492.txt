Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures have been guided by the "10% rule," which stipulates that any lymph node (LN) with gamma probe activity (GPA) measured at 10% of the most radioactive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) should be excised.
We hypothesized that it would be unusual for a SLN with less than 20% GPA to harbor the only nodal metastasis in a patient.
