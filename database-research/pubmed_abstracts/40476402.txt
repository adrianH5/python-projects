PERSPECTIVES IN ONCOLOGICAL MEDICAL IMAGING.
Recent advances in medical imaging are transforming the screening and management of the most common cancers, such as breast, prostate, lung and colorectal, as well as rarer cancers such as liver and kidney cancer.
Techniques such as mammography, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), low-dose CT scans and virtual colonoscopy enable early detection, reducing mortality and improving therapeutic outcomes.
These tools are now reinforced by major technological innovations, including artificial intelligence and specific tracers, which optimize diagnostic accuracy while limiting false positives and overdiagnosis.
Furthermore, interventional radiology not only enables the minimally invasive treatment of small tumors, but also the management of cancer-related symptoms.
