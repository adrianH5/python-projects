Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the oral cavity, with chemoresistance is the greatest challenge in chemotherapeutic treatment.
Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) is correlated with tumor malignancy and chemoresistance in various cancers, but its role in OSCC paclitaxel (PTX) resistance remains elusive.
This study aimed to clarify STC1's impact on OSCC PTX resistance and elucidate its underlying mechanism.
