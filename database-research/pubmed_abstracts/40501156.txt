The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) supplies blood to the distal transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.
A thorough understanding of IMA anatomy is crucial in colon cancer surgeries and emerging percutaneous interventions.
However, there is limited research on its precise morphometry, including vessel length, diameters, and branching angles.
This study aims to provide a detailed analysis of the IMA focusing on parameters essential for optimizing percutaneous vascular treatments and colon surgeries.
