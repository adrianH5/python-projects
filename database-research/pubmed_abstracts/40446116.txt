Vachellia farnesiana is a medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds, long used in traditional medicine.
Its therapeutic potential includes addressing cancer, diabetes, and antibiotic-resistant infections, making it a promising candidate for drug discovery.
This study focused on isolating active compounds from the n-hexane and dichloromethane (DCM) fractions of the plant's ethanolic extract employing size exclusion chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
It also aimed to assess their potential antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and cytotoxic activities while validating traditional uses through experimental and computational approaches.
The biological activities of these compounds were tested through cytotoxicity and antimicrobial assays, glucose-lowering experiments in mice, and molecular docking to simulate interactions with disease-related proteins.
Five compounds were isolated, including β-amyrin, 7β-hydroxysitosterol, oleanolic acid, lauric acid, and viscic acid.
Notable findings include high cytotoxicity (LC
