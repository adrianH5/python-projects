Iriscope, a 1.3â€‰mm video endoscopic probe introduced through an r-EBUS catheter, allows for the direct visualisation of small peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPNs).
This study assessed the ability of physicians with different levels of experience in bronchoscopy, and the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the malignant nature of small PPNs during Iriscope peripheral endoscopy.
