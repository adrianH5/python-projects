Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is marked by uncontrolled growth of malignant cells in the bone marrow, presenting a major challenge in hematology despite treatment advances.
Curcumin, a polyphenol from turmeric, shows promise as an anticancer agent with multiple mechanisms targeting pathways like NF-ÎºB, STAT3, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK.
This review highlights curcumin's antileukemic effects, including apoptosis induction, cell proliferation inhibition, and angiogenesis modulation.
Although low bioavailability limits its clinical use, nanoformulations such as liposomes and micelles have improved curcumin's stability and uptake.
Combining curcumin with standard chemotherapies has shown synergistic effects, enhancing anticancer efficacy.
Preclinical studies consistently demonstrate curcumin's antileukemic impact in AML cell lines and animal models, showing reduced tumor load and prolonged survival.
Ongoing clinical trials are assessing curcumin's safety and efficacy in AML patients, with early results indicating potential.
However, larger randomized trials are needed for confirmation.
In conclusion, curcumin's anticancer properties and safety profile make it a valuable candidate for AML treatment.
Further research is necessary to refine delivery methods, optimize combination therapies, and substantiate its role through clinical trials.
