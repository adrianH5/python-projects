Oral delivery is the most preferred route for nutraceuticals due to its convenience and high patient compliance.
However, bioavailability is often compromised by poor solubility, instability, and first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract.
This review examines current and emerging oral delivery platforms designed to overcome these barriers and enhance nutraceutical efficacy.
Traditional carriers-proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates-highlighting their delivery mechanisms and limitations, are first explored.
Advancements in material science have led to novel platforms such as biodegradable polymers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), metal-polyphenol networks (MPNs), and 3D printing technologies.
Biodegradable polymers improve stability and enable controlled release of bioactives.
MOFs offer high surface area and tunable porosity for encapsulating and protecting sensitive compounds.
MPNs provide biocompatible, stimuli-responsive systems for targeted nutrient delivery.
Meanwhile, 3D printing facilitates the fabrication of personalized delivery systems with precise control over composition and release kinetics, especially when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) for precision nutrition.
By comparing traditional and next-generation strategies, this review outlines key design principles for optimizing oral delivery systems.
The transformative potential of these innovations is underscored to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic outcomes of nutraceuticals, ultimately advancing personalized and targeted nutrition solutions.
