IMPACTS OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS ON THE PLACENTA.
The placenta is a transitional organ that plays a major role during pregnancy, providing the vital functions required for the development of the fetus.
However, its development and functions are still poorly understood.
Exposure of pregnant women to chemical substances such as endocrine disruptors (ED) significantly impacts the placental development and disrupts its functioning.
The impact of EDs on the placenta is primarily reflected in the increased occurrence of pregnancy complications, negatively influences the development of the fetus and contributes to the onset of chronic pathologies in childhood (asthma, obesity, IHD, ADHD, etc.)
and adulthood (hormone-dependent cancers, diabetes, etc.).
Recent data from studies carried out in vitro, in vivo, in experimental models or through epidemiological studies have enabled to better characterize the molecular pathways impacted, the physiological processes altered, and the consequences of exposure to EDs on the placenta.
