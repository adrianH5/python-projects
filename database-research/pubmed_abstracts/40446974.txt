Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide and a major cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer.
The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of H. pylori play crucial roles in its pathogenesis, acting as key mediators of bacterial adhesion, immune evasion, and interactions with the host.
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the various OMPs involved in H. pylori pathogenesis, including their roles as adhesins, porins, and in biofilm formation.
Additionally, this review explores the involvement of OMPs in triggering proinflammatory responses that contribute to the development and progression of severe gastric diseases.
By summarizing the current knowledge on H. pylori OMPs, this review highlights their significance as potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing or mitigating H. pylori-associated diseases.
