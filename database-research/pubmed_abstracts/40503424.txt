Single fraction preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has historically used a 10% to 20% dose reduction standard dosing.
However, the effects of this dose reduction are not well characterized.
The goal of this study was to compare outcomes and toxicity of standard dose (SD) with reduced dose (RD) single fraction preoperative SRS.
