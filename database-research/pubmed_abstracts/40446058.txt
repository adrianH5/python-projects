Over the last 30 years, axillary surgery in patients with breast cancer has undergone a consistent patient-centered, evidence-based de-escalation of surgical intervention, including considerable practice changes over the last decade.
As surgical approaches change, the role of breast imaging radiologists and axillary imaging must also evolve.
Axillary imaging remains variable across radiology practices, with implementation of new protocols occurring at various speeds.
Breast radiologists must be aware of recent trials and remain agile in adopting or responding to changing treatment paradigms.
Breakthrough studies, such as the SOUND (Sentinel Node Vs Observation After Axillary Ultra-souND) trial, must be vetted and evaluated by individual practices before adoption.
Breast radiologists should play a key role in multidisciplinary collaboration with colleagues involved in breast cancer care to assist with strategic planning and appropriate resource utilization.
