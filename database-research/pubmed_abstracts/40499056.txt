Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in Mozambique and is a major health burden.
Surgery for cervical cancer is currently performed at only one hospital in the country, Maputo Central Hospital.
Before 2020, there were no gynecologists in Mozambique trained to care for women with cervical cancer.
In 2017, the International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS) started a gynecologic oncology training program in Mozambique, and in 2020, the first three fellows graduated from this program.
The main objective of this study was to report the outcomes of patients with cervical cancer who were treated surgically by the three newly trained Mozambican gynecologic oncologists.
