Obliteration of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with radiosurgery is challenging because high radiation doses prescribed for better effectiveness can increase procedural risks.
To minimize adverse effects, fractionation protocols ensure delivery of equivalent or higher total radiation in manageable doses.
Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (HF-SRS), a fractionation strategy using doses exceeding 2 Gy per fraction, requires fewer treatment sessions.
The authors conducted a systematic literature review to meta-analyze potential benefits of HF-SRS compared with conventional fractionation regimens.
