Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are renewable bionanomaterials with great utilization potential in future biomedicals.
However, conventional CNF hydrogels are limited by low structural flexibility and insufficiently tunable mechanical properties, restricting their use in 3D cell culture systems.
To address these limitations, we developed granular hydrogel platforms using photocurable and ionically crosslinkable methacrylated CNFs (CNFMAs) and their copolymers with polyacrylamide
