Mutations in TP53 are associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
In this study, we investigated the relationship between TP53 mutations and lipid metabolism abnormalities caused by sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1).
We hypothesized that SOAT1 inhibitors would show high efficacy in patients with PDAC with TP53 mutations.
