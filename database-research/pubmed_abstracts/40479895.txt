This study focuses on developing highly potent inhibitors targeting peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs), particularly PAD4 and PAD1, which play critical roles in citrullination-linked diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.
A series of benzylamine- and benzimidazole-substituted compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity.
Key findings include the identification of naphthalene and quinoline-based scaffolds with hydroxyl substitutions, which exhibited superior inhibition of PAD1 and PAD4 (IC
