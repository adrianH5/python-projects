Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an increasingly prevalent and deadly disease that is initiated by different etiological factors, such as alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), viral hepatitis, and other hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic agents.
The tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC is characterized by several different fibroblastic and immune cell types, all of which affect the initiation, progression and metastasis of this malignant cancer.
This complex immune TME can be divided into an innate component that includes macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, and innate lymphoid cells, as well as an adaptive component that includes CD4
