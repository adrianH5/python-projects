Approximately 50 % of cancer patients use practices of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
However, some of these methods may interact with oncological medication.
Despite the generally increasing use of CAM in recent years, its prevalence has been studied insufficiently among cancer patients in Germany.
Thus, this study aims to assess the recent use of CAM among cancer patients, evaluate communication on CAM between patients and healthcare providers, and present an overview of the most frequently used practices.
