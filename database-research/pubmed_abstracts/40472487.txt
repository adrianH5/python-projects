Hsp90-Cdc37-kinase cycle plays a critical role in the development of cancers.
And the phosphorylation of Cdc37 (Serine13) by CK2 is a prerequisite.
Celastrol (CEL) can interfere with Hsp90-Cdc37-kinase cycle by inhibiting Hsp90-Cdc37 protein-protein interaction (PPI) to exhibit antitumor effect.
In this study, the pharmacophore of CK2 inhibitors was first introduced to CEL to obtain 18 derivatives to improve the antitumor activity, and the anti-proliferation of the derivatives was evaluated.
Among them, compound 11 exhibited the most potent activity against MDA-MB-231 (IC
