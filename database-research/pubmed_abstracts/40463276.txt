Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have revolutionized spatiotemporal observations in biology.
Yet, the design of multiplexed assays remains constrained by limited spectral characterization and palette validation.
Although over 1,000 FPs have been catalogued, systematic resources for characterizing their use in multiplexed approaches are lacking.
Here we present a resource and methodology for selecting and decoding FPs in multiplexed imaging experiments.
A library of forty-four FPs was built for rapid assembly into mammalian expression vectors and transposase-mediated integration.
Hyperspectral imaging was performed for each FP and spectral space was characterized mathematically.
To support experimental design and data interpretation, we developed the Cosine Similarity Decoder of XFP (
