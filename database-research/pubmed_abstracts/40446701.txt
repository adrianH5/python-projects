Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are manifested by proximal muscle weakness, inflammation, and elevation of muscle enzymes.
Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a form of IIM often associated with anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (anti-HMGCR) antibodies.
Recently, certain regional populations have been found to have increased anti-HMGCR antibody IMNM.
The present study compared the epidemiology of IIM and IMNM in the adult Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasians in the Southwestern USA.
