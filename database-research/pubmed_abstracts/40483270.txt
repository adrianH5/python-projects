Understanding the dynamics of the tumor-immune ecosystem is crucial for advancing neoadjuvant strategies in cancer treatment.
This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Thirty patients underwent combination therapy.
Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment.
Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles.
Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed.
Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45
