BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with vascular invasion at advanced stage is not indicated for surgical options.
Conversion therapy is used for unresectable HCC to downstage.
Chemotherapy can be more precisely targeted to HCC by using hepatic artery infusion.
Bevacizumab and sintilimab are available systemic therapies for HCC.
This report describes a 50-year-old man with advanced HCC associated with multiple venous tumor thromboses treated with hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with bevacizumab and sintilimab conversion therapy.
CASE REPORT A 50-year-old man was admitted to the hospital due to elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in July 2022.
Abdominal computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a large HCC with multiple venous tumor thromboses.
Pulmonary CTA detected arterial embolism and multiple solid nodules.
He received HAIC combined with bevacizumab and sintilimab every 3 weeks, and achieved partial response after 3 cycles.
However, in March 2023, levels of AFP and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) were re-elevated, showing some pulmonary nodules were enlarged, which was confirmed as pulmonary metastases by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).
Subsequently, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with bevacizumab and sintilimab was performed, and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was used to treat pulmonary metastases.
Skull metastasis appeared in March 2024, requiring further local radiotherapy.
Despite this, the patient has survived for over 26 months, with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 8 months.
CONCLUSIONS HAIC combined with bevacizumab and sintilimab can alleviate primary HCC and tumor thromboses, and further local radiotherapy can control the progression of distant metastases, prolonging the survival time of patients with advanced HCC.
