Sino-nasal mucosal melanoma (SN-MM) is an aggressive and rare form of melanoma arising from mucosal melanocytes with pathogenesis unrelated to sun exposure.
Conversely to cutaneous melanoma (CM), the molecular bases underling SN-MM development and progression are unclear, and no molecular predictive markers have been identified yet.
To better define the molecular landscape of SN-MM, a retrospective series of 37 SN-MMs from 31 patients was analysed for both somatic mutations and cytogenetic alterations.
The somatic mutation analysis identified the presence of a driver gene pathogenic variant in 54% of cases.
