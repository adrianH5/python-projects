Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is an oncogene that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53.
By binding to p53, MDM2 promotes its degradation, thus promoting the malignant proliferation.
The MDM2-p53 interaction has thus generated interest as a therapeutic target, particularly in some sarcomas characterized by the amplification of the MDM2 gene.
In this manuscript, we provide an overview of the current and emerging targeted therapies for MDM2-amplified sarcomas.
