Breast cancer (BC) can be categorized into 4 groups based on molecular and pathological evidence: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+ tumors, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
TNBC has a poorer survival rate and a higher chance of recurrence and metastasis compared to other BC types, primarily due to its challenging treatment course.
Claudin 4 (CLDN4), a transmembrane protein in tight junctions between cells, has been linked to poor prognosis and faster disease progression in these malignancies.
