This study evaluated the educational impact of dental seminars involving practicing pharmacists and dentists on pharmacy students.
Its primary objective was to assess changes in learning attitudes and improvements in oral care knowledge through lectures and group discussions.
The dental seminars were conducted during October-November 2024, and participants included 14â€‰second-year pharmacy students.
Participants completed surveys before and after the seminars that addressed topics such as "antibiotics in dental care" and "pharmacist-dentist collaboration."
Survey results indicated that the proportion of students recognizing the relationship between pharmacy and dentistry increased from 71.5 to 100%.
Furthermore, the percentage of students who expressed a desire to learn more about dentistry increased from 42.9 to 85.7%.
Knowledge assessments revealed significant improvements in the understanding of appropriate use of antibiotics for tooth extraction and oral care during cancer therapy.
However, no improvement was observed in foundational knowledge of dental anatomy, underscoring the necessity of reinforcing basic education.
This study provided preliminary insights into the effectiveness of incorporating dental education into the pharmacy curricula.
These findings can contribute to the development and refinement of educational programs at other universities and institutions.
