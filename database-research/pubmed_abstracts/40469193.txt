Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma, affecting children and adolescents, with poor prognosis in some patient groups.
Better therapeutic regimens and preclinical models to test them in are needed.
Multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MRTKIs) are licensed for adult indications and explored in the clinic in sarcoma patients.
The MRTKI Regorafenib is currently assessed in the relapse setting in patients with RMS (NCT04625907).
Reliable biomarkers of response for MRTKIs are lacking.
MRTKIs act not only against the cancer cell, but also the supporting stroma, particularly the vasculature.
The embryonic zebrafish is translucent and allows assessment of this interaction with high-throughput
