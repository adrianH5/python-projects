Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery is increasingly recognized for its utility in complex pulmonary resections, offering enhanced dexterity, superior 3-dimensional visualization and precise, 'tremor-free' tissue manipulation.
Compared to open thoracotomy, minimally invasive robotic techniques are associated with reduced perioperative morbidity, shorter hospital stays and faster recovery.
Sublobar lung resections, however, remain technically demanding, especially in the deep anatomical segments such as S8.
Three-dimensional reconstructive imaging provides detailed preoperative visualization of the pulmonary anatomy, allowing for precise surgical planning and identification of individual bronchovascular structures.
Despite its advantages, the integration of virtual 3-dimensional imaging into routine thoracic practice remains limited and under-reported in the literature.
This video tutorial contributes to a growing video atlas series on robotic segmentectomy guided by high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction.
We demonstrate a robotic-assisted left S8 segmentectomy for a deep pulmonary metastasis, where three-dimensional reconstruction enabled identification of an alternative, 'parenchyma-sparing' approach via the inferior pulmonary vein.
This video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide, from port placement to segmental dissection and resection, illustrating how advanced imaging technologies can enhance anatomical precision and optimize outcomes in robotic segmental lung surgery.
