Loss of all or part of chromosome 7 [-7/del(7q)] is recurrent in myeloid neoplasms and associated with a poor response to chemotherapy.
Chromosome 7-encoded genes driving drug resistance and the consequences of combinatorial 7q tumor suppressor gene loss have remained unclear, the latter question largely because of the challenges of modeling aneuploidy.
Here, we use in silico data mining to uncover 7q genes involved in chemotherapy resistance.
We establish murine models of del(7q) clonal hematopoiesis and drug resistance with multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)-mediated inactivation of 4 genes,
