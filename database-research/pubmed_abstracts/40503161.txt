We report a rare case of late parotid metastasis from undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) occurring 10 years post-chemoradiotherapy.
Despite negative EBV status, negative biopsies and inconclusive cytology, histopathology confirmed recurrence.
The case underscores the challenging diagnosis of post-treatment NPC late metastases and emphasizes the need for vigilance in similar cases.
