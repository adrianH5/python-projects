The majority of patients with melanoma develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and over half do not respond to anti-PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immunotherapy.
Accurate predictive biomarkers for both response to therapy and development of irAEs are currently lacking in clinical practice.
Here, we conduct deep immunophenotyping of circulating regulatory and class-switched B cell and antibody immune states in patients with advanced stage III/IV melanoma prior to and longitudinally during CPI.
