Despite advances in cancer treatment, chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of clinical practice.
However, its efficacy is often compromised by dose-limiting haematologic toxicities.
Recent strategies aim to enhance chemotherapy tolerability while preserving its effectiveness.
One emerging approach involves selective CDK4 inhibitors to serve as myeloid-protective agents in retinoblastoma (RB)-negative tumours, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
Because bone marrow (BM) cells rely on RB for proliferation, CDK4 inhibitors may protect these cells while sparing RB-deficient tumour cells.
The present study investigated the potential of AU2-94, a first-in-class CDK4 inhibitor, to protect BM cells during myelosuppressive chemotherapy in TNBC, beyond its established application in RB-positive cancers.
