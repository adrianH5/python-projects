Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype with a poor prognosis and lacks effective targeted therapies.
Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3(STEAP3) is specifically overexpressed in TNBC, but its precise role and molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
Here, we show that STEAP3 is positively correlated with proliferation markers in TNBC, but not in non-TNBC.
Further assays revealed that STEAP3 significantly enhances TNBC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis
