Polymorphous adenocarcinoma (PAC) is an uncommon salivary gland tumor demonstrating morphologic diversity, including conventional trabecular/tubular/reticular/single filing, cribriform/solid (CASG), and papillary (TPAP) patterns, with differing molecular alterations and biologic behavior.
However, similar to other salivary gland tumors, whether a grading system incorporating mitotic count and necrosis could be applied to PACs is unclear.
Retrospective histologic evaluation was performed on a bi-institutional cohort of 154 PACs, and a two-tiered low-grade/high-grade system, incorporating mitoses â‰¥5 per 2 mm
