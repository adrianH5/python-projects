Gait alterations are recognized as early markers of age-related decline and cognitive impairment.
Dual-task assessments, which impose cognitive load while walking, provide valuable insights into gait control limitations and cognitive-motor interactions in aging populations.
This study evaluates age-related and cognitive load-induced changes in gait parameters, with a particular focus on asymmetry, and aims to optimize the gait assessment protocol for the Semmelweis Study framework.
The Semmelweis Study is a large-scale workplace cohort investigating the determinants of unhealthy aging and promoting healthy brain aging by identifying risk factors and protective mechanisms influencing vascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive decline.
As part of this initiative, gait analysis is emerging as a critical tool for assessing functional aging, detecting early signs of mobility and cognitive impairment, and contributing to biological age assessment.
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on adults aged 23 to 87 years using a pressure-sensitive walkway system.
Participants were evaluated under single-task conditions (normal walking) and dual-task conditions (walking while performing a concurrent cognitive task).
Spatiotemporal gait parameters, asymmetry indices, and dual-task costs were analyzed to assess age-related changes in gait performance and cognitive-motor interactions.
Aging was associated with significant reductions in gait speed, step length, and stride length, along with a corresponding increase in gait asymmetry.
Dual-task conditions exacerbated these alterations, indicating age-related impairments in cognitive-motor integration.
Asymmetry indices were sensitive to aging effects, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for functional decline.
The dual-task cost on gait was significantly greater in older adults, reinforcing the interplay between cognitive and motor systems in aging.
Age-related gait alterations, particularly under cognitive load, underscore the importance of comprehensive gait assessments in aging research.
Our findings contribute to the optimization of the Semmelweis Study gait assessment protocol by identifying key gait parameters that capture functional decline and biological aging.
Integrating dual-task gait analysis into large-scale epidemiological studies has the potential to enhance early detection of brain health decline, refine biological age estimation, and guide targeted interventions to support healthy aging and neuromotor resilience.
