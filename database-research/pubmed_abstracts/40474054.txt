Preoperative non-invasive prediction of the World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology (WHO/ISUP) nuclear grade of small clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) can aid in decision making for active surveillance.
The study aimed to develop and validate a CT algorithm for the prediction of the WHO/ISUP nuclear grade of small (2-4Â cm) solid ccRCC.
