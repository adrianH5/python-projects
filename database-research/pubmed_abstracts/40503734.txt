Ferroptosis, a form of programmed iron-dependent cell death, is associated with various liver pathologies.
Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the crucial role of ferroptosis in liver function.
This study aimed to explore the development of ferroptosis in liver diseases through bibliometric analysis.
We retrieved the data from the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection, then imported selected articles into VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Microsoft Excel for knowledge mapping analysis.
A total of 1,236 articles were included in this study, showing a steady increase in publications on ferroptosis in the liver over the past 11 years, with a significant surge in recent years.
China emerged as a dominant contributor, accounting for 86% of global publications.
Key institutions included Zhejiang University and Sun Yat-sen University.
Zhang Feng from Nanjing Medical University was identified as the most prolific author.
