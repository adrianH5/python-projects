Aflatoxin contamination poses a significant public health risk in The Gambia due to its prevalence in staple crops and its association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
This study assessed aflatoxin levels in maize, groundnuts, rice, and millet, and evaluated dietary exposure and liver cancer risks in the Gambian population.
Aflatoxin quantification using HPLC-FLD revealed high contamination levels, particularly in groundnuts (57.5 ± 6.8 µg/kg) and maize (29.7 ± 4.2 µg/kg).
Dietary exposure assessment showed that children aged 1-6 years had the highest exposure, with groundnuts contributing 350.0 ng/kg/day and maize 146.4 ng/kg/day.
Margin of Exposure (MOE) values were critically low, indicating severe health risks.
The estimated liver cancer risk for HBV-positive individuals was highest in children (29 cases per 100,000 from groundnuts and 12 cases per 100,000 from maize), with significant risks also observed in adults.
These findings highlight the urgent need for aflatoxin mitigation strategies.
Recommendations include improved pre- and post-harvest handling, investment in better storage facilities, and enforcement of regulatory limits, public health awareness campaigns, and continuous monitoring.
Implementing these strategies will help reduce aflatoxin exposure and associated health risks in the Gambia.
