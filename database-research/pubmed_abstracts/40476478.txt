The interaction between Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) in modulating autophagy to influence inflammation and tumorigenesis is not fully understood.
This research seeks to clarify the regulatory role of HBx in hepatocyte autophagy through SREBP2.
