Ion channel activity underlying biological processes that drive high-grade gliomas (HGG) is largely unknown.
We aimed to determine the networking of ion channel genes and validate their expression within HGG patient tumors, to identify ion channel-targeting drugs that would inhibit tumor-promoting processes.
