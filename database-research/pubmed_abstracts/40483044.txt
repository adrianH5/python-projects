Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is one of the standard treatments for light chain (AL) amyloidosis, and the mobilization of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell (PBHSC) is crucial for transplantation.
Plerixafor has been shown to promote stem cell mobilization.
The retrospective study included 56 patients who underwent ASCT.
Twenty-eight patients received G-CSF combined with plerixafor (G+P), and the other 28 patients received G-CSF based stem cell mobilization (G).
All patients finally achieved the minimum collection requirements, but there was no statistical difference in the total CD34 + cells yield between the two groups (p = 0.74).
The number of patients achieving the minimum goal, peripheral blood CD34 + cells count, product CD34 + cells count, and CD34 + cells yield of the first apheresis day were higher in the group G+P compared with the group G (28 vs 21, p = 0.02; 106 cells/μL vs 38 cells/μL, p < 0.01; 1880 cells/μL vs 936 cells/μL, p < 0.01; 5.6 × 10
