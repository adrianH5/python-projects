Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor.
Survival rates vary widely between subgroups, with an average overall survival of 70%.
Recurrent medulloblastoma is highly aggressive, treatment-resistant, and usually fatal.
In addition, current treatments are highly toxic to the developing brain and surviving patients suffer from lifelong side effects.
Therefore, novel therapeutic options are urgently needed.
