High-risk Endometrial Cancer (EC) treatment decisions have been informed by two large, randomized trials: GOG-258 and PORTEC-3.
Directly comparing these studies to determine the optimal treatment strategy remains challenging as neither included all three arms of interest: chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy combined with radiation, and radiation therapy alone.
This study addresses this gap by analyzing National Cancer Database (NCDB) data to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, and radiation therapy alone.
