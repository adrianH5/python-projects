Cancer stem cells (CSCs) drive tumor initiation, relapse, and metastasis.
Our research team developed polycaprolactone electrospun (PCL-ES) scaffolds for enriching lung CSCs (LCSCs) since monolayer culture do not allow the study of this malignant population.
The upregulation of fatty acid synthase (FASN) correlates with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and its inhibition induces cytotoxicity in EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.
Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the role of FASN and related signaling pathways in LCSCs cultured in PCL-ES scaffolds and to evaluate the effectiveness of FASN inhibitor G28, a synthetic derivative of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), against this population.
