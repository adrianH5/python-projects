Research indicates that breast pain as the sole symptom has no association with breast cancer.
However, patients with breast pain only are often referred onto urgent breast cancer diagnostic pathways, leading to unnecessary anxiety and overutilisation of secondary health care services.
The novel community breast pain clinic (CBPC) service in the UK aims to improve patient care while providing system-wide improvements for patients with breast pain, patients who have 'red flag' symptoms, as well as being cost-effective.
