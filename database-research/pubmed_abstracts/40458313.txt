Medication nonadherence significantly contributes to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare costs, particularly in chronic diseases like hypertension.
Community Health Workers (CHWs) are well-positioned to address adherence barriers but often lack specific training in medication management and particularly in improving medication adherence.
The objective of this study is to evaluate a training program for CHWs focused on medication adherence support for patients with hypertension.
