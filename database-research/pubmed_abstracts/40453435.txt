The interpretation of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans can be confounded by incidental findings, as illustrated in this case of a 47-year-old woman with a history of breast carcinoma.
Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy, she underwent FDG PET/CT for disease evaluation, revealing unexpected hypermetabolic activity in the right iliac fossa corresponding to acute appendicitis.
Thus, FDG PET/CT has the potential to uncover treatable conditions beyond cancer and imaging findings need clinical correlation.
