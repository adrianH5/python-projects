In this study, we successfully designed and developed novel hybrid compounds integrating thiazole and pyrazole pharmacophores through a molecular hybridization approach.
The synthesis was carried out through the Vilsmeier-Haack reaction, and the structural elucidation of these hybrids was achieved using FTIR,
