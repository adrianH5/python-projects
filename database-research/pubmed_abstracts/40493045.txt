With increasing use of human epithelial growth factor receptor two (HER2)-targeted therapies, outcomes for numerous breast cancer patients have improved.
Nevertheless, patients with HER2-positive tumours face a comparatively heightened risk for developing brain metastases (BM), which are often treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
Radionecrosis represents one of the clinically most significant adverse events of SRS.
However, a knowledge gap remains regarding the effects of concurrent use of HER2-targeted therapies with SRS on development of radionecrosis, given conflicting findings in existing studies.
