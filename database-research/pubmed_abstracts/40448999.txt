Mature tRNAs and rRNAs are derived from larger precursor transcripts through intricate endo- and exonuclease processing steps.
Here, we present a protocol to analyze rRNA and tRNA processing using total RNA extracted from human cells.
We describe steps for separating RNA by denaturing electrophoresis, followed by northern blotting.
We detail procedures for detecting pre-rRNA intermediates or specific tRNA species using biotin-labeled probes imaged via fluorescence or chemiluminescence.
This non-radioactive, high-sensitivity assay enables the investigation of rRNA and tRNA expression dynamics.
For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Hwang et al.
