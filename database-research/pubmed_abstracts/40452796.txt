This study investigates the chemopreventive potential of a grape pomace extract (GPE) derived from Verdicchio grapes, aligning with circular economy principles to repurpose winery waste into a nutraceutical targeting gastric cancer prevention.
Soxhlet extraction yielded a bioactive-rich extract.
Comprehensive chemical characterization via HPLC/ESI/Q-TOF identified 39 metabolites spanning key chemical classes.
Anthocyanins were predominant, with malvidin glucoside (12,546 mg/kg DM; 36.3%), malvidin coumaroyl glucoside (9941 mg/kg DM; 28.8%), and malvidin acetylglucoside (7189 mg/kg DM; 20.8%) as the most abundant compounds.
Carboxylic acids included tartaric, malic, isocitric, aconitic, and succinic acids, while lipid molecules, such as phytosphingosine and stearic acid, and amino acids like proline, valine, leucine, and phenylalanine further enriched the extract's chemical heterogeneity.
Biological evaluations revealed GPE's selective cytotoxicity against AGS (IC
