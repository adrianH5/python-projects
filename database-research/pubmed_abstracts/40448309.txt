The parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system has shown tumor-suppressive effects in preclinical models of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by inhibiting cancer stem cells and suppressing inflammatory cytokine production.
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that bethanechol, an FDA-approved parasympathomimetic agent targeting muscarinic receptors, could enhance treatment efficacy in PDAC.
