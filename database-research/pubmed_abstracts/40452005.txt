Metastatic tumor cells that escape from immune surveillance are a dilemma in cancer treatment, and thus developing selective targeting agents to treat metastatic tumor and reinstate immune perception is imperative for clinical applications.
Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform of supramolecular assembled nanoparticles (SANs) comprising a core structure of metal ion (Fe
