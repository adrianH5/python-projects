Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Over the years, significant progress has been made in diagnosing and treating MASLD.
However, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis exploring the relationship between MASLD and HCC.
This study aims to comprehensively analyze the knowledge structure and research status of MASLD-related HCC using bibliometric methods.
