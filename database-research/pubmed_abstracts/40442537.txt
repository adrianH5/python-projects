Pituitary metastases (PM) account for 0.4% of all intracranial metastases and typically present with visual and endocrinological deficits.
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has shown excellent tumor control and safety profile in the management of intracranial metastases.
However, its role and safety in managing metastases to the pituitary gland are not well-characterized.
This study aims to evaluate SRS outcomes and safety profile in the management of PM in a multicenter international cohort.
