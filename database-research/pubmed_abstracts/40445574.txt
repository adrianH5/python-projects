Our study aims to target Met and EpCAM to inhibit angiogenesis in breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
We have developed a new bispecific antibody that targets both MET and EpCAM, which are commonly overexpressed in tumor cells.
This antibody aims to reduce tumor cell proliferation and spread.
After cloning and expressing the anti-Met/EPCAM sequence in Escherichia coli, we confirmed its accuracy through Western blot analysis.
Flow cytometry indicated its binding activities to MET and EPCAM on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines.
Our antibody showed anti-proliferative potential as indicated by apoptosis and MTT assay, leading to the inhibition of migration and invasion in breast cancer cell lines.
After conducting a thorough analysis of cytokine production, we discovered that our bispecific antibody effectively influenced the levels of IL-8 and IL-6.
These cytokines play crucial roles in angiogenesis and the progression of breast cancer.
These findings indicate that our bispecific antibody holds promise as a potential therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.
It has the potential to impede the formation of new blood vessels in tumors, thus restraining their growth and spread.
