Radiolabeling is a technique that involves attaching radioactive isotopes to molecules, allowing for their tracking and analysis in biological systems.
Radiolabeled D-glucose and its derivatives have a very prominent role in exploring metabolic pathways, the enzymatic system, and measuring the flow of the metabolites through biochemical reactions, as accumulation or deficiency of metabolites occurs along with metabolic disorders.
Glucose as the main source of energy in the body is involved in different metabolic pathways like glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle.
Various derivatives of glucose are labeled at different positions by
