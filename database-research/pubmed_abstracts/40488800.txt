The TGF-β pathway can influence breast cancer progression and therapy efficacy, exhibiting both pro- and anti-tumoral effects.
This study examined the impact of active TGF-β signaling on recurrence and radiotherapy (RT) benefit in early-stage breast cancer, using nuclear phosphorylated Smad2 (pSMAD2) as a marker for pathway activation.
