Medicinal plant-based biocompatible nanomaterials have become increasingly important in the healthcare field.
Zeolitic imidazole (ZIF-8) frameworks are fascinating porous crystalline materials that have great attention in the field of drug delivery due to their biodegradability, pH sensitivity to changes in acidic conditions, and chemical durability.
The development of ZIF-8 particles loaded with
