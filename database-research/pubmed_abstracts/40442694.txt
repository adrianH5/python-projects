Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare, heterogeneous malignancy with limited treatment options for metastatic disease.
Despite advances in immunotherapy, including PD-1 inhibitors, clinical outcomes remain suboptimal, highlighting the need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.
This study investigated the role of TACC2 in STS, focusing on its impact on the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy response.
