Pancreatic cancer is intrinsically characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment, in which the malignant extracellular matrix (ECM) creates a barrier that significantly impedes drug delivery, thereby undermining the overall anti-tumor immune responses.
In this study, we present a novel thermosensitive hydrogel (SCC15+PLHCu@Gel) that co-deliver two types of nanoparticles loaded with the disulfiram derivative CPD12C15 (SCC15) and tumor-targeting Cu
