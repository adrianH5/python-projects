Inflammasomes are essential regulators of innate immunity, inflammation, and cellular apoptosis, and they have surfaced as significant modulators of cancer progression and regulation.
Inflammasomes are macromolecular complexes assembled in response to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
They induce inflammation via the oligomerization and activation of caspases.
These cysteine proteases cleave the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18 into their physiologically active mature versions.
Recent discoveries reveal that inflammasomes are implicated not only in infections but also in malignancies, suggesting a significant connection between inflammation and tumor development.
This article emphasizes that inflammasomes cause pyroptosis in a variety of immune cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, and fibroblasts, in addition to tumor cells.
