Melanoma progression can be effectively modeled through mathematical frameworks, making it a pivotal focus for enhancing our understanding of cancer dynamics and informing personalized treatment strategies.
The present research investigates the growth dynamics of melanoma by analyzing 16 individual melanoma cell lines, utilizing in vivo clinical data that spans a range of metastatic stages from primary melanoma to stage IV.
The study estimates growth rates across these cell lines by implementing a power law model through nonlinear least squares, uncovering distinct mathematical patterns linked to melanoma stages.
Furthermore, the research evaluates the efficacy of various treatment strategies tailored to each disease stage through a chemoimmunotherapy mathematical model.
For primary and early-stage melanoma, where tumors are localized, surgical excision is identified as the most effective intervention, often enhanced by CD4
