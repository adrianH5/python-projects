A high-definition description of pancreatic islets would prove beneficial for understanding the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet significant knowledge voids exist in terms of their size, endocrine cell composition, and number in both health and disease.
Here, 3-dimensional (3D) analyses of pancreata from control persons without diabetes (ND) revealed heretofore underappreciated frequencies (approximately 50%) of insulin-positive (INS+) glucagon-negative (GCG-) islets.
Non-diabetic individuals positive for a single Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA+) yet at increased risk for disease consistently demonstrated endocrine features, including islet volume and cell composition, closely resembling the age-matched ND controls.
In contrast, pancreata from individuals with short-duration T1D demonstrated significantly reduced islet density and a dramatic loss of INS+GCG- islets with preservation of large INS+GCG+ islets.
The size and cellular composition of pancreatic islets may, therefore, represent influential factors that impact Î²-cell loss during T1D disease progression.
