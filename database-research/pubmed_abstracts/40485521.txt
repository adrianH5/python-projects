Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a type of highly malignant tumor associated with poor prognosis, whose progression is driven by hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment.
This study aims to explore the effects of hypoxia-induced upregulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) on the proliferation and stemness of PC cells and its potential molecular mechanism, so as to provide new targets and therapy strategies for the PC.
