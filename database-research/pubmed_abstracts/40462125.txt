In laparoscopic gastrectomy, liver retraction is an important procedure to obtain a sufficient operative view to ensure the quality of surgery.
However, postoperative liver dysfunction is frequently encountered after liver retraction.
This study aims to explore the effect of a modified liver retraction method (MLR) we designed on the postoperative liver function of patients receiving laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.
