Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy, and the global incidence has been steadily increasing over the years.
Although PTC generally exhibits favorable prognosis, a subset of patients experiences aggressive progression and increased mortality.
Current prognostic approaches, reliant on clinic-pathological factors, have limitations, underscoring the need for innovative biomarkers.
MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as promising candidates due to their roles in cellular processes and cancer progression.
Among them, the present study investigated the role of miR-18b in PTC, exploring its potential as a prognostic biomarker.
