Prostate cancer is a prevalent malignancy, and effective biomarkers are needed to improve patient management.
This study aimed to explore the prognostic value and potential functions of POLR2H in prostate cancer.
Prognosis-related genes for prostate cancer were screened through high-throughput functional screening using CRISPR.
qPCR was used to detect POLR2H expression in different prostate cancer cell lines, prostate hyperplasia cell lines, and normal human prostate epithelial cells.
Transwell and scratch assays were conducted to assess cell migration ability.
Cell proliferation ability was evaluated by CCK-8 and colony formation assays.
POLR2H emerged as a gene of interest associated with patient outcomes.
Its expression was found to be elevated in prostate cancer cell lines compared with benign and normal prostate cells.
Functional assays indicated that altering POLR2H levels affected cell migration and proliferation.
Moreover, analysis across patient cohorts suggested an association between POLR2H expression and immune cell infiltration, implying a potential role in immunotherapy response.
These findings support the role of POLR2H as a promising prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer.
