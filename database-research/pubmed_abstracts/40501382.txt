Genome- and epigenome-wide association studies have associated variants and methylation status of CPT1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) to reductions in VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which CPT1a-dependent mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation influences hepatic and lipoprotein metabolism.
