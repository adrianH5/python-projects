Radiation therapy (RT) is a critical part of cancer treatment often accompanied by heightened anxiety, depression, and reduced life satisfaction.
Although psycho-oncological (PO) interventions and social support can alleviate distress, it is unclear whether patients' desire for PO intervention reflects temporary or ongoing distress and whether all patients benefit from social support or only those seeking help.
In this study we examined whether the desire for PO intervention during the start of RT predicted anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction at the start and end of RT and whether perceived social support moderated these effects.
One-hundred-and-forty-six patients completed questionnaires at three time-points (pre-treatment, first treatment, and last treatment).
Results showed that patients desiring PO intervention reported higher anxiety and depression at the start and end of RT.
Higher perceived social support predicted lower depression and improved life satisfaction but only for patients expressing a desire for PO intervention.
Screening for psychological distress is standard in oncology but often limited by time and resources during RT.
The current study findings suggest that a single, straightforward question at the start of RT could identify at-risk patients, enabling proactive intervention.
Moreover, fostering perceptions of social support may help mitigate negative outcomes in the absence of professional intervention.
