Individuals with a family history of cancer face an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.
Up to 30% of the 70,000 annual breast cancer cases in Germany are associated with a familial cancer burden.
Early identification of these risks is crucial as personalised measures can enable early detection or prevention of cancer.
Primary care gynaecologists are uniquely suited to assess family histories and facilitate referrals to hereditary cancer centres.
However, solutions on how to support early referral are still lacking.
This study evaluates the impact of the digital care platform dVP_FAM as a potential remedy compared to standard care.
The primary hypothesis is that the platform will increase the proportion of care-seeking women with a familial cancer risk who have not yet developed cancer.
Secondary outcomes include improvements in care efficiency, patient empowerment, and health-related quality of life.
