The purpose of this study is to explore the role of cancer patient self-efficacy in linking self-perceived burden to end-of-life communication difficulties.
The participants and setting are conveniently selected cancer patients from three hospitals in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, from December 2022 to May 2023 as the study subjects.
Questionnaires were administered using the General Information Questionnaire, Self-Perceived Burden (SPBS), Self-Efficacy Scale (SUPPH), and Difficulties in End-of-Life Discussions-Family Inventory (DEOLD-FI).
The PROCESS 3.4 program was used to analyze the mediating effect of self-efficacy between self-perceived burdens and end-of-life communication disorders.
In cancer patients, self-feeling burden was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r =  - 0.439, P < 0.01) and positively correlated with end-of-life communication difficulties (r = 0.600, P < 0.01).
Self-efficacy was negatively correlated with end-of-life communication difficulties (r =  - 0.608, P < 0.01).
Self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between self-perceived burden and end-of-life communication difficulties, accounting for 31.19% of the total effect.
Cancer patients' self-perceived burden, communication difficulties, and self-efficacy are all moderate.
It is recommended to improve self-efficacy to reduce burden and communication barriers.
It is recommended that medical staff reduce self-perception burden and end-of-life communication barriers by improving patient self-efficacy.
