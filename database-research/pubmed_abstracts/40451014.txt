Targeting the VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway is considered to be an effective strategy for the treatment of cervical cancer, and multidrug resistance in cervical cancer has now been widely demonstrated to be caused by the upregulation of P-gp.
This study designed and synthesized a series of novel licochalcone A derivatives using licochalcone A as the lead compound and VEGFR-2 and P-gp as the action targets.
The principle of active substructure splicing was employed to design and synthesize a series of novel licochalcone A derivatives and to preliminarily evaluate the in vitro and ex vivo anti-cancer active effects of the target compounds.
The results showed that the IC
