Thyroid nodules are frequently encountered in medical practice.
Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used to rule out malignant nodules, but few studies have questioned the accuracy of FNAC in larger thyroid nodules compared to smaller ones.
We, therefore, aim to compare the diagnostic performance of FNAC based on nodule size and whether larger nodule size increases the possibility of obtaining indeterminate or non-diagnostic results.
