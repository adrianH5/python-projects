Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and aggressive pediatric hematologic malignancy characterized by clonal proliferation of myelomonocytic cells.
It predominantly affects young children and presents significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping features with other myeloid disorders.
Here, we report the case of a 2-year-old male patient with unique genetic findings involving the NPM::MLF1 fusion gene and NRAS mutation.
