Atypical glandular cells, favor neoplastic (AGC-FN) identified in Papanicolaou (Pap) smears may be indicative of pre-malignant and malignant cervical and endometrial lesions.

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between AGC-FN and high-grade lesions, as well as identify specific risk factors which can optimize the currently strategy in women with AGC-FN.
