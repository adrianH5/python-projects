Subsequently to the publication of the above paper, an interested reader drew to the authors' attention that, for the cellular morphological images shown in Figs.
3A and 4A on p. 7 and 8 respectively, the centrally placed images (third from the left) were strikingly similar, such that the same data had apparently been included in these figures to show the results from differently performed experiments.
After having re‑examined their original data files, the authors realized that the data panel in Fig.
4A properly belonged to Fig.
3, and that this image had been inadvertently included incorrectly in this figure.
The revised version of Fig.
4, now featuring the correct data for the 'Amit+/TRAIL+/DR5 siRNA‑/NC ‑' experiment (third panel from the left), is shown on the next page.
Note that the correction of this figure does not affect the overall conclusions reported in the paper.
