Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) represents the leading application of robotic surgery in the treatment for prostate cancer with faster recovery and reduced invasiveness.
Maintaining stable blood pressure during RARP is crucial to avoid complications.
The approach used is goal-directed therapy (GDT); however, the Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI), a machine learning algorithm that analyses arterial waveforms, may provide additional benefits.
