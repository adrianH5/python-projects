Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 2-[18F]FDG (FDG) has been increasingly used to detect or monitor neoplasms.
Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is one of the most common sites of FDG uptake, leading to increasing requests for endoscopic examinations.
We aimed to evaluate the nature and significance of unexpected PET/CT-FDG findings in the GIT.
