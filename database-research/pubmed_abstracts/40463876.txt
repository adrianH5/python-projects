Cell-cell crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for cancer development and strongly correlates with clinical outcomes.
Interpatient variability in tumor microenvironment composition and function poses ongoing challenges for personalized therapy selection, remaining a significant clinical problem.
Serpin family E member 2 (SERPINE2) released from the tumor microenvironment exhibits significant regulatory functions in cancer progression but the role of SERPINE2 in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear.
In this study, we want to investigate the potential mechanism of SERPINE2 in tumor microenvironment of colon cancer.
