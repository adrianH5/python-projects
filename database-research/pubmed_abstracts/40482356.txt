Treatment decisions in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a rare life-threatening neurological disease, are challenging.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or autologous stem-cell-based gene therapy can be life-changing but come with uncertainties, risks, and high costs.
To address this, the international MLD treatment eligibility panel was established in collaboration with the European Reference Network on Rare Neurological Diseases.
The panel reviews and discusses individual MLD cases and provides consensus-based recommendations on whether to treat and which treatment modality.
The goal is to streamline international care and treatment counseling by providing uncomplicated access to expert opinion.
