Infraocclusion refers to a tooth located below the occlusal surface compared to adjacent teeth long after it should have reached occlusion.
Ankylosis is frequently associated with the infraocclusion of primary molars, but it is challenging to distinguish between the two conditions.
Surgical luxation and orthodontic traction have been applied for the treatment of ankylosed, infraoccluded permanent teeth, but reports on primary molars are scarce.
