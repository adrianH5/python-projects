The human papillomavirus is a prevalent sexually transmitted disease.
Studies have shown a connection between HPV and malignancies of the cervix, penis, vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx.
Colon cancer ranks 10th among all cancers in Pakistan, with 2.7% incidence and 2.4% mortality, while rectal cancer ranks 16th with 1.8% incidence and 1.5% mortality, according to Globocan 2020 data.
The native Pakistani population has been progressively affected by colorectal cancer in just four years.
The frequency of the disease in males increased threefold, from 2.3 to 6.8%, and in females, from 2.5 to 6.7%.
This study was based on 135 paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens collected from several hospitals in Hazara division, Pakistan.
Predominantly, the samples were Adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectal squamous carcinoma, and adenoma of the colon.
Ten normal biopsy specimens were taken as controls.
After processing and treatment with liquid nitrogen, specimens were tested using the GeneXpert PCR to detect HPV DNA and high-risk genotypes HPV16, HPV18, and HPV45.
No HPV DNA was found in any of the control samples.
85 (62%) of the 135 specimens had HPV DNA identified, while seven specimens were detected with low-risk genotypes HPV6, HPV11, and HPV55.
In the In-silico study, the role of E6 in colorectal cancer development was investigated through pathway analysis.
E6 protein structures were retrieved and visualized in MOE 2015.10.
The structure of P16INK4A was also retrieved from Pdb, and docking was performed between E6 and P16INK4A to generate a docking complex.
