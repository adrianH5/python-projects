Ginsenoside has been developed into numerous functional foods or dietary supplements that are highly beneficial for human health.
This study investigated the anti non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mechanism of ginseng glucosyl oleanolate (GGO), a metabolite of ginsenoside Ro.
In A549 cells, GGO significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration.
Subsequent RNA sequencing analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after GGO treatment predominantly concentrated in the cell cycle and apoptotic process.
The present study has demonstrated that GGO blocks the cellular G2/M phase and induces DNA damage by activating the P53 signaling pathway.
Furthermore, GGO promoted apoptosis in the mitochondrial pathway through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
In A549 cell xenograft nude mice, GGO intervention significantly inhibited tumor growth but had no significant effect on body weight.
The immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot (WB) analyses demonstrated that GGO induced apoptosis and regulated the expression of cell cycle proteins related to the P53 signaling pathway in tumor tissues.
These findings provided new evidence that GGO could potentially suppress A549 cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.
