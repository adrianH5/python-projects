Residual cancer burden (RCB) is a strong prognostic marker after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer (BC), yet some BCs defy their predicted outcomes.
Using single-cell spatial transcriptomics and genomic profiling, we investigate mechanisms underlying divergent fates of BCs with high RCB across subtypes.
In triple-negative BC (TNBC), CXCL9+ macrophage-CD8
