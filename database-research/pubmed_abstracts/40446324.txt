Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections in the United States; however, vaccination uptake falls far below the goal of 80% of the population set forth by Healthy People 2030.
Specifically, within the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning) population, HPV vaccination adherence remains a complex issue.
Due to the widespread use of technology within the young adult population, digital health tools such as digital storytelling (DST) have been promoted as an effective way to increase vaccination uptake.
