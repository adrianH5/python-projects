Postoperative hyperglycemia in diabetic patients is a widely known risk factor for postoperative infectious complications (PICs) after esophagectomy; however, the significance of glycemic control in non-diabetic patients is less clear.
In diabetic patients, early postoperative management of esophagectomy favors low-carbohydrate enteral nutrition (EN) over standard EN to suppress the risk of glycemic spike.
Our single-center, randomized phase II trial seeks to test the hypothesis that low-carbohydrate EN can suppress hyperglycemia in non-diabetic patients who undergo esophagectomy.
Herewith we present the study protocol.
