Apigenin (APN), a natural flavonoid, showed strong therapeutic potential against skin cancer, but its clinical use is restricted due to its complex physicochemical characteristics.
The topical treatment of skin cancer with lipidic nanocarriers offers various advantages.
Hence, this study aimed to fabricate APN-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (APN-SLNs) for improved topical treatment of skin cancer.
The pure APN and APN-SLNs were further loaded into hydrogels for better topical application.
The developed APN-SLNs demonstrated a mean size of 174.3 ± 6.7 nm, polydispersity index of 0.18 ± 0.02, surface charge of -29.5 ± 2.9 mV, and encapsulation efficiency of 85.7 ± 3.5%.
The developed APN-SLNs were evaluated for compatibility and crystallinity by employing FT-IR, DSC, and XRD.
The developed APN-SLNs represented excellent colloidal stability and a biphasic release profile.
The developed APN-SLNs-loaded hydrogels represented comparatively higher viscosity, firmness, consistency, and cohesiveness compared with the pure APN-loaded hydrogels.
The APN-SLNs-loaded hydrogels represented >2 times higher
