Mammography revealed a large, lobulated, hyperdense mass in the right breast occupying nearly the entire breast and axillary region.
A smaller but similar lobulated mass was present in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast.
BIRADS 4 classification was assigned to both breasts, indicating suspicious findings requiring further evaluation.
Based on histopathologic evaluation, it was found that the breast was involved by chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
