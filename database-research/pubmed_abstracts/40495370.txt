Few population-based studies have rigorously evaluated overall survival (OS) differences among adults treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy (chemo/immunotherapy) for multiple myeloma (MM) during the past two decades when the therapeutic landscape substantially evolved.
We evaluated OS among 50 288 adults diagnosed with MM between 2000 and 2019 reported to have received initial chemo/immunotherapy.
We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using multivariable Cox regression to compare OS across calendar periods and within patient demographic groups.
OS improved over time (2000-2004 = reference; HR
