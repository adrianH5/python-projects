Autophagy, a vital cellular process, plays a significant role in the development of a spectrum of diseases, notably cancer.
The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic significance and explore the possible roles of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and in 33 cancer types.
