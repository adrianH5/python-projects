Large-scale metabolomic analyses of pan-cancer cell line panels have provided significant insights into the relationships between metabolism and cancer cell biology.
Here, we took a pathway-centric approach by transforming targeted metabolomic data into ratios to study associations between reactant and product metabolites in a panel of cancer and non-cancer cell lines.
We identified five clusters of cells from various tissue origins.
Of these, cells in Cluster 4 had high ratios of TCA cycle metabolites relative to pyruvate, produced more lactate yet consumed less glucose and glutamine, and greater OXPHOS activity compared to Cluster 3 cells with low TCA cycle metabolite ratios.
This was due to more glutamine cataplerotic efflux and not glycolysis in cells of Cluster 4.
In silico analyses of loss-of-function and drug sensitivity screens showed that Cluster 4 cells were more susceptible to gene deletion and drug targeting of glutamine metabolism and OXPHOS than cells in Cluster 3.
Our results highlight the potential of pathway-centric approaches to reveal new aspects of cellular metabolism from metabolomic data.
