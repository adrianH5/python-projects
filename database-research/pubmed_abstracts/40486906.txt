Malignant melanoma ranks among the most aggressive forms of cancer, with high rates of metastasis and recurrence, as well as a poor prognosis.
Consequently, an urgent need is to develop novel precision therapeutic strategies and corresponding drugs.
Previous studies have shown that both X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) participate in the resistance of melanoma to chemotherapy-induced cell death.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives of natural compounds derived from
