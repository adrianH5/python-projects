In recent decades, targeted therapy using small molecule inhibitors (SMI) have been shown very promising results in the treatment of a variety of solid and hematopoietic malignancies.
However, their exact mechanisms, especiallay on the evasion strategies of tumor cells from the host immune system are not fully understood.
The current study investigates the effects of two SMIs, ibrutinib and venetoclax, on the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
