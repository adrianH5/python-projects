Operative intervention with multimodal therapy, including systemic therapy and/or radiation, is routinely used in the curative-intent treatment of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Occasionally, patients are unable to undergo multimodal therapy.
However, contemporary data on the benefit of surgery-alone for patients with resectable PDAC are limited.
