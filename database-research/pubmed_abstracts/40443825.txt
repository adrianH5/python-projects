Conventional inhibitors of immune checkpoints such as anti-programmed death-1 and its ligand (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4) have revolutionized therapeutic approaches to cancer, establishing immunotherapy as the standard of care for many cancers.
A significant number of cancers, however, remain refractory to the inhibition of these immune checkpoints, leading to the search for alternative immune checkpoints that are more relevant to those diseases.
Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated efferocytosis is an increasingly appreciated immune checkpoint with a profound impact on the phenotype of the tumor microenvironment (TME).
TAMs perform their efferocytic function through the receptor MerTK, and MerTK activity correlates with tumor progression.
To combat efferocytosis in the TME, we developed poly[[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-
