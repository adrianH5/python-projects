Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer with a poor prognosis in advanced cases.
Despite reported sensitivities to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, response rates remain limited to approximately 50â€¯% of cases.
Although developing novel therapeutic strategies against MCC has been desired, few preclinical models, including cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), are available.
