Pleural mesothelioma (PM) is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis, often driven by asbestos exposure.
Mutations in the NF2 gene, a key regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, are frequently observed in PM.
However, their impact on tumor biology, immune infiltration, cytokine signaling, and therapeutic response remains poorly understood.
