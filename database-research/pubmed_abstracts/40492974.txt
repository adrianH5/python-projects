Telomerase reverse transcriptase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length in rapidly dividing cells, thus enabling cellular immortality.
Despite being recognized as an important cancer target for decades, no small molecule telomerase inhibitors have been approved as anticancer therapeutics to date.
Several limitations, including the absence of high-throughput screening tools, have posed challenges to the telomerase drug discovery field.
Here, we describe a high-throughput, fluorescently coupled screening methodemploying a chemically modified reporter nucleotide.
We utilize the
