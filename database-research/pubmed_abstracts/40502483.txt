Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), represents a serious complication after liver resection, significantly impacting the long-term outcomes for patients who undergo such surgeries.
There exists a strong correlation between intraoperative hemorrhage and transfusion requirements with the development of PHLF.
Presently, a combination of hepatic portal occlusion techniques alongside controlled low central venous pressure (CLCVP) methodologies is extensively employed to mitigate intraoperative bleeding.
Nonetheless, limited studies have analyzed the risk factors for PHLF under CLCVP.
