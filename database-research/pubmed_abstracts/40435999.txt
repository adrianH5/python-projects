Although it is generally agreed that the perspectives of patients should be included in decision-making about genomic data, patients rarely have a significant role in the governance of genomic data archives (GDAs).
Guidance on the successful implementation of patient involvement (PI) in the governance of GDAs is lacking.
This study explores the perspectives of German patients on PI in the governance of GDAs and how these perspectives can be implemented to have an impact on governance.
