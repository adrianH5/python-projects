The medicinal phytochemical oleandrin (Ole) is obtained from the Nerium oleander plant.
The exact relationship between Ole-induced apoptosis and autophagy in gastric cancer (GC) is unclear despite the fact that it has outstanding anti-tumor capabilities.
This research aimed to demonstrate how autophagy and Ole-induced apoptosis interact in GC.
