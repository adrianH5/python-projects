We previously developed and validated a 15-gene prognostic signature (15G score) in localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
Given its ability to differentiate aggressive and indolent disease, we sought to apply the 15G score to patients with metastatic ccRCC to evaluate its prognostic performance in this setting.
