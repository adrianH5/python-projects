This protocol describes a minimally invasive endoscopic technique for the removal of colloid cysts located in the third ventricle.
These cysts are a rare type of intracranial lesion that can obstruct cerebrospinal fluid flow.
If left untreated, they may cause hydrocephalus or, in severe cases, even sudden death.
The objective of this approach is to provide a safe and effective alternative to traditional microsurgical methods.
It does so by reducing postoperative pain, surgical morbidity, and hospital stays.
The protocol delineates meticulous preoperative preparations, encompassing patient positioning and equipment setup, followed by a systematic step-by-step guide to the endoscopic surgical procedure.
This protocol involves the use of intraoperative ultrasound guidance for precise navigation, incision of the cyst wall, aspiration of cyst contents, and meticulous hemostasis.
Special care is taken to minimize damage to surrounding neural structures, ensuring complete cyst removal while reducing the risk of complications.
The efficacy of this minimally invasive approach is substantiated by the observation that it is associated with reduced operation times, minimal neurological deficits, and rapid postoperative recovery.
Typically, patients are able to resume mobilization the day after surgery and are discharged within two days.
This protocol serves as a comprehensive guide for neurosurgeons aiming to enhance surgical precision while maximizing patient outcomes.
The successful utilization of this protocol is dependent on meticulous preoperative planning, advanced intraoperative navigation techniques, and the employment of specialized endoscopic instruments.
