Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a genetic disease characterized by important developmental changes, among which craniofacial abnormalities with negative repercussions on the volume of the upper airways stand out.
The treatment of dentofacial deformities associated with TRS in adulthood includes orthognathic surgery to correct the positioning of the jaws, providing functional benefits such as adequate dental occlusion, stability of mandibular movements and airways expansion.
The aim of this report is to present the management of an adult individual with RTS who presented significant craniofacial deformity, severe obstructive sleep apnea and sequelae from previous surgical interventions.
