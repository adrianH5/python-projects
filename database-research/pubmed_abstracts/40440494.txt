Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide.
More than 80% of new cases of invasive BC are diagnosed among women aged 50 years or older, and they mainly comprise estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and HER2-negative subtypes of the disease.
About 91% of deaths occur in this age demographic.
Treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors has resulted in significantly increased survival benefits in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival (OS), but evidence for their use in treating older women with metastatic BC is limited.
Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy in older women with HR+/HER-2 metastatic or advanced BC.
