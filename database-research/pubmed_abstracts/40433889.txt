Primary Ewing sarcoma (ES) of the kidney is rare.
We describe the clinicopathologic features of primary renal ES with emphasis on gene fusion partners.
A multi-institutional study was conducted to obtain clinicopathologic data on primary ES of the kidney.
All tumors with available tissue underwent NGS to determine fusion partners.
Twenty-four patients (8 male, 16 female) were identified.
Mean age was 33.2 (±12.3).
Mean tumor size was 10.5 cm (±4.2).
Clinical presentation was available in 21 patients: flank/abdominal pain (13, 61.9%), hematuria (4, 19%), mass (2, 9.5%), hypertension (1, 4.8%), and incidental (1, 4.8%).
For 23 nephrectomies, 2 (8.7%) were ypT0 (post-neoadjuvant therapy), 3 (13%) pT1, 15 (65.2%) pT2, 1 (4.4%) pT3, and 2 (8.7%) pT4.
Four (16.7%) had metastatic disease at presentation.
Of 18 patients with available follow-up, 9 (50%) were alive with disease, 7 (38.9%) alive with no disease, and 2 (11.1%) died of disease (mean follow-up 34 mo).
Metastatic disease was documented in 9/18 patients, including lung (3), adrenal (2), bone (2), retroperitoneum (2), liver (2), lymph node (1), and ureter (1).
FISH was performed in 14 tumors and real-time quantitative PCR in 1, confirming EWSR1 rearrangements.
NGS was performed in 17 tumors, showing EWSR1::FLI1 in 16 (94.1%) and EWSR1::ETV4 in 1.
Primary renal ES is a rare neoplasm occurring in a wide age range.
Most tumors invaded adjacent tissues.
Although they share similar histologic and molecular features with their counterpart in the bone/soft tissue, we document the first case of a rare EWSR1::ETV4 fusion in the kidney.
