The benefit of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) following modern primary systemic therapy (PST) in HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) remains under investigation.
The current study evaluates RNI practice patterns and outcomes based on the pathological response to PST in clinically node-positive (cN+) HER2 + BC.
