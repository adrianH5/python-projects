Intraoperative blood loss (IBL) is the major concern in hepatectomy, which was closely relating to the central venous pressure (CVP).
The controlled low central venous pressure (CLCVP) technique is moderately required for minimizing hemorrhage during hepatectomy nowadays.
Nevertheless, an excessive reduction in CVP might give rise to the jeopardy of inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
Sildenafil, being a first-line pharmaceutical for treating pulmonary hypertension, its mechanism of action lies in diminishing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by dilating pulmonary arteries, and thereby alleviating the afterload of the right ventricle.
We initially postulate that administration of sildenafil citrate in combination with intermittent Pringle's maneuver (IPM) can exert a notable impact in efficaciously reducing intraoperative blood loss (IBL), enhancing the surgical field of vision, and augmenting the safety of the operation.
