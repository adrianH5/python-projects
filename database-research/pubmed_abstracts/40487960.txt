Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs) are a class of histologically well-differentiated adenomas that can proliferate outside the appendix in the form of malignant tumours, resulting in the accumulation of external appendiceal mucus.
They may present as an extra-appendiceal mass-like bulge, mucus or polypoid tissue at the appendiceal orifice, or even with abdominal dissemination.
The surgical approach is usually appendectomy, ileocecal resection or right hemicolectomy.
It is essential to raise awareness of LAMNs and choose an appropriate treatment.
