Study advances current diagnostic efficiency of canine/feline (sub-)cutaneous tumors using machine learning and multimodal imaging data.
White light (WL), fluorescence (FL) and ultrasound (US) imaging were combined into hybrid approaches to differentiate between malignant mastocytomas, soft tissue sarcomas and benign lipomas.
Support Vector Machine and Ensemble classifiers were optimized
