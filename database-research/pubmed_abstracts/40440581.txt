PD-L1 positivity in biliary tract cancers (BTCs) is reported from 4% to 76%.
BTC clinical trials have not demonstrated PD-L1 expression as a predictor of response to chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor (chemo-ICI).
This meta-analysis examines PD-L1 positivity rates in BTC and association between PD-L1 expression and outcomes in patients treated with chemo-ICI.
