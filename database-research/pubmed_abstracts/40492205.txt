Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has a poor prognosis and a high recurrence rate.
Predicting the outcomes of AIS patients in the early stages of the disease is therefore important.
The establishment of intracerebral collateral circulation significantly improves the survival of brain cells and the outcomes of AIS patients.
However, no machine learning method has been applied to investigate the correlation between the dynamic evolution of intracerebral venous collateral circulation and AIS prognosis.
Therefore, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to analyze asymmetrically prominent cortical veins (APCVs) and deep medullary veins (DMVs) to establish a radiomic model for predicting the prognosis of AIS by combining clinical indicators.
