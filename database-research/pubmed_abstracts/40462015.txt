Endosome-associated trafficking regulator 1 (ENTR1), also known as Serologically Defined Colon Cancer Antigen 3 (SDCCAG3), was initially identified in colon cancer and plays a crucial role in protein transport.
Preliminary studies indicate that ENTR1 is involved in the growth of certain tumor types.
