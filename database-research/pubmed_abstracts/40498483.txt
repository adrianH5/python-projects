Racial and ethnic disparities in pathologic complete response (pCR) and overall survival (OS) have been reported in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
In addition to socioeconomic factors and access to care, differences in tumor biology may affect outcomes.
The association of ERBB2-low expression with outcomes in patients with TNBC has been minimally explored, including studies evaluating outcomes based on race and ethnicity.
