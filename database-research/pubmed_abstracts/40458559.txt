Replication factor C subunit 4 (RFC4) plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of some cancers; however, its relationship with tumor-infiltrating immune cells in cervical cancer (CC) has not been comprehensively analyzed.
This study aimed to determine whether RFC4 overexpression affects overall survival in CC and to explore its impact and potential mechanisms on the tumor immune microenvironment.
