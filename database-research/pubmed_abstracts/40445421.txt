Currently, two main challenges in cancer immunotherapy commonly hinder the application of T cell receptor-modified T cell (TCR-T) therapy in the treatment of solid tumors, including the limited ability of T cells to infiltrate solid tumor tissues and the immunosuppressive signals that restrain the anti-tumor efficacy of T cells.
In this study, we constructed NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T and introduced polyethylene glycol-phospholipids (PEG-lipids) to stably modify NY-ESO-1 TCR-T with nonapeptide iRGD, aiming to enhance the penetrability of T cells in vivo, then we combined iRGD-modified NY-ESO-1 TCR-T (iRGD-NY-ESO-1 TCR-T) with PD-1 blockade to alleviate immunosuppressive signals.
In result, it isÂ suggested that stably modifying NY-ESO-1 TCR-T with iRGD is a simple and effective strategy to enable TCR-T to target and penetrate solid tumor tissues.
Besides, the combination of iRGD-NY-ESO-1 TCR-T with PD-1 blockade presents a novel synergistic strategy for the treatment of refractory NY-ESO-1-positive solid tumors.
