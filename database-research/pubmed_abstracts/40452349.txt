Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global public health issue.
In Tanzania, TB prevalence and incidence rose by 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively, from 2020 to 2021.
Current public health strategies focus mainly on HIV/AIDS-related TB, often neglecting other immunosuppressive conditions.
This study aimed to assess the prevalence of immunosuppressive conditions beyond HIV in TB patients and explore their interactions.
