We studied change in mammographic density (MD) among premenopausal women with a pathogenic germline variant (PGV) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, comparing those who did and did not undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in the interval between mammograms, accounting for changes in exogenous oral contraceptive (OC) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use.
