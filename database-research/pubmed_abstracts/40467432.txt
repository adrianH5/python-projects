The ACTION Teens study (NCT05013359) surveyed adolescents living with obesity (ALwO), caregivers (CGs) of ALwO, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) of ALwO, to identify behaviors, perceptions, attitudes, and barriers to effective obesity care.
The goal was to generate insights to help improve obesity management for ALwO, both globally and locally.
Here, we discuss insufficient management of adolescent obesity in Taiwan.
