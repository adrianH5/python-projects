Brain glycogen phosphorylase (PYGB) facilitates the breakdown of glycogen, thereby supplying energy to tumor cells.
While PYGB expression has been documented in various tumor types, its specific function in lung cancer (LC) remains to be elucidated.
This study aims to explore the potential involvement of PYGB in the initiation and progression of LC.
