The predictive value of tumor mutation burden (TMB) on the efficacy of immunotherapy has been confirmed in multiple cancer types in previous studies.
For urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), whether TMB is a suitable biomarker to predict the benefit of ICIs remains a matter of much debate.
We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the role of TMB in patients with UC treated with ICIs.
