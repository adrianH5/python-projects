Palliative sedation (PS) is a therapeutic measure used in end-of-life care to alleviate the suffering caused by refractory symptoms.
The objectives of our study were to determine the frequency of PS in a specialized inpatient acute palliative care unit (APCU), describe the characteristics of patients who received PS, compare patients who required PS with those who did not, and compare patients who received a single medication for PS with those who received multiple medications.
