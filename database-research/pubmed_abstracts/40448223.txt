This research protocol for the study ATICC (Addiction, Trauma and Immigration, prevention and Cross-Cultural support for care with the Grand Est youth network) aims to model the complex interrelations between trauma, substance use behaviors, migration and representations of mental health among vulnerable youth residing in Transitional Housing for Young Adults.
This study focuses on a specific and underexplored population, many of whom have experienced traumatic events and/or complex migratory trajectories.
The ultimate objective of this research is to develop transferable models of understanding that can inform the design of prevention and support programs tailored to this demographic.
