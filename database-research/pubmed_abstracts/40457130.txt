This review aims to investigate the relationship between dietary changes and the microbiome in patients with diabetes and colorectal cancer (CRC).
The link between CRC and type 2 diabetes is momentous, as individuals with diabetes have a 40-60% higher risk of developing CRC and often experience lower survival rates.
However, limited studies explore how diabetes may contribute to the progression to CRC through changes in the microbiome.
By clarifying these connections, this review summarizes mechanisms in type 2 diabetes and CRC through microbiota pathways, presenting evidence from clinical trials regarding nutritional interventions for treating both conditions.
We will focus on how nutritional components can alter the gut microbiome, highlighting the potential role of nutritional adjustments as adjuvant therapy for patients with diabetes who are facing precancerous or cancerous conditions.
