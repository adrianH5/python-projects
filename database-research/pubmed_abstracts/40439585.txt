ILC2 are critical regulators of inflammation and tissue homeostasis in diverse anatomical sites.
ILC2-targeted mouse models have underpinned this emerging field of research.
In this issue of JEM, (Kabil et al.
https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20241671) developed a novel Il17rbCreERT2.eGFP mouse to study the role of Rora in mature ILC2.
