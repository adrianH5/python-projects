The glutamate-glutamine cycle is thought to be the principle metabolic pathway that recycles glutamate at synapses.
In this cycle, synaptically released glutamate is sequestered by astrocytes and forms glutamine, before being returned to the presynaptic terminal for conversion back into glutamate to replenish the neurotransmitter pool.
While many aspects of this cycle are established, a key component remains unknown: the nature of the transporter responsible for the presynaptic uptake of glutamine.
We hypothesise that neurotransmitter transporter 4 (NTT4/SLC6A17) plays this role.
Accordingly, we generated NTT4 knockout mice to assess its contribution to presynaptic glutamine transport and synaptic glutamate supply.
