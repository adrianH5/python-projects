Advanced prostate cancer (PrCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related death among men because nearly all patients progress on standard therapy that targets androgen receptor (AR) signaling.
An important mechanism driving therapeutic resistance is lineage plasticity, the ability of PrCa cells to reprogram into lineage variants like neuroendocrine (NE) PrCa that no longer depend on AR signaling.
The histone methyltransferase EZH2 has been implicated in PrCa lineage plasticity and EZH2 inhibitors are being evaluated clinically for the treatment of PrCa.
