Patients undergoing major gastrointestinal oncologic surgeries often present with frailty, sarcopenia, anemia, and comorbidities that reduce physiological reserves and impair recovery.
Prehabilitation is a proactive, multidisciplinary approach designed to optimize patient's health before surgery, thereby enhancing their capacity to tolerate surgical stress.
Evidence indicates that prehabilitation can lead to shorter hospital stays, reduced intensive care admissions, a lower incidence of postoperative complications, and improved long-term quality of life.
