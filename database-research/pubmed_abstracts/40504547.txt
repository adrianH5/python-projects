CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) are cornerstone therapies in Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (HER2-) Breast Cancer (BC) and emerging evidence suggests that they may influence immune function, potentially enhancing antitumor immunity but also triggering autoimmune reactions.
This study aims to investigate the prevalence of autoimmune diseases (AD) in patients with HR+/HER2- BC to identify potential predictive biomarkers and to assess the impact of AD on disease progression.
