Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disease in which the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) system is affected, resulting in defective DNA-repair.
Clinical features are UV-light hypersensitivity with erythema, corneal lesions, and increased risk for skin cancers.
Around 20% of affected individuals develop neurological manifestations like movement disorders due to neurodegeneration.
