Expression and functional dysregulation of ion channel genes are correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
Ion channel signature for predicting the prognosis of individuals with LUAD.
94 ion channel-related differentially expressed genes in LUAD were identified from TCGA-LUAD, and ion channel-based LUAD risk model was established and validated using the GEO cohort.
Survival analysis outcomes demonstrated that low-risk LUAD patients were accompanied with higher survival rates.
Cox analysis manifested that LUAD prognostic risk score was an independent prognosticactor.
We plotted a nomogram with clinical utility based on LUAD risk score and clinical factors.
Differentially expressed genes in LUAD patients of different risk groups were enriched in biological functions and signaling pathways related to ion channels, cancer transcription dysregulation, and immunity.
Immune infiltration results suggested that LUAD patients with low risk scores exhibited better immune cell infiltration and function.
Prediction results of immunotherapy response showed that LUAD patients with low risk scores had a higher chance of benefiting from immunotherapy.
The drug prediction results showed that individuals with LUAD in the low-risk group were more sensitive to paclitaxel, BI 2536, pyrimethamine, and VX-680, while individuals with LUAD in the high-risk group to erlotinib, sorafenib, panitumumab, PHA-665752, and roscovitine.
In summary, ion channel-related genes can provide valuable information for prognosis assessment and drug treatment of LUAD patients.
