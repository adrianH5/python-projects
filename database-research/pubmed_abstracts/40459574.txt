Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital foregut anomalies, often detected incidentally.
We report the case of a 24-year-old female who was incidentally detected during a routine health check-up to have a mediastinal mass.
Preoperative chest computed tomography imaging suggested a benign bronchogenic cyst.
Minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was planned for its excision.
Intraoperatively, a pericardial defect and a feeding artery arising from the aortic arch were noted.
The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 3.
This case demonstrates the utility of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in the excision of bronchogenic cysts, in the presence of these intraoperative findings with the advantages of less surgical trauma and faster recovery.
