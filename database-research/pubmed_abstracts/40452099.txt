Juvenile angiofibroma of nasopharynx is a benign but locally aggressive tumor predominantly affecting adolescent males, characterized by hypervascular growth in the nasopharynx.
Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial to prevent complications.
Symptoms typically include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and hearing loss.
Imaging techniques, such as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, play a pivotal role in assessing tumor size, vascularity, and involvement of surrounding structures.
Angiography, followed by embolization, is commonly used to reduce intraoperative bleeding risk.
The treatment of choice is surgical resection, which can be performed via an endonasal, transpalatal, or combined approach, depending on tumor extent.
In cases of inoperable tumors or recurrence, radiation therapy may be considered.
Although nasopharyngeal juvenile angiofibroma has a favorable prognosis when treated early, close monitoring for recurrence is necessary, as it can reappear even years after surgery.
Multidisciplinary management involving otolaryngologists, radiologists, and oncologists is essential for optimal outcomes.
