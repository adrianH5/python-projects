Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a growing global public health issue, with an estimated prevalence of around 11% in the most developed countries.
This study, conducted as part of the European project CitieS-Health, aimed to estimate the prevalence of CKD in the Serchio Valley, Tuscany, Italy, an area subject to environmental contamination from various sources, including a potentially polluting copper foundry.
