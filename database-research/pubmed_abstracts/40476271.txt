The use of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion has increased rapidly in the past decade.
The approximation of the ileum toward the urethral stump could be a demanding step.
Whereas the techniques for reconstruction have been described in detail, a comprehensive depiction of strategies to facilitate neobladder-urethral approximation is lacking.
This manuscript and video collection provide a summary of the techniques and maneuvers suggested by RARC surgeons.
