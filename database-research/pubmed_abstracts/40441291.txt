Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) accounts for 20% of all skin cancer mortality globally, making it the second-highest subtype of skin cancer.
The high prevalence of cSCC in humans highlights the need to uncover alternative actors and mechanisms influencing skin cancer development.
Significant advances have been made to better understand some key factors in cSCC growth.
However, little is known about the role of noncoding RNAs, particularly of a specific subclass termed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA).
By performing pseudobulk analysis of single-cell sequencing data from normal and cSCC human skin tissues, we determined a global portfolio of lncRNAs specifically expressed in keratinocyte subpopulations.
Integration of CRISPR interference screens in vitro and the xenograft model identified several lncRNAs impacting the growth of cSCC cancer lines both in vitro and in vivo.
Among these, we further validated LINC00704 and LINC01116 as proliferation-regulating lncRNAs in cSCC lines and potential biomarkers of cSCC growth.
Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive signature of lncRNAs with roles in regulating cSCC growth.
