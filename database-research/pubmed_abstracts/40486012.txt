Uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC) is known as the sixth most common cancer in the world.
Advances in bioinformatics and deep learning have provided the 2 tools for screening large-scale genomic data and discovering potential biomarkers indicative of disease states.
This study aimed to investigate the identification of important genes for diagnosis and prognosis in the uterus using bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms.
