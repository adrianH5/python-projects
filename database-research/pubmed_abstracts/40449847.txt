Tissue mechanics involved in carcinogenesis by regulating cell morphology and structure, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions are not fully understood.
Plectin, a cytolinker and a critical component of the cell-ECM adhesion complex hemidesmosome (HD), plays an important role in the regulation of epithelial tissue mechanics, but its functions in carcinogenesis remain elusive.
