To prevent lung cancer-related death, the German Social Accident Insurance (Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung) offers lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to persons older than 54 years with a history of occupational asbestos exposure and smoking (EVA-LCS).
Participation is voluntary; however, it is subject to prior medical consultation.
Evidence-based decision aids can inform eligible persons about relevant aspects of LDCT prior to medical consultation and thus contribute to independent and informed decision making.The aim of this study was to develop an evidence-based decision aid and test it in a target group.Based on literature search and methodological research, a decision aid focusing on benefits and risks of LDCT in EVA-LCS was developed.
For the pilot-testing, eligible persons were interviewed regarding comprehensibility and information value of the decision aid.
The semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed and content analysed according to Kuckartz.Interviews with 13 male participants were conducted.
The decision aid was well accepted, and the content was understood by most of the interviewees.
Ambiguities arose in the context of a pictograph displaying benefits of LDCT screening.
The information value was found overall to be adequate.
However, many participants considered themselves already well informed.
Even though it became evident that trust in medical advice has a major influence on the decision, the decision aid was perceived as a good addition to inform oneself in advance.
Additionally, most respondents rated the design and volume of the decision aid as appropriate.First-time participants may benefit most from a decision aid as they get all relevant information about LDCT for EVA-LCS in one brochure.
This may enable them to learn more about the benefits and harms and make an informed decision as part of the shared decision-making.
