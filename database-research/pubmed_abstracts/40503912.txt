Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate tumor progression by facilitating signal transduction between cancer cells and the microenvironment, positioning them as critical biomarkers for diagnosis.
CD20 is a key surface antigen of B cells, and its detection is of great significance for lymphoma detection and therapy monitoring.
However, conventional EVs detection methods suffer from high costs, operational complexity, and limited sensitivity.
Here, we developed an electrochemical immunosensor utilizing a Lewis acid-boosted nanozyme, Ce/UiO-67, which was synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method.
