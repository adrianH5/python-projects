Mushroom-derived polysaccharides are known for their diverse biological activities, including immunomodulatory and anticancer properties.
Breast cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide, lacks targeted molecular therapies, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic agents.
In this study, we extracted, purified, and characterized a novel heteropolysaccharide (HTP) - a rhamnogalactan - composed of galactose (72.6 %) and rhamnose (27.4 %) from the edible mushroom Lactarius quieticolor.
Structural analysis revealed that HTP consists of a (1 → 6)-linked α-d-galactopyranose backbone, heavily substituted at O-2 by non-reducing rhamnose units, with a weight-average molar mass of 2.41 × 10
