Survival endpoints are the cornerstone of cancer research.
Their accuracy depends on the quality of the data sources, and many sources of survival data, such as electronic medical records (EMRs), provide incomplete data.
It is unknown how often retrospective studies in oncology journals report their survival data sources or use high-quality sources.
