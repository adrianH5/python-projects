Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive pancreatic malignant tumor with poor prognosis due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) and metastatic potential.
Fibroblasts play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) and influencing the immune response.
This study explored migrasome-associated fibroblasts, especially TSPAN4 and ITGA5, as key regulators of pancreatic cancer metastasis, aiming to provide new ideas for therapeutic strategies targeting TME.
