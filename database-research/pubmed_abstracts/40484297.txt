Currently certain mushrooms are used as low-calorie food supplements due to their excellent taste, and presence of a variety of essential vitamins, minerals and secondary metabolites.
Many of them have therapeutic significance and are used in traditional medicines.
Mushrooms cells can also be used as biocatalysts for the derivatization of organic compounds.
During the current study, 3Î²-hydroxy-24-methylenelanost-8-en-21-oic acid (1) was isolated from Laetiporus sulphureus (Bull.)
Murrill.
The cell culture of the same mushroom was used for the biotransformation of breast cancer drug, exemestane (2) into a new metabolite, 18-hydroxy-6-methylene-androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (3).
Compounds 1, and 3 were purified by using various chromatographic techniques, and their structures were determined with the help of 1D- and 2D-NMR, HREI-MS, and IR spectroscopic techniques.
Since compound 1 also has a steroidal skeleton (like aromatase inhibiting drug exemestane (2)), the metabolite 1 was also evaluated for its aromatase inhibiting potential along with a new transformed product 3.
Aromatase plays a crucial role in estrogen biosynthesis, making its inhibition a key therapeutic strategy for treating estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.
Compounds 1 and 3 demonstrated significant aromatase inhibition, with IC
