The apolipoprotein ε4 allele (APOE4) is associated with decreased longevity and increased vulnerability to age-related declines and disorders across multiple systems.
Interventions that promote healthspan and lifespan represent a promising strategy to attenuate the development of APOE4-associated aging phenotypes.
Here, we studied the ability of the longevity-promoting intervention 17α-estradiol (17αE2) to protect against impairments in APOE4 versus the predominant APOE3 genotype using early middle-aged mice with knock-in of human APOE alleles.
