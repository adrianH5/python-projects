Human Zymogen granule protein 16 homolog B (ZG16B), a secreted lectin, plays critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis through regulating autocrine and paracrine signaling.
Its overexpression in multiple cancers, including pancreatic, colorectal, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.
However, despite its elevated expression in multiple tumor types, the structural and functional consequences of genetic variants in ZG16B remain poorly understood.
This study aimed to characterize deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the
