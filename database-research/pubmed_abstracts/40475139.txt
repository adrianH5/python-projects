Most genetic variants that confer risk of complex immune-mediated diseases (IMD) affect gene regulation in specific cell types.
Their target genes and focus cell types are often unknown, partially because some effects are hidden in untested cell states.
B cells play important roles in IMDs, including autoimmune, allergic, infectious, and cancerous diseases.
However, despite this established importance, B cell activation states are underrepresented in functional genomics studies.
In this study, we obtained B cells from 26 healthy female donors.
We stimulated B cells
