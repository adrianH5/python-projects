The hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) is the most widely used first-line treatment for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) due to its survival benefits.
Effective management of higher-risk MDS requires addressing not only clinical outcomes but also the burden of healthcare resource utilisation (hospitalisations and transfusions), which remains poorly characterised.
