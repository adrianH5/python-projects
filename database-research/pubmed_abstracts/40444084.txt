Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), a subset of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), originates from primary tumors and metastatic lesions in cancer patients, often carrying genomic variations identical to those of the primary tumor.
ctDNA analysis via liquid biopsy has proven to be a valuable biomarker for early cancer detection, minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment, monitoring tumor recurrence, and evaluating treatment efficacy.
However, despite advancements in ctDNA analysis technologies, standardized protocols for its extraction and detection have yet to be established.
Each step of the process-from pre-analytical variables to detection techniques-significantly impacts the accuracy and reliability of ctDNA analysis.
This review examines recent developments in ctDNA detection methods, focusing on pre-analytical factors such as specimen types, collection tubes, centrifugation protocols, and storage conditions, alongside high-throughput and ultra-sensitive detection technologies.
It also briefly discusses the clinical potential of liquid biopsy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
