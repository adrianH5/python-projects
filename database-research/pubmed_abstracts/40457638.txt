Neglecting imaging gradients in b-value calculations has been a documented issue for decades and remains unaccounted for in the current postprocessing pipelines.
This omission may introduce inaccuracies that propagate into diffusion parameter estimates, such as in ADC and DTI analysis.
Because intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) makes use of low b-values, these inaccuracies may be of greater importance.
This study examines the impact of biased b-values on IVIM analysis in simulations and in vivo.
