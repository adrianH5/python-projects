Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by complex genetic and molecular features that contribute to poor prognosis and low cure rates.
Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets is crucial for improving treatment efficacy and patient survival.
This study investigated the potential role of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a known regulator of gene expression, in AML pathogenesis and prognosis.
