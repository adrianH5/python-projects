Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are well-known inducers of gut dysbiosis because oral bacteria cannot be sterilized owing to their gastric acid-suppressing effect.
PPI-induced gut dysbiosis is associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
Although vonoprazan exhibits more powerful acid suppression than PPIs, its effect on ICI therapy outcomes remains unknown.
We evaluated vonoprazan on ICI therapy efficacy in patients with NSCLC.
