The expression of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker proteins was assessed in tumor samples of B16 skin melanoma-bearing mice after chloroquine or lithium administration.
Chloroquine increased the expression of CAF markers (Î±SMA and FAP).
Hence, chloroquine can contribute to the activation of individual CAF populations in melanoma.
In addition, a decrease in the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and an increase in the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin were observed after chloroquine administration, which may indicate activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes in the tumor.
