Current estimates suggest 9 million to 19 million people worldwide are affected by Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection, though significant discrepancies in diagnostic guideline implementation across regions and countries indicate these figures may not fully capture the true disease burden.
HDV coinfection and superinfection with hepatitis B hasten disease progression, increasing cirrhosis and liver cancer risks, highlighting the importance of early and precise diagnosis.
We present a thorough analysis of current and emerging hepatitis D diagnostic methods.
Initial diagnosis involves detecting serum anti-HDV antibodies using radioisotope- or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
Established techniques like chemiluminescence immunoassay, quantitative microarray antibody capture, and lateral flow assays are being improved.
Additional diagnostic markers include HDV antigens and RNA in the serum or liver, detectable through methods like northern and slot blots, fluorescence
