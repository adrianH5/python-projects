Wound healing is a complex process encompassing four main stages: hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, maturation, and differentiation.
Timolol (TM) may influence these stages, particularly re-epithelialization.
This study aims to evaluate the 1-month effects of timolol on acute surgical wounds in post-mammoplasty patients.
