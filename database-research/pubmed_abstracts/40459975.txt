Standard of care for locoregionally advanced HPV-positive OPSCC is definitive chemoradiation with doses up to 70Â Gy and concurrent cisplatin.
Radiation techniques have evolved considerably from 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) to the now widely used intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT).
Many centers are also incorporating stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton therapy to deliver even more conformal treatments that can minimize dose to normal organs at risk, thereby improving the therapeutic ratio.
We review here the advancements and current landscape of radiation therapy for HPV+ OPSCC.
