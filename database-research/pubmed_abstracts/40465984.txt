The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of inflammatory indices, including the prognostic nutritional index, advanced lung cancer inflammation index, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, Glasgow Prognostic Score, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio, in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and to determine whether any of the indices are correlated.
