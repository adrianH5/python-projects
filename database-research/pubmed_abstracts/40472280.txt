Hepatic atypical lymphoid hyperplasia is a rare borderline lymphoproliferative lesion.
Unlike benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, atypical lymphoid hyperplasia has the potential to transform into lymphoma.
We describe MRI and FDG PET/CT findings in a case of hepatic atypical lymphoid hyperplasia.
The hepatic lesion appeared as a small solid mass with central necrosis and low-grade enhancement on MRI and showed intense FDG uptake with SUVmax of 8.2, mimicking malignancy.
This case suggests that hepatic atypical lymphoid hyperplasia should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis in patients with focal hypermetabolic hepatic lesions.
