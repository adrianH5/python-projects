Tall Cell Carcinoma with Reversed Polarity (TCCRP) is a rare type of invasive breast cancer.
Most available literature focuses on histopathology and gene-sequencing, while few studies offer insights into clinical management.
This report provides a comprehensive review of available literature including 2 new clinical cases to offer insights into the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of TCCRP.
A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed with collation of all cases with appropriate clinicopathologic data available.
Two TCCRP cases with complete clinicopathologic data were identified at our institution and included in the analysis.
Clinical, radiographic, and pathological characteristics were analyzed.
Literature review identified 46 relevant studies, with 88 prior cases reported.
Data was extracted from 14 studies with complete data, and 67 unique cases analyzed.
All patients were female, with a median age of 62 (40-85).
Clinical data included tumor size, receptor status, surgery management, adjuvant therapy, recurrence, and overall survival.
Most cases demonstrate triple-negative status, yet almost all cases behave indolently with excellent prognosis after surgery and little/no adjuvant therapy.
Improved understanding of the clinical behavior of this disease will promote appropriate management and avoid overtreatment.
