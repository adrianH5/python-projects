Dysregulated HER2-mediated RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling drive uncontrolled cell growth and tumorigenesis.
Following our prior report of frequent HER2 mutations in advanced uterine cervical neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), this study expands the genomic landscape by investigating KRAS and PIK3CA as potential therapeutic targets in a cohort of 12 Taiwanese women with cervical NEC.
