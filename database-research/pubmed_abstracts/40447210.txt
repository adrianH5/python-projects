Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women globally, with early detection playing a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and survival rates.
There is an urgent need for novel biomarkers to aid in early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment prediction.
YRNAs, small non-coding RNAs, have been explored as biomarkers in various cancers, but their role in BC remains under-investigated.
This study aimed to explore the expression of circulating plasma YRNAs in BC patients and evaluate their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
