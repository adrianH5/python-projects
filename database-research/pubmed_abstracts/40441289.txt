Lip squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) often arise from actinic cheilitis.
However, factors driving oncogenic transformation and determinants of lip SCC differentiation are unclear.
This study investigated differences between lip SCC and premalignant actinic cheilitis and factors related to tumor differentiation.
We included patients who received biopsies for actinic cheilitis that later progressed to lip SCC.
Moreover, well-differentiated lip SCC and moderately-to-poorly differentiated lip SCC were selected for spatial transcriptomic analysis, using PanCK and CD45 as morphology markers.
