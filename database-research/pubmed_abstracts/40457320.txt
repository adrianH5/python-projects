Molecular biomarkers have become an essential part of the diagnosis of adult-type diffuse glioma.
Still, complex detection methods and long-term turnaround for these biomarkers hinder integrated diagnosis in clinical practice.
We hypothesized that IDH and TERT promoter (TERTp) mutations play similar roles in accurately classifying adult-type diffuse glioma compared to the complicated WHO CNS5-recommended biomarkers, and the detection of IDH and TERTp mutations should be the first layer in clinical practice.
