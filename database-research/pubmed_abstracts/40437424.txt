Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, with rising incidence rates, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
This burden is pronounced in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where Cameroon faces escalating cancer challenges, primarily due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited access to early detection and treatment.
The study aimed to explore the experiences of cancer patients at Mbingo Baptist Hospital in Cameroon in Cameroon, focusing on the barriers to obtaining quality diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care, and to examine the impact of these challenges on their physical, emotional, and social well-being.
