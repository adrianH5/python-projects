Endometrial cancer, which affects the lining of the uterus, is the most common form of uterine cancer (96%), and the sixth most common cancer in females worldwide, accounting for 4.5% of all cancers in females.
In 2022, there were 420,242 cases of uterine cancer and 97,704 deaths from the disease worldwide.
Most women have early-stage endometrial cancer at diagnosis.
Traditionally, surgical staging included removal of all lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) in the pelvis (pelvic lymphadenectomy) with or without para-aortic areas (pelvic/para-aortic lymphadenectomy), to determine the need for further treatment.
However, rates of lymph node involvement are relatively low and may be predicted by uterine histopathology and molecular markers.
Lymphadenectomy carries a significant risk of long-term morbidity from lymphoedema and previous studies comparing pelvic lymphadenectomy with no lymphadenectomy found no survival benefit.
Detecting the first draining lymph node(s) from each side of the uterus, called sentinel lymph node biopsy, can replace lymphadenectomy in terms of accuracy of detecting nodes, but no studies have shown whether sentinel lymph node biopsy is beneficial to women, despite its wide use.
