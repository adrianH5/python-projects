Epitope-based vaccines are promising therapeutic modalities for infectious diseases and cancer, but identifying immunogenic epitopes is challenging.
The vast majority of prediction methods only use amino acid sequence information, and do not incorporate wide-scale structure data and biochemical properties across each peptide-MHC.
We present ImmunoStruct, a deep-learning model that integrates sequence, structural, and biochemical information to predict multi-allele class-I peptide-MHC immunogenicity.
By leveraging a multimodal dataset of âˆ¼27,000 peptide-MHCs, we demonstrate that ImmunoStruct improves immunogenicity prediction performance and interpretability beyond existing methods, across infectious disease epitopes and cancer neoepitopes.
We further show strong alignment with
