Intratumoral immunotherapy (ITIT) delivers immune-stimulating agents or treatments directly into solid tumors to reverse the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enables local and systemic antitumor immunity.
However, optimal clinical strategies for ITIT are not yet fully understood.
Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a plant virus that is not infectious in mammals but is a powerful multi-toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist which stimulates potent antitumor immunity when used in ITIT.
