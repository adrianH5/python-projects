Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising targeted radiotherapy that enables the treatment of cancers at the cellular level.
The crucial aspect of BNCT are boron carriers, which should selectively reach cancer cells by delivering high concentrations of boron.
Therefore, we propose the use of boron carbide (B
