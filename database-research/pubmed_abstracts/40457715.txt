In this article for the Highlights of 2024 Series, we discuss strategies to enhance NK cell-based cancer therapies.
These include (1) cytokine expression on bacterial membranes to boost NK cell activation in tumors, (2) optimizing CAR-NK cell manufacturing for improved efficacy, (3) using CRISPR-Cas9 to identify and target inhibitory genes, and (4) using tetraspecific engagers to enhance cytotoxicity and cytokine memory-like NK cells strengthening anti-tumor responses.
This year's progress holds much promise for cancer treatments exploiting NK cells.
