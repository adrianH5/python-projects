A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic cough presented with bilateral pulmonary masses identified on computed tomography.
A 18F-FDG PET/CT study demonstrated moderate uptake in the lung masses and unexpectedly intense uptake in a proximal transverse colonic lesion.
While the initial interpretation suggested metastatic lung disease from colon cancer, subsequent colonoscopic resection of the colon lesion and biopsy of the lung lesions revealed a sessile serrated adenoma and lipoid pneumonia, respectively.
The patient disclosed a history of mineral oil use for constipation.
