Abiraterone, an active metabolite of abiraterone acetate, is used for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of abiraterone could improve treatment outcomes.
However, its stability in plasma for only 4 hours at room temperature, is making the TDM implementation difficult in clinical practice.
Stabilization experiments were performed in our laboratory using esterase inhibitors for the stabilization of abiraterone acetate in preclinical samples.
The esterase inhibitor bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) stabilizes abiraterone acetate and abiraterone as well.
Therefore, we investigated whether the esterase inhibitor BNPP could stabilize abiraterone in fresh human plasma.
