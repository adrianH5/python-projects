A significant factor in cancer-related mortality in melanoma is the appearance of intrinsically aggressive distal metastases.
This recurrence frequently results from the awakening of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs).
One of the most puzzling clinical features in this disease is that DCCs rapidly develop into metastases in certain melanoma patients, while remaining inactive in others.
We have previously identified NR2F1 as a driver of dormancy, but the mechanisms underlying its regulation, particularly when DCC are "awakened", are poorly understood.
This study reveals that the growth factor Midkine (MDK) triggers a potent autocrine mechanism that deactivates NR2F1-dependent dormancy in DCC, ultimately favouring metastatic outgrowth.
The effect of MDK was found linked to deregulation of the p-p38/p-ERK ratio in DCCs, in a process that was partly ALK-dependent.
Supporting the physiological relevance of these data, MDK and NR2F1 were inversely correlated in DCCs in human lymph nodes (LN).
In this regard, we observed that human LN biopsies negative for metastasis carried higher percentages of the dormant MDK
