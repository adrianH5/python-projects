Diabetic macular edema (DME) affects millions worldwide.
Intraocular injections of expensive anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors associated with complications are standard therapy.
Lamivudine, an inexpensive oral drug, inhibits inflammasome activation, which is implicated in DME.
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared oral lamivudine to placebo for improving visual acuity in center-involved DME (CI-DME).
