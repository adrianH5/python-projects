The rapid proliferation of tumor cells increases oxygen demand, while the underdeveloped vasculature limits supply, leading to hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment.
This hypoxic condition is a hallmark of solid tumors and contributes to tumor progression, immune suppression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy.
