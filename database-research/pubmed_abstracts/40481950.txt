Head and neck cancers (HNC) are complex conditions that require multidisciplinary management, as they impact critical functions such as speech, swallowing, and often lead to visible disfigurement, profoundly affecting a patient's quality of life (QoL).
The combination of these factors along with the disease can significantly diminish the QoL, causing considerable anxiety and depression in these patients.
The purpose of this study is to assess depression and anxiety in patients who underwent surgery and radiotherapy for the management of HNC, by using a modified assessment scale.
