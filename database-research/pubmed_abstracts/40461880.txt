Multiple myeloma (MM) ranks second only to lymphoma among hematologic malignancies in terms of incidence.
Current treatment methods primarily rely on proteasome inhibitors (PIs) targeting the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS).
However, existing PIs regimens encounter several limitations, including severe adverse effects, rapidly developing resistance during treatment, and restricted therapeutic efficacy.
In light of this, our work aims to explore strategies to mitigate poor conditions.
We employed a systematic structural optimization process to design and synthesize the new compound BC12-3, based on prevailing PIs.
JFCR39 COMPARE analysis was used to assess cytotoxic activity against 39 characteristic cancer cell lines, and the IC
