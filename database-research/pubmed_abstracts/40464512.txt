It is well known that the microenvironment in which an immune response develops, generally pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, along with other overproduced biomolecules recognized by pattern recognition receptors, may promote the stimulation and differentiation of monocytes into macrophages with effector functions.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a fundamental role in cholesterol transport.
By contrast, its oxidized form (ox-LDL), which is overexpressed in conditions of obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation, has been associated with cardiovascular diseases.
Depending on the microenvironmental context, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) participates in various scenarios such as inflammation, anti-inflammation, and homeostasis.
Therefore, obesity-derived biomolecules such as LDL, ox-LDL, and PGE2 could induce the differentiation of immune cells into effector populations with either pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive profiles.
