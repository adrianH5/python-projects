Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a global public health problem affecting hundreds of millions of people and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality of liver cancer.
Exosomes originate from cells and their detection in biofluids provides valuable insights into cellular and tissue alterations, thus reflecting underlying pathological states.
The aim of this study was to provide exosomal RNA biomarkers of CHB and develop a machine learning model for the non-invasive diagnosis of CHB patients.
