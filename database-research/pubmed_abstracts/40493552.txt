After the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening significantly decreased in Minamisoma City, Fukushima Prefecture.
However, the long-term health effects of this decline in screening participation have not been quantified.
This study aims to construct a model to evaluate the impact of post-disaster decreases in CRC screening participation on population health.
