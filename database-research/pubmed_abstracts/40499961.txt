Symptom management is crucial in cancer care, yet patient symptoms are often overlooked in routine care.
There is some evidence that electronic symptom monitoring and management can improve patients' physical function, symptom control, quality of life and survival outcomes.
However, the evidence of the impact on survival outcomes in patients with advanced cancer is still limited and debated.
This study aims to conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial by a professional symptom management team to monitor and manage symptoms in advanced cancer patients via an electronic information systems for patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) system (WeChat mini-program) and to verify its effectiveness on improving overall survival.
