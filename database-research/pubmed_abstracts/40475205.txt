Green spaces have been recognized for their ecological services, including air purification and biodiversity protection, which contribute to the enhancement of life quality and well-being.
However, despite the surge in research evaluating the impact of blue-green spaces on health outcomes, we still lack a definitive understanding of how green and blue spaces affect human health outcomes.
To assess the impact of blue-green spaces on human health outcomes, we systematically summarized and evaluated the relationship between green and blue spaces and human health through an umbrella review of epidemiological meta-analyses up to the year 2024.
