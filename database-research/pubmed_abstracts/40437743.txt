Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2; also known as HER2) expression is observed in 25-40% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), yet there are no anti-HER2 therapies under evaluation for HNSCC, as conventional cytostatic anti-HER2 antibodies have had limited effectiveness and levels of HER2 overexpression are lower in HNSCC tumors compared to breast cancer.
Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd; Enhertu) is a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprising an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable linker, and a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, and has shown promising results in very low HER2-expressing tumors.
We compare the efficacy of T-DXd, trastuzumab-emtansine (ADC comprising an anti-HER2 antibody and microtubule inhibitor, T-DM1; Kadcyla) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy in HNSCC with low and absent HER2 expression in vitro and in vivo.
In vitro treatment of a low HER2-expressing human HNSCC cell line (FaDu) with T-DXd resulted in dose-dependent cell death (IC50 values of 9856 ng·mL
