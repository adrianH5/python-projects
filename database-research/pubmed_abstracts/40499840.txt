Extracellular vesicles, exosomes, have garnered significant attention in the field of cancer therapy, one of the world's deadliest diseases.
Exosomes from cancer cells participate in the development of cancer.
Inhibition of exosome biogenesis may be a promising way to combat cancer.
Numerous drugs and agents have been assessed to inhibit exosome biogenesis, release, and uptake, which are the main factors contributing to cancer progression.
Different drugs target several intracellular mechanisms to stop the exosome signalling pathway.
They affect various intracellular pathways; for example, they can disrupt the endosomal sorting complex or interfere with the intracellular trafficking of exosomes Furthermore, some of them suppress or modulate genes and proteins involved in exosome generation and release.
Exosome inhibition may also be associated with different side and non-targeting effects.
Pre-clinical studies show promising outcomes; however, some challenges need to be addressed in future studies.
This review describes the properties of exosome inhibitor agents, focusing on the specific pathways involved in exosome biogenesis, release, and uptake.
