Modifications to intended chemotherapy regimens may be due to various reasons and may impact patient outcomes.
Understanding which factors are associated with chemotherapy modifications can help inform treatment planning and improve cancer care.
We examined the association between patient/tumor factors and modifications to intended chemotherapy in women with Stages I-IIIA breast cancer who were treated at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Kaiser Permanente Washington from 2005 to 2019.
Modifications were defined as any dose reductions in the first cycle or throughout chemotherapy, regimen change, treatment delay (single delay >14â€‰days) or receiving fewer cycles of any drugs than expected.
We used generalized linear models of the Poisson family with a log-link function to calculate prevalence ratios (PRatios).
Of 9700 women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, 34.6% had chemotherapy modifications.
Selected results are shown: positive associations were observed with age (PRatio
