Proteogenomic analysis is applied to samples from the CALGB 40601 (Alliance) randomized neoadjuvant trial of trastuzumab, lapatinib, or the combination to identify biomarkers associated with pathological response status.
Absence of ERBB2 gene amplification and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein overexpression by proteogenomics is associated with non-pathological compete response (pCR) (p < 0.05), highlighting potential false positives from standard diagnostics.
Pathway analysis in proteogenomics-confirmed HER2+ samples identifies elevated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and WNT-Î²-catenin signaling in non-pCR cases before treatment.
Twenty-four pCR-associated proteins reproduce in a second proteomic dataset, and four (GPRC5A, TPBG, SP140L, and NEU1) are significant in a third.
A meta-analysis of ten diverse neoadjuvant anti-HER2 treatment regimens from four independent studies confirms that non-pCR cases express higher levels of mRNA for G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member A (GPRC5A, p = 0.0002) and trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG, p = 0.00008).
Thus, proteogenomic analysis identifies negative biomarkers for pCR and alternative plasma membrane targets for treatment-resistant HER2+ breast cancer.
This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00770809).
