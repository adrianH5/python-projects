Caring for pediatric acute leukemia (PAL) patients poses significant psychological challenges for family caregivers, impacting their well-being and caregiving capacity.
This multicenter study aimed to assess caregivers' perception of their caregiving role using the revised Caregiving Appraisal Scale (rCAS) and identify factors associated with negative and positive caregiving appraisals among caregivers of children with PAL.
