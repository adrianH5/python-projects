Cerebrovascular autoregulation (CVA) is a homoeostatic regulatory function to maintain constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in systemic blood pressure.
The CVA-based optimal mean arterial pressure (MAPopt) refers to the MAP level at which the CVA mechanism reaches its lowest degree of pressure passiveness, allowing for optimal autoregulation.
This study aimed to determine MAPopt by analyzing existing CVA data from patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
