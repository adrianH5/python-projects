Doxorubicin (Dox) is one of the most used drugs in the treatment of various cancers, but its cardiotoxicity limits its use.
The aim of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effect of the formulation d-limonene-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HβDL) on a murine model of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.
Mice were divided into groups: Control (NaCl 0.9 %), Dox (20 mg/kg), and Dox + HβDL (10 mg/kg).
Drugs were administered intraperitoneally once every five days.
