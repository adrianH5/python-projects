The number of irradiated cancer survivors is increasing; mainly for breast, prostate, head-and-neck, uterine and rectal cancers.
Due to multiple factors including life expectancy, increasing cancer incidence and intensive cancer treatment improvements, cancer re-irradiation is an increasing phenomenon.
Local recurrence of cancer after after definitive irradiation represents one of the most challenging therapeutic scenarios.
The goal is to deliver to a pre-irradiated volume, a high dose (achieving secondary local control) while sparing organs at risk from deleterious over-dose (side effects).
Among the different re-irradiation techniques, salvage brachytherapy (BT), due to its "Trojan horse" concept, delivers the dose directly inside the target volume with a sharp dose fall-off and low integral dose compared to external beam radiotherapy techniques.
GEC-ESTRO aims to report a narrative review of the literature for salvage BT-based cancer re-irradiation for the most frequent cancers (PubMed search key words: local recurrence treatment, re-irradiation, brachytherapy, breast, prostate, head and neck, uterine and rectal cancers).
GEC-ESTRO working group representatives reported for each anatomical site; recommendations for patient selection, oncological outcomes and toxicity for salvage BT.
Due to its unique physical properties in terms of dose distributions, BT represents a valuable treatment option for cancer local recurrence.
For all indications of salvage BT, patient selection is crucial.
Shared decision making with the patient about efficacy / benefit and all potential risks represents a key point of the therapeutic decision-making process.
