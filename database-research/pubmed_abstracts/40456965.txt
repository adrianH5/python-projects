Recent studies suggest links between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and elevated cancer risk, though mechanisms remain unclear.
A 2021 review by Hu et al.
found a dose-dependent increase in cancer risk among adults with at least one ACE.
However, individual risk varies by ACE type and cancer type.
For instance, childhood abuse or neglect may heighten cancer risk, while home environment ACEs may not.
Potential mechanisms include risky behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol use), altered healthcare engagement (e.g., cancer screenings), and biological pathways (e.g., epigenetic changes).
This review highlights current findings, research gaps, and implications for cancer prevention.
Comprehensive, trauma-informed strategies promoting Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs) are crucial for reducing cancer risk linked to ACEs in adulthood.
