Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths, driven by its invasive and metastatic nature.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are increasingly recognized as regulators of cancer progression, primarily through miRNA sponging and interactions with RNA-binding proteins.
Their dysregulation has been linked to the development of in various cancers.
The present study aimed to investigate the potential involvement of circSLC22A3 in the pathogenesis of ESCC.
