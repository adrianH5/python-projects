Rituximab (RTX) effectively manages myasthenia gravis (MG) by reducing relapse rates.
Anti-Rituximab antibodies can develop in autoimmune diseases and may lead to RTX resistance.
Although RTX infusions are increased, these antibodies do not influence the occurrence of adverse events.
We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate how anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) impact treatment efficacy.
