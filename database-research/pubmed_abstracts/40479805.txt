Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most dangerous cancer among gynecological tumors, which poses a significant threat to women's health worldwide.
5-methylcytosine (m5C) plays a significant role in regulating tumor development.
The RNA methyltransferase Aly/REF export factor (ALYREF) is one of the m5C-modified RNA-reading proteins.
Although it was reported that ALREF played a facilitating role in a variety of cancers, the mechanism of ALYREF in OC was unclear.
