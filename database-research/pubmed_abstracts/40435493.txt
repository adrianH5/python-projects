Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) constitute the most important precursors of oral cancer.
Histopathological examination of a biopsy from a clinically suspicious lesion is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of oral cancer.
Adjunctive techniques such as autofluorescence, toluidine blue (TB), and others have been evaluated among high-risk individuals such as chronic tobacco chewers or in patients with suspicious lesions.
However, evaluation of these noninvasive adjunctive techniques has not been performed in primary health care settings.
Since the first point-of-contact of individuals living in rural and semiurban areas are the primary health care workers, evaluation of these noninvasive adjuncts is likely to assist and strengthen the population-wide oral cancer screening in high-burden countries such as India.
