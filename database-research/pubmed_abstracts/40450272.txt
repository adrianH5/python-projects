Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a severe and irreversible heart disease characterized by dilated ventricles and decreased myocardial function.
DCM has a poor prognosis and a very low survival rate, with a 5-year mortality rate ranging from 15 to 50%, and is an important cause of sudden cardiac death and heart failure.
Genetic factors play important roles in the pathogenesis of DCM.
Mutations in the cardiac troponin T (tnnt2) gene represent an important subset of known pathogenic variants that bind to DCM.
However, few specific drugs are currently available to treat DCM caused by these gene mutations.
Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), the main active ingredient of Astragalus mongholicus BungeÂ (Huangqi), is widely used in China to treat cardiovascular diseases, including DCM.
This study explored drugs for the treatment of DCM caused by tnnt2a mutation and revealed the protective effect of APS on tnnt2a-mutant dilated cardiomyopathy.
