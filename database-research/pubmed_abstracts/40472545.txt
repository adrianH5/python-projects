Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the appendix are rare in children even though they are the second commonest gastrointestinal tumor next to lymphoma.
NENs are usually diagnosed incidentally in appendectomies done for appendicitis, occasionally resulting in a second operation to ensure adequacy of the management.
This case report is aimed at emphasizing the significance of subjecting any appendectomy specimen to histopathologic examination, irrespective of the indication for appendectomy.
