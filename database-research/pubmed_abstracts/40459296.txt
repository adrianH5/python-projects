Primary osseous sarcoma of the breast (POB) is exceedingly rare and aggressive.
Breast sarcomas account for <1% of breast cancers with osteosarcoma accounting for only 12.5% of all breast sarcomas.
The rarity of these cases affords for limited published literature and therefore demands a case-by-case examination for treatment.
Primary osseous sarcoma of the breast typically presents as a rapidly growing mass that tends to be heavily calcified.
Diagnosis should be completed based on current societal guidelines for breast cancer detection.
The minimum recommended therapy is early surgical intervention.
Osteosarcoma is resistant to radiotherapy; however, there has been some evidence for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Due to the scarcity of research to guide treatment, we recommend presentation of individual patients at a multidisciplinary tumor board to create a treatment plan on a case-by-case basis.
