We discuss a patient with a retroperitoneal mass demonstrating marked enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT and heterogeneous uptake of both 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATOC on PET/CT.
The postoperative pathologic diagnosis revealed an angiolipoma, a benign entity composed of mature adipocytes interspersed with capillaries and containing fibrin thrombi within the vessels.
This case underscores the positive uptake of angiolipoma on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT, which should be recognized as a crucial differential diagnosis.
