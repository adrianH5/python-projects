Air transport of FFPE cancer tissue samples led to increased DNA fragmentation, primarily due to radiation exposure rather than temperature changes or freeze-thaw cycles.
While overall degradation was minor, critical samples requiring high nucleic acid integrity may benefit from local testing or research.
Avoiding air transport could help mitigate potential risks and ensure reliable results.
