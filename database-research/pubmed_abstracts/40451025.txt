Microplastics (MPs), as emerging environmental pollutants, not only possess inherent toxicity but also adsorb or carry other hazardous substances, such as the carcinogen cadmium (Cd), leading to more complex public health issues.
Exposure to MPs and Cd has been shown to induce liver injury, with each pollutant triggering distinct toxicological pathways and pathological processes.
In this study, Cd and MPs were selected as "stressors" to simulate the transformation from inflammation to tumorigenesis, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), based on data from the
