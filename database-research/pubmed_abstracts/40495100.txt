Speed-of-sound (SoS) is a biomechanical characteristic of tissue, and its imaging can provide a promising biomarker for diagnosis.
Reconstructing SoS images from ultrasound acquisitions can be cast as a limited-angle computed-tomography problem, with variational networks being a promising model-based deep learning solution.
Some acquired data frames may, however, get corrupted by noise due to, e.g., motion, lack of contact, and acoustic shadows, which in turn negatively affects the resulting SoS reconstructions.
