The gut microbiome, sometimes referred to as the "second brain," the "lost organ," the "identification card of the individual," and the "fingerprint of the host," possesses diverse traits and functions that influence health.
The impact of gut commensal bacteria on health, as opposed to environmental pathogenic factors, has generated increasing interest in recent years, culminating in a substantial body of study.
Research indicates that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is commonly observed in chronic inflammatory diseases, including colitis, obesity/metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, liver infections, allergic conditions, cardiovascular diseases, COVID-19, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders.
The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics has recently refined the theory of complementary and synergistic synbiotics.
In recent years, the field of microbiome research has been significantly advanced by technological developments such as massive culturomics, gnotobiotics, metabolomics, parallel DNA sequencing, and RNA sequencing.
This review article examined the potential next generation probiotics (NGPs) and explored some of them, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Akkermansia muciniphila, Parabacteroides goldsteinii, Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium hallii, Roseburia intestinalis, Christensenella minuta, Prevotella copri, and Oscillospira guilliermondii.
In addition to these useful probiotic strains, psychobiotics, members of the families of Lactobacilli, Streptococci, Bifidobacteria, Escherichia, and Enterococci, have extended applicability in the use for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.
The article also reviewed current trends and limitations in NGPs to enhance our comprehensive understanding of key concepts associated with the consumption of probiotics and proposed necessary initiatives for researchers to engage in collaborative translational research as future therapeutic solutions.
