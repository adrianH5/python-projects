Despite modern advances in neurosurgery, treatment of intramedullary spinal cord tumors is still associated with postoperative neurological impairment and high incidence of adverse outcomes.
Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring allows real-time functional assessment of spinal cord conduction pathways and accurate tumor resection.
Currently, concomitant monitoring of somatosensory and motor evoked potentials, as well as D-wave is the most common.
This excludes damage to both sensory and motor pathways.
In modern literature, there are some differences in methods of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, such as sensitivity and specificity of the method, criteria of «alarm» during surgical treatment of intramedullary tumors and correlation of neurophysiological monitoring parameters with postoperative neurological status of patients.
