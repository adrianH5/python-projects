Radiotherapy (RT) can stimulate anti-cancer T cell responses, and cytokines, notably interleukin-2 (IL-2), are necessary for optimal T cell function and memory.
However, timing and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) bias of IL-2 signals are ill-defined.
Using image-guided RT in a mouse colon cancer model, we observed single high-dose (20 Gy) RT transiently upregulated IL-2RÎ± (CD25) on effector CD8
