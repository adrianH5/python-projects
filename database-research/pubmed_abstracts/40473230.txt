This secondary analysis of three xxxxx head and neck cancer chemoradiation trials investigates feeding tube utilization up to nine years after treatment completion and attempts to identify predictive factors.
Oropharynx cancer patients treated with 3D conformal radiation (3DCRT) with accelerated fractionation and concurrent chemotherapy had higher rates of long-term feeding tube utilization than those treated with 3DCRT conventional fractionation.
However, when evaluating all patients treated (oropharynx and other subsites), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) had a protective effect, with significantly fewer long-term feeding tubes when compared to those treated with 3DCRT.
For most oropharynx cancer patients, neither IMRT technique nor accelerated fractionation nor addition of cetuximab influenced the likelihood of long-term feeding tube usage.
Most predictors of long-term feeding tube usage are patient factors known prior to treatment initiation.
