Head and neck radiotherapy quantitatively and qualitatively compromises salivary flow, and salivary substitutes have the potential to alleviate the symptoms.
This study aims to assess the effectiveness of two salivary substitutes in relieving symptoms of radiotherapy-induced xerostomia through a double-blind randomized controlled trial.
Twenty-four patients were selected from a dental oncology clinic and randomly assigned to the over-the-counter or compounded mouthwash group.
Each patient was instructed to rinse their oral cavity with the assigned solution three times a day for 30 days.
Both participants and researchers were blinded to the product used during the trial.
The impact of xerostomia was assessed using a numerical rating scale and validated questionnaires on oral health-related quality of life and xerostomia, administered before and after the intervention and subsequently compared.
Both groups exhibited a statistically significant reduction in xerostomia symptoms.
The studied salivary substitutes produced transient beneficial effects on complaints of radiotherapy-induced xerostomia.
