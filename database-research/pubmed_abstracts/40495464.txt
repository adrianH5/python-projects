Protein misfolding and conformational instability drive protein conformational disorders, causing either accelerated degradation and loss-of-function, as in inherited metabolic disorders like lysosomal storage disorders, or toxic aggregation and gain-of-function, as in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Classical homocystinuria (HCU), an inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism, results from cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency.
CBS regulates methionine conversion into metabolites critical for redox balance (cysteine, glutathione) and signaling (H
