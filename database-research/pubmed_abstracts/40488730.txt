The Nurses' Cancer Pain Management Competency Scale (NCPMCS) is a tool to explore nurses' competencies and subjective experiences in cancer pain management, and to help nurses understand their current shortcomings in cancer pain management in medical oncology departments.
In the hypothesis that cancer pain is not a problem exclusively specific to the oncology context, we tested the psychometric characteristics of the scale on the general Italian nurses population.
