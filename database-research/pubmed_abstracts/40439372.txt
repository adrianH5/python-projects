Malignant Fungating Wound (MFW) has a significant role in increasing quality of life.
The secondary infection could cause as well as Hemorrhage, Odor, Pain, Exudate & Superficial infections (HOPES) and reduced activity.
Worseness of MFW could be caused by a combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial infections.
This study aimed to prove the effectiveness of the topical antibiotic solution toward wound repairment secondary to MFW.
Methods: This study was a pre and post-test randomized controlled trial in which inclusion and exclusion criteria were predefined.
Patients who suffered locally advanced breast cancer were given chemotherapy and then randomized into the treatment group of MFW management treated with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole solution, and the non-treatment group treated with 0.9% NaCl.
The dependent variable was the number of Colony Forming Unit (CFU) and the degree of fibrosis.
Mann Whitney-U and Kendall's tau-b test was carried out to examine the difference and correlation test.
Statistical significance was defined as p <0.05.
