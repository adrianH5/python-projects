Pyrotinib has been extensively utilized in the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC), yet few reliable markers for predicting pyrotinib efficacy in these patients have been identified.
Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the predictive clinical factors for treating patients with HER2-positive ABC with pyrotinib.
To this aim, a prospective observational study was conducted on the prognostic potential of serum cytokines in a cohort of 58 patients with HER2-positive cancer receiving pyrotinib treatment, enrolled from January 2020 to December 2022.
Patients were treated with oral pyrotinib (400 mg/day, 30 min after eating) combined with capecitabine (1,000 mg/m
