Primary adrenal leiomyosarcoma and primary adrenal epithelioid angiosarcoma are exceptionally rare mesenchymal tumors of the adrenal gland.
Both typically present as unilateral, nonfunctional adrenal masses and may closely resemble other adrenal or metastatic tumors, thus making diagnosis challenging.
Immunohistochemical analysis is essential for accurate classification and clinical decision-making.
We report two primary adrenal leiomyosarcomas and one primary adrenal epithelioid angiosarcoma, all occurring in elderly female patients without initial evidence of extra-adrenal disease.
The leiomyosarcomas demonstrated spindle cell morphology with strong expression of smooth muscle markers and variable proliferative activity, including one patient that progressed to hepatic metastasis.
The epithelioid adrenal angiosarcoma exhibited epithelioid features, extensive necrosis, diffuse CD31 and ERG positivity, and focal keratin expression.
Complete surgical resection was achieved in all patients.
These patients highlight the diagnostic complexity and prognostic variability of adrenal sarcomas.
Documenting such rare tumors remains critical to improving diagnostic precision and guiding optimal management strategies.
