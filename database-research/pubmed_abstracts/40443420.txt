Progress in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) research is being slowed by the relatively small-scale studies being performed whose results are often not replicated.
Progress could be accelerated by analyses of large population-scale projects, such as UK Biobank (UKB), which provide extensive phenotype and genotype data linked to both ME/CFS cases and controls.
