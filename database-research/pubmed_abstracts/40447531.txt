Adjuvant high-dose-rate (HDR) vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) for endometrial cancer (EC) is delivered with vaginal cylinders ranging from 2.0 to 4.0 cm in diameter.
Dose heterogeneities as high as 170-210% can be observed with the narrowest 2.0 cm cylinders potentially increasing the risk of vaginal scarring.
Therefore, use of larger diameter cylinders is favored when clinically feasible.
Nonetheless, certain clinical scenarios necessitate the use of narrow cylinders despite their unfavorable dosimetry.
This study reports the clinical outcomes of EC patients treated with 2.0 cm diameter cylinders at a single institution.
