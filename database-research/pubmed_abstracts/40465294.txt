Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are efficacious in many cancer types but can produce immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
As such, patients with preexisting autoimmune disorders are often excluded from clinical trials, although subsequent studies have shown that many of these patients have acceptable ICI tolerance.
The safety and efficacy of ICIs among patients with preexisting neurologic autoimmune disorders (NAIDs) is not well characterized.
