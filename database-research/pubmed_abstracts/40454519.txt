Mild photothermal therapy (mild PTT) has emerged as a promising approach for tumor treatment that utilizes low-temperature photothermal effects to eliminate tumor tissue while avoiding thermal damage to the surrounding normal tissues.
However, its therapeutic efficacy is often limited by the upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which endow tumor cells with thermal resistance.
We have developed a multifunctional DNA-engineered iron single-atom nanozyme (Fe-N-C@DNA) to enhance mild PTT through a "minimize generation, expedite depletion" dual inhibition strategy.
The construct achieves gene silencing
