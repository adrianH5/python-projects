The incidence of young-onset cholangiocarcinoma (YOCC) is rising, yet the survival outcomes and metastatic patterns of metastatic YOCC (mYOCC) compared to metastatic average-onset cholangiocarcinoma (mAOCC) remain unclear.
This study evaluates differences in survival outcomes, metastatic patterns, and associated prognostic factors between mYOCC and mAOCC.
