Lung vasculature arises from both pulmonary and systemic (bronchial) circulations.
Remodeling and structural changes in lung vasculature have been recognized in end-stage fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) but have not been well characterized.
The vasculature that expands and supplies lung cancers is better described, with the recent recognition that systemic bronchial circulation expands to be the main blood supply to primary lung tumors.
Here, we use publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to compare vascular endothelial cell (EC) populations in multiple progressive interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to identify common and distinct features.
Lung tissue specimens were collected from healthy lung tissue (
