It has been hypothesized that inflammation and oxidative stress have a potential role in neurodegeneration.
Cisplatin is a commonly used in different types of cancers but it is notorious for oxidative stress which leads to neurodegeneration.
Therefore, the current study focused on the antioxidant effect of Calotropis procera during cisplatin treatment.
The methanolic extract of C. procera was extracted using rotary evaporator.
Memory impairment was evaluated by using Y-Maze and Morris water model.
The antioxidant effect of C. procera extract was measured by assessing oxidative stress markers such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) in the experimental groups.
It has been found that C. procera extract showed a significant (p<0.05) effect on preventing memory dysfunction compared to a positive control (cisplatin).
The effect of C. procera extract was observed in a dose-dependent manner.
Similarly, the increase (p<0.05) in the level of oxidative stress marker was high compared to the positive control group in a dose-dependent manner.
While the decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was found in the C. procera extract treated groups dose-dependently.
C. procera significantly reduces cisplatin-induced oxidative stress by restoring the level of antioxidant enzymes and reducing MDA levels.
The therapeutic benefits are significant at a dose of 400 mg/kg.
