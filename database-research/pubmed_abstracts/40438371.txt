Non - melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is a widespread malignant neoplasm affecting the skin globally.
In China, over the past 30 years, the prevalence and incidence of NMSC have changed significantly, yet mortality rate (MR) data is scarce.
The aim is to assess the MR data of NMSC patients worldwide from 1992 to 2021, analyze its temporal trends, and provide valuable epidemiological information for future prevention and management strategies of NMSC.
