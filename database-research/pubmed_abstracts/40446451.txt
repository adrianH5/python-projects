The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), a crucial regulator of systemic homeostasis, connects the brain and peripheral organs through complex neural circuits.
Often termed the "second brain," the gut responds to sympathetic innervation to coordinate physiological processes such as digestive motility, nutrient absorption, and immune surveillance, unveiling fundamental and potentially translational significance.
Therefore, timely exploration of sympathetic-gut communication is essential.
