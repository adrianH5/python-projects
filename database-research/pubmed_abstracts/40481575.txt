First Nations Australians experience poorer cancer outcomes than other Australians.
This is attributable to multidimensional factors, including disparities in access to cancer services and treatments.
Radiotherapy (RT) is an important component of cancer treatment yet evidence of its utilisation among First Nations Australians is limited.
We aimed to examine RT utilisation, time to the treatment, and associated factors in First Nations Peoples diagnosed with cancer in Queensland, Australia.
