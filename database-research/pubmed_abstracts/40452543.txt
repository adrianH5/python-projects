The modulation of double perovskites via a cation transmutation approach is a viable strategy to enhance their optoelectronic performance.
Here, we explored the cation transmutation approach by substituting Ag with Cu in double halide perovskites and investigated the role of Cu in X-ray detection performance.
We observe that Cu does not incorporate in a double halide perovskite structure (Cs
