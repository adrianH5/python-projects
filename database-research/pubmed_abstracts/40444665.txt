Awake surgery has become a crucial approach in glioma treatment, primarily aimed at maximizing tumor resection while preserving neurological functions.
While its application to the dominant hemisphere has been well established, its use in the non-dominant hemisphere remains underexplored.
The non-dominant hemisphere plays essential roles in visuospatial processing, social cognition, and executive functions, which can significantly impact a patient's quality of life.
Despite increasing evidence of these functions, standardized protocols for intraoperative brain mapping (ioBM) in the non-dominant hemisphere are lacking.
