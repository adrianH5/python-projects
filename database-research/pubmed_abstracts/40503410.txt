Neuroendocrine neoplasms are a group of tumors with heterogenous malignancy that evolve from neuroendocrine cells, most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract and in the lung.
The latest 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lung tumors defines neuroendocrine neoplasms of the lung as an independent group of tumors, including typical and atypical neuroendocrine tumors and small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.
Although the overall nomenclature is essentially unchanged from the fourth WHO classification, there are several clinically relevant updates.
In this review article, we discuss the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic features of these fascinating neoplasms, including the latest insights, current challenges and future perspectives.
