Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor dysfunction coupled with gastrointestinal disturbances.
Recent studies implicate the gut microbiome with the development of PD, yet pinpointing the exact microbial players is still to be determined.
This meta-analysis is the first to consolidate five homogenous case-control studies, covering the same variable regions of the 16S rRNA of 1007 fecal samples.
Utilizing our unified pipeline, we identified several key players potentially contributing to PD.
Our findings reveal higher microbial diversity characterized by elevated levels GABA consuming species particularly Evtepia gabavorous, contributing to neuronal excitability.
We also report the abundance of the proinflammatory Klebsiella variicola and the H
