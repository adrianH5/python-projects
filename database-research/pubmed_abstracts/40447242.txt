Chronic non-cancer pain drives many to seek complementary and alternative medicine, yet its usage remains poorly understood.
This study aimed assessing trends in complementary and alternative medicine use and its association with conventional healthcare use among chronic non-cancer pain individuals.
It is a repeated cross-sectional study using population data (≥16 years) from the Danish Health and Morbidity Surveys (2000, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2017, 2021; n=86,052).
The surveys' questions on complementary and alternative medicine types (ever use; 12 months use) and chronic non-cancer pain (≥6 months) were linked to information from the Danish National Health Service Register.
Results showed an increase in 12-month complementary and alternative medicine use from 29.9% in 2000 to 35.8% in 2010 among chronic non-cancer pain individuals, and from 19.4% to 23.1% among those without chronic non-cancer pain.
Between 2010 and 2017, a stagnation was observed, followed by a decrease in 2021 (31.0% among chronic non-cancer pain individuals and 20.6% among those without).
Massage and other manipulative therapies were the most frequently used among chronic non-cancer pain individuals, with the 12-month prevalence increasing from 16.7% in 2005 to 25.0% in 2010 and then remaining stable.
Complementary and alternative medicine users with chronic non-cancer pain had more GP consultations, visits to physiotherapists, and chiropractors within the past 12 months compared to those not using complementary and alternative medicine and without chronic non-cancer pain.
In conclusion, complementary and alternative medicine may aid chronic pain management, but further research is needed for safe integration into healthcare systems.
PERSPECTIVE: There is a high prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, alongside conventional care among individuals with chronic non-cancer pain.
CAM's effects and potential role in chronic pain management deserve further exploration to assess the potential for safe and effective integration with conventional treatments.
