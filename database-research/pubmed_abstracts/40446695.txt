Previous scholarly research highlights the indispensable roles of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and exosomes in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
However, the nuanced molecular mechanisms by which tumor-derived exosomal lncRNAs interact with TAMs to modulate macrophage polarization and HCC proliferation remain largely obscure.
