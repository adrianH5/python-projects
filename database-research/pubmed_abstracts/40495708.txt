IntroductionCardiovascular disease may develop in association with cancer treatment.
Pharmacists are involved in the care of patients requiring cardio-oncology services, but the efforts made and the challenges experienced by pharmacists are unclear.MethodsThe 61 pharmacists affiliated with the Japanese Onco-Cardiology Society (JOCS) were surveyed through a Google Forms questionnaire about their efforts and challenges in cardio-oncology, as well as their education and research motivation.ResultsTwenty of the 61 pharmacists responded to the survey.
The cardiovascular adverse events that required the most caution for 85% of respondents were cancer treatment-related cardiac dysfunction and heart failure.
A particularly common specific approach of pharmacists was to suggest echocardiography and electrocardiography before and during treatment.
Of the identified challenges in cardio-oncology, the lack of a follow-up system for late toxicity, and lack of pharmacists' knowledge of cardio-oncology, were reported.
Scientific conferences were the most used to learn about cardio-oncology.
As requests for learning content, the respondents indicated that seminars for pharmacists in the fields of oncology and cardiovascular disease should be held and books should be produced, a study group of pharmacists established, and a platform for sharing information created.
Ninety percent of respondents institutions were conducting cardio-oncology research.
Additionally, all respondents were interested in pharmacist-initiated multicenter trials.ConclusionsJOCS member pharmacists were found to be actively involved in the management of cardiotoxicity associated with cancer treatment.
This study suggests that pharmacists' activities contribute to the improvement of cardio-oncology.
