Offering evidence-based parenting interventions to caregivers virtually has the potential to increase the reach and public health impact of interventions.
As virtual adaptations to evidence-based interventions increase, attention must be paid to implementation fidelity, as high fidelity is associated with better program outcomes.
This study examined implementation fidelity of a virtual adaptation of the family-based Guiding Good Choices program delivered to 292 families in primary care in three large healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Attendance, dosage, adherence, quality of delivery, and participant engagement were examined quantitatively and qualitatively using interventionist and observer surveys, attendance records, and focus groups with interventionists.
Interventionists and observers reported high levels of dosage, adherence, quality of delivery, and participant engagement, but attendance was lower than anticipated.
Results suggest that delivering parenting programs virtually in primary care with high fidelity is feasible, but retaining participants may remain challenging in this modality, particularly during a global pandemic.
