Oral cancer is a leading cause of death in Pakistan, with a significant burden among rural populations.
The primary risk factor for oral cancer in this region is the widespread use of smokeless tobacco (SLT).
Despite international efforts to reduce tobacco consumption, SLT use remains prevalent.
This study aimed to explore the experiences of a rural population with SLT use.
