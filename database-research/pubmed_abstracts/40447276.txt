Differences in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between African and non-African populations have been reported.
Neutropenia has also been reported during rifamycin use.
ANC values in current tables that assign severity grades to clinical or laboratory events (The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS [DAIDS]) might not consistently be applicable among different populations.
