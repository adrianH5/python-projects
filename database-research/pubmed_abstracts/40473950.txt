Response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in metastatic melanoma (MM) varies among patients, and current baseline biomarkers predicting treatment outcomes are limited.
As mitochondrial (MT) metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of host immune function, we explored the association of host MT genetics (MT haplogroups) with ICI efficacy in 1,225 ICI-treated patients with MM from the clinical trial CheckMate-067 and the International Germline Immuno-Oncology Melanoma Consortium.
We discovered and validated significant associations of MT haplogroup T (HG-T) with resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein-1-based ICI (both single-agent and combination) and have shown that HG-T is independent from established tumor predictors.
We also found that patients belonging to HG-T exhibit a unique nivolumab-resistant baseline peripheral CD8
