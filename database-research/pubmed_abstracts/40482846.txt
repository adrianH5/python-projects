This narrative review explores the influence of obesity on colorectal cancer, focusing on obesity-related factors, including chronic inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and gut microbiota imbalance, which collectively create a pro-carcinogenic environment that increases colorectal cancer risk and complicates treatment outcomes.
The findings indicate that obesity not only accelerates tumor progression but also presents challenges in colorectal cancer treatment, such as higher rates of surgical complications due to excess adipose tissue and altered pharmacokinetics that can reduce chemotherapy efficacy.
Nutritional and lifestyle interventions, particularly weight management and anti-inflammatory nutritional therapies, are highlighted as effective strategies to reduce colorectal cancer risk and support treatment in patients with obesity.
The study emphasizes the importance of personalized colorectal cancer treatment approaches for individuals with obesity and calls for public health policies targeting obesity prevention, which could significantly decrease colorectal cancer incidence and healthcare burdens associated with this high-risk population.
