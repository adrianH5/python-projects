Background Gastric carcinoma is the commonest upper gastrointestinal malignancy contributing to global burden of cancer morbidity and mortality.
Objective The objective is to study distribution of the gastric neoplasm according to age, sex, symptom, gross appearance, histological type and degree of differentiation.
Method This was a retrospective study done from January 2022 to December 2023 in the Department of Pathology, Dhulikhel Hospital - Kathmandu University Hospital (DH - KUH).
Relevant clinical data of the patients were obtained from the histopathological records of the patient from the pathology department and biopsies stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin were studied under the light microscope.
Result A total of 40 cases of gastric neoplasm were studied out of which 36(90%) were malignant and 4(10%) were benign epithelial tumors and precursor lesions.
Most frequent presentation was dyspepsia, abdominal pain, vomiting, dysphagia, anemia, anorexia and weight loss.
Male to female ratio was 1.4:1.
The age of the patient ranged from 33 to 89 years with mean age of 63.3 Â± 13.4 years.
Most common site of gastric neoplasm was pyloric antrum.
Ulceroproliferative growth was most common gross morphology.
Malignant neoplasm were more common.
Intestinal type adenocarcinoma consisted of 28 (70%) cases followed by diffuse type 6 (15%) and mixed type 1 (2.5%).
Diffuse adenocarcinoma was more common in females.
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was the most common differentiation.
Conclusion The present study provided a fair insight into the clinciopathological features of gastric neooplasm in our institution.
