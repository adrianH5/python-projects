Cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is often limited by its nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects, largely driven by oxidative stress and inflammation.
This study evaluates the protective effects of irosustat, the steroidal bissulfamate STX140, and a sulfonate derivative (1G) against cisplatin-induced organ toxicity in a rat model, with silymarin and losartan as reference standards.
Male Wistar rats (n = 5/group) received daily oral doses of the test compounds for two weeks, with a single intraperitoneal cisplatin injection (10 mg/kg) on day 7 to induce toxicity.
Biochemical, histopathological, and molecular analyses assessed renal and hepatic function, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, Nrf-2) via qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
Pre-treatment with each compound improved kidney and liver function, as evidenced by significant reductions in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and restoration of serum albumin levels.
Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were downregulated, correlating with histopathological improvements in renal and hepatic tissues.
Notably, STX140 co-treatment reduced the IC
