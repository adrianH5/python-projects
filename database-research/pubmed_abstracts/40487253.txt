Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, a major component of noncoding RNAs.
Previous studies have shown the oncogenic role of various lncRNAs.
This study aimed to explore the expression and prognostic value of ATB and SNHG16 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
