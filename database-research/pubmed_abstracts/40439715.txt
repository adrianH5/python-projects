Erectile dysfunction (ED) represents one of the most clinically significant and detrimental quality-of-life complications in prostate cancer (PCa) patients following treatment.
Different modalities are applied to improve and rehabilitate functional results, especially erectile function after radical prostatectomy (RP).
We aimed to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on postoperative erectile function in patients who underwent bilateral nerve sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
