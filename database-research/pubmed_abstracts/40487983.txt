Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue acquisition is the procedure of choice to obtain samples to diagnose pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions.
Previous randomized trials demonstrated that using stylets during the EUS-fine needle biopsy (FNB) technique does not improve the diagnostic yield.
However, little data exists regarding the role of stylet and suction in the core biopsy needle during EUS-guided tissue acquisition.
