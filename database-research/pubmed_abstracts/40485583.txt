Sickle cell disease (SCD) causes severe morbidity and early mortality, yet it varies phenotypically.
Both air pollution and SCD affect the cardiorespiratory, inflammatory, and endothelial systems; however, limited evidence exists on the effect of long-term air pollution exposure in SCD.
We hypothesized that annual ambient (outdoor) concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), particles with a diameter of 2.5 Î¼m or less, at a child's home would be significantly associated with worse clinical, laboratory, and stroke-risk imaging outcomes.
Patient data for this retrospective study were obtained from a cohort of children with SCD (from 2010 to 2019).
Annual PM2.5 exposure was estimated using remote-sensing air pollution datasets.
Statistical analyses employed fixed effects multivariable models, offering a robust approach to isolate the effect of PM2.5 exposure.
The final cohort included 1,089 children with SCD.
Higher annual PM2.5 concentrations were significantly associated with more annual hospital days, higher likelihood of hospitalization and abnormal stroke-risk screening, and elevated inflammatory markers.
Of note, hydroxyurea use mitigated the inflammatory response to PM2.5 but did not mitigate the effect of PM2.5 on clinical outcomes.
Importantly, the elevated stroke risk associated with PM2.5 exposure persisted, even among children receiving hydroxyurea therapy, highlighting a critical concern in pediatric SCD management.
These results underscore the clinical importance of addressing environmental factors for comprehensive SCD care.
