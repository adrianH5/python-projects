Loss of function in the chromatin remodeler CHD7 causes CHARGE syndrome, characterized by variable penetrance and diverse abnormalities.
However, establishing genotype-phenotype correlations has been challenging, as most CHD7 inactivating mutations are null alleles.
Through CHD7 missense variant analysis at potential phosphorylation sites, we identified T730 (T720 in mice) as a critical residue associated with pathogenesis.
Using a CHD7 T730 missense variant (Chd7
