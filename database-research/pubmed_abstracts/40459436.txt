Atypical endometriosis is a distinct subtype of endometriosis, characterized by specific histopathologic findings.
It is thought to be a precursor lesion to endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers, particularly clear-cell and endometrioid subtypes, analogous to endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia as a precursor lesion to endometrial cancer.
This review summarizes recent evidence regarding the pathogenesis of atypical endometriosis and progression to endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer and the diagnosis and management of atypical endometriosis.
