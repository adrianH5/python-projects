A common side effect from cancer and anti-cancer treatment is cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), a multifactorial syndrome characterized by the loss of bodyweight, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.
Recommended therapeutic options are multidimensional, including nutritional, pharmacological and exercise interventions.
A novel therapeutic approach is the use of low-load resistance training combined with blood-flow-restriction to the trained limbs (LL-BFR).
It has been shown to induce adaptations in muscle mass and strength despite low training load in various clinical populations and might be a suitable training modality for cancer patients suffering from CAC.
