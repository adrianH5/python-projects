Metal ions are widely adopted to potentiate oxidative damage-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) and regulate immune pathways.
However, current ion delivery platforms lack precise administration over distribution and retention time within the tumor microenvironment, leading to high systemic toxicity and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy.
Here, local electrochemical immunotherapy is developed by implanting a tumor microenvironment-activated Zn//MnO
