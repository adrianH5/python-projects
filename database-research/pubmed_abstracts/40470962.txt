Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a diverse group of viruses that infect human mucosal and cutaneous tissues, with a ubiquitous global distribution.
Several types are classified as high-risk due to their association with cervical, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers.
Given its widespread prevalence and the limitations of clinical surveillance, HPV is an ideal candidate for wastewater-based testing (WBT), as a way to characterize circulating HPV types.
Toward this goal, we utilized high-throughput Illumina-based amplicon sequencing targeting the conserved GP5+/GP6+ sites of HPV in wastewater samples collected from two urban treatment plants, two town sites, and three correctional facilities.
Larger population catchments displayed greater diversity of HPV types in wastewater compared to institutional settings, reflecting differences in community composition and exposure.
A total of 24 distinct HPV types were detected, all belonging to the alpha-papillomavirus genus, encompassing high- and low-risk types, types of unknown risk, and both cutaneous and mucosal types.
Among these were six vaccine-preventable types, including HPV-16 and HPV-18, as well as probably carcinogenic types not routinely monitored in clinical settings, such as HPV-67, HPV-69, and HPV-73.
These findings demonstrate the utility of WBT as a complementary tool to clinical testing, providing critical insights to inform cancer prevention strategies and evaluate the impact of vaccination programs.
