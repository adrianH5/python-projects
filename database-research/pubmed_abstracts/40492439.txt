Perineural invasion (PNI) frequently occurs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which correlates with poor survival and induces intractable pain and numbness.
There is no effective treatment for PNI or associated pain.
To gain a better understanding of PNI at the molecular and cellular level, we produced an orthotopic, syngeneic mouse model of PNI by inoculating mouse oral cancer cells into the infraorbital nerve (ION), a nerve that is susceptible to cancer invasion in patients with HNSCC.
Mice with PNI in the ION exhibited both evoked and spontaneous nociception and impaired oral function, mimicking human conditions.
PNI resulted in a drastic reduction in the proportion and altered mechanical thresholds in mechanically sensitive trigeminal neurons; axon and myelin abnormalities, as well as phagocytic cells, were observed.
The tumor bed is marked by CD4
