Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, characterized by a poor prognosis, particularly in advanced stages.
Emerging evidence has underscored the pivotal role of lipid metabolism in cancer progression, influencing tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance.
However, the potential of lipid metabolism-related genes (LMGs) as prognostic biomarkers in SKCM remains largely unexplored.
This study aims to investigate the functional roles and prognostic significance of LMGs in patients with SKCM.
