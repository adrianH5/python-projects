Liquid biopsy approaches, especially the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), are emerging as sensitive and reliable surrogates for tumor tissue-based routine diagnostic testing.
Here, we retrospectively analyzed serially collected plasma samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients obtained at first diagnosis to evaluate the added value of ctDNA analysis for detecting therapeutically relevant variants and determining the consequent clinical implications.
