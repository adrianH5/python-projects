Immunotherapy, especially anti-PD-1 antibodies (α-PD-1), has revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment.
However, the response rate of α-PD-1 for Gastric Cancer (GC) remains relatively low.
The acidic immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment (TME) greatly hinders the efficacy of α-PD-1.
Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting the acidic TME in GC are highly desired.
