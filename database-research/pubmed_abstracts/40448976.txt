Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed the phenotypic and functional diversity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), identifying specific populations that directly impact the antitumor response.
However, despite the recognition of TAMs as promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment, research is hindered by the lack of validated human preclinical models.
Here, we applied scRNA-seq to a 3D human cell-based model comprising tumor cell line-derived spheroids, cancer-associated fibroblasts and primary monocytes, a setup widely used in immuno-oncology research.
