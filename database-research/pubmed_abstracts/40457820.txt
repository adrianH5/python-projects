Nutritional management has proven to be significant in the treatment of cancer.
Nonetheless, studies have rarely conducted on outpatients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) currently.
Data of outpatients with GIST at our hospital from June 1, 2020, to August 1, 2022, were retrospectively analyzed.

Nutritional risk distribution was low in 60.12% (
