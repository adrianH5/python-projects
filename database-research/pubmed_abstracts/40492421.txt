Management of severe prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) following acute drug overdose presents a challenge to clinicians, as resulting ventricular dysrhythmias are rare but life-threatening.
This study aimed to identify which patients with severe QTc prolongation on presentation to the emergency department (ED) after overdose will develop ventricular dysrhythmias, death, cardiac arrest, the need for rhythm control, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation utilization.
