Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metabolic reprogramming playing a critical role in its progression.
Bile acid metabolism has emerged as a key pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis, yet its comprehensive role in HCC remains poorly understood.
This study aims to systematically investigate the dysregulation of bile acid metabolism in HCC and its clinical implications.
