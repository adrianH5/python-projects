Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the female genital tract are rare, comprising only 1-2% of gynecologic tumors, with ovarian neuroendocrine carcinoma (O-NEC) accounting for less than 1% of all ovarian cancers.
Despite its rarity, O-NEC is a highly aggressive tumor with poor prognosis and significant diagnostic complexity, warranting focused clinical attention and demand greater awareness to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
