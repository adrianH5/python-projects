Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used anthracycline antibiotic for the treatment of breast cancer, liver cancer, lymphoma, and other malignant tumors.
However, its clinical application is limited by the side effects and drug resistance.
Astragalus injection has been combined with DOX in the treatment of cancer, which improves the curative effect and reduces drug resistance.
This study investigated the interaction between DOX and Astragalus injection and elucidated the potential mechanism.
