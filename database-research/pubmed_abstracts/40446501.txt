Thirty-four persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pesticides, were comprehensively analyzed using GC-MS/MS across 260 samples.
The chromatographic analysis included hospital wastewater, effluent and influent from a wastewater treatment plant, coastal seawater, sediments, and marine biota, specifically seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from the Mahdia region, Tunisia.
Most target POPs were detected in all matrices.
Total PCBs, PAHs, and pesticides were found at higher levels than in previous studies, with concentrations ranging from 0.073 to 480.660 mg/L in water samples and from 0.089 to 129.120 mg/kg in sediment and biota samples.
The most abundant organic compounds were the pesticides alachlor and omethoate.
The detected values in mussel samples indicate no immediate risk to human health, as they remain below established safety limits.
However, further analysis using the incremental lifetime cancer risk model revealed that certain compounds including PCBs, benzo[a]anthracene and Acephate exceeded acceptable threshold values.
Further investigation is necessary due to the ongoing discharge of wastewater into the environment and the limited efficiency of wastewater treatment.
