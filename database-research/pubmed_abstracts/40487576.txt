Patients with glioblastoma experience high physical and psychosocial symptom burden.
Poor social relationships have been shown to increase the risk of neurologic illnesses and decline, and conversely, strong personal social networks (PSN) have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality and improve quality of life.
The aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of measuring PSN in glioblastoma patients.
