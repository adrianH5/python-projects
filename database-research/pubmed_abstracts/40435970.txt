In a previous study, we developed a chromatin homology profile (CHP) method using the mathematical concept of homology and an analysis application, "Cell Checker", to differentiate histological types of lung cancer in respiratory cytology.
However, issues such as the analyzed field of view and data volume arose because the CHP method is based on images taken with a 100× objective lens.
In this study, to overcome these challenges, we investigated the accuracy of the CHP method for differentiating histologic types of lung cancer using images obtained with a 40× objective.
