Cationic polymers are positively charged polymers that have a high ability to electrostatically interact with negatively charged species, including nucleic acids.
This property has led to the use of these polymers in various fields, including targeted drug delivery.
In this study, biocompatible polyspermine-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-glucose (PSPG) nanoparticles were synthesized for DNA delivery to MCF-7 cells.
Structural characterization was performed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (
