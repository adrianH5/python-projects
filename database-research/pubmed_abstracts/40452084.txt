Background In tropical countries like Nepal, the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded within a population already grappling with various tropical infectious diseases.
Co-infection with malaria and dengue holds clinical significance when managing COVID-19 patients in regions endemic to these diseases.
Objective To identify malaria and dengue infections in febrile or symptomatic patients suspected of COVID-19 at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu.
Method Over two months, a prospective study was conducted on febrile or symptomatic patients suspected of COVID-19 visiting Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu.
One hundred and twenty-three patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR as well as for malaria and dengue infection using rapid diagnostic test kits.
Result Out of 123 patients suspected of COVID-19, 64 were confirmed to have COVID-19.
No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria co-infection was found among the 123 tested patients.
However, two patients admitted for COVID-19 tested positive for dengue virus infection.
The patients with co-infections with dengue or scrub typhus were likely to have a longer hospital stays (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 0.22-29.26), though lacking a significant association.
Conclusion The two patients diagnosed with dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 were identified during their hospital visit and both recovered after receiving treatment.
Given that COVID-19 patients manifest symptoms resembling many tropical infectious diseases, the study underscores the clinical importance of testing for multiple circulating infections in patients from endemic areas.
This approach ensures appropriate and timely management reducing the risk of severity or mortality.
