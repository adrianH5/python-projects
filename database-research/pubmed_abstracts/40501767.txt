Resistance to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies, such as enzalutamide, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a significant clinical challenge, often driven by mechanisms including lineage plasticity.
The precise molecular mechanisms driving this process, particularly downstream effectors, remain incompletely understood.
Given its established roles in cell fate and stemness, alongside its complex functions in prostate cancer, the Notch signaling pathway presented a compelling focus for study.
This study investigates the role of Notch signaling in mediating lineage plasticity and therapeutic resistance in CRPC.
Employing transcriptomic analysis and functional assays, we identified Notch activity is elevated across prostate cancer progression resistance.
Notably, both CRISPR-mediated knockout and targeted inhibition of Notch reversed enzalutamide resistance
