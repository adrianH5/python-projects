Esophageal cancer (EC) is the ninth most common cancer worldwide that kills about 300,000 people each year.
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the main type of EC.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to be severely dysregulated in EC, but the functions of more lncRNAs still need to be explored.
