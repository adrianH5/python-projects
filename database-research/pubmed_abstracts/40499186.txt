PurposeIncisional hernia (IH) is a common postoperative complication after abdominal surgery, but its predictors and impact on prognosis remain unclear in gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) cancer patients.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 505 patients who underwent elective tumor resection for GI and HPB malignancies at two institutions (2018-2021).ResultsThe overall incidence rate of IH within 2Â years after surgery was 15.6% (79/505).
