The present study focuses mainly on the extraction of C-Phycocyanin (CPC) pigment from cyanobacteria, its optimization and evaluation of its radical scavenging and antiproliferative abilities.
Optimization of the pigment production was conducted both experimentally and statistically by response surface methodology (RSM).
Quadratic models were fitted to the responses obtainedÂ from the box-Behnken design (BBD), to examine the interactions among Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphate, pH and Temperature, and their impact on pigment production.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) validated the model,revealing that higher levels of carbon, nitrogen and phosphate significantly influenced (
