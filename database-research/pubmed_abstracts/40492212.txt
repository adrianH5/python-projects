Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), being more prevalent in developing countries due to the intake of chewable tobacco, is treatable if patients present at an early stage.
According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, T4b disease is termed inoperable and treated with palliative intent.
However, with the passage of time, these have been operated on, with comparable disease-free survival rates with T4a disease.
On radiological investigation, the mandibular notch is a structure dividing the infratemporal fossa into two.
The objective is to determine the frequency of supra-notch and infra-notch T4b OSCC tumours and to compare them with surgeons' perspective in terms of operability.
