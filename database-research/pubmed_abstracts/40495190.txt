Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity is a central component of inflammatory and innate immune responses, which plays a crucial role in sepsis.
The inhibition of NF-κB signaling and the IκB kinase (IKK) complex is important for understanding the control of innate immunity and regulating the progress of sepsis.
