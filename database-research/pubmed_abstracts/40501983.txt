Multicellular organisms constantly encounter biotic and abiotic stressors that threaten to disrupt their homeostasis.
To counteract this, they have evolved a series of conserved defense networks which monitor organellar function and the accumulation of aberrant molecular signals.
As mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to a variety of pathologies, including metabolic impairment, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and sensitivity to bacterial infections, understanding these mitochondrial surveillance pathways is crucial.
Previous research in our lab established that one such pathway, the Ethanol Stress and Response Element (ESRE), was activated by a broad range of stresses, including exposure to the Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen
