Metastasis formation poses a significant challenge to oncologists, as it severely limits the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
Recently, we demonstrated that CD44 promotes spontaneous distant metastasis in a CRC xenograft model.
The depletion of CD44 was associated with reduction in hypoxia, EMT, as well as improved mitochondrial metabolism in primary tumor.
Collectively, these effects decreased the metastatic potential of the CRC xenograft tumors under investigation.
In this study we explore the molecular mechanisms by which CD44 knockdown (kd) leads to such substantial changes of tumor properties.
