Platycodin D (PCD) is a saponin extracted from the roots of Platycodon grandiflorum (Jacq.)
A.
DC., a medicinal plant used in Eastern traditional medicine for many years.
PCD is known to exert anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-obesity effects, and its preventive effects on cardiovascular disease, including anti-arteriosclerosis properties are being explored.
This study examined the protective effects of PCD against endothelial dysfunction in EA.hy926 endothelial cells, particularly in the context of nitric oxide (NO) production mediated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.
The effects of PCD on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-triggered endothelial dysfunction were examined using MTT and lactate dehydrogenase, quantitative PCR, western blotting, monocyte adhesion, immunofluorescence, intracellular Ca
