Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis, despite the emergence of chemotherapies such as gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel, AG), unmet medical needs still exist for patients with metastatic PDAC (mPDAC).
Surufatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R).
This single-center, retrospective study evaluates the potential efficacy of combination therapy containing Surufatinib in advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
