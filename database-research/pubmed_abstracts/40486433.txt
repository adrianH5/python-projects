Malignant tumors of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract are a common cause of GI bleeding, often presenting therapeutic challenges due to diffuse hemorrhage and poor visualization.
Local hemostatic agents, such as TC-325 (Hemospray; Winston-Salem, NC: Cook Medical), have emerged as effective bridging therapies prior to definitive treatment.
However, visceral perforation, though rare, is a serious complication associated with TC-325 use.
We present a case of an 87-year-old male with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma who experienced visceral perforation following TC-325 application for recurrent upper GI bleeding.
Despite achieving initial hemostasis, the patient succumbed to complications of perforation.
This study highlights the need for caution when using TC-325 in patients with advanced malignancies and friable tissue.
