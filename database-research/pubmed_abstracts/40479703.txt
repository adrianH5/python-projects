Nitrogen mustards are a family of clinically used anticancer drugs that contain a DNA-alkylating bis(2-chloroethyl)amino group.
Appending the bis(2-chloroethyl)amino alkylating agent to noncovalent DNA-binding groups such as intercalators, polyamides, or polyamines has the potential to yield DNA-targeted anticancer agents with improved potency.
In the work reported here, substituted quinoxaline groups were explored as minimal intercalators expected to confer noncovalent DNA-binding properties on a bis(2-chloroethyl)anilino mustard alkylating unit.
A quinoxaline unit with a cationic dimethylamino-containing side chain was found to be a more potent DNA-alkylating and cross-linking agent than the clinically used mustard chlorambucil (
