Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is portrayed as an advantageous enteric bacterium with a particular property of mucin utilization.
Emerging data suggest A. muciniphila can reshape gut chronic inflammation, enhance intestinal epithelial tight junctions, and sensitize toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 to restrain the infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages.
As well, analogous role is detected in surface A. muciniphila-coated pili, outer-membrane protein Amuc_1100, Î²-galactosidase enzyme Amuc_2172, and extracellular vesicles.
We rendered insights into empirical evidence on molecular mechanisms mediated by A. muciniphila in inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal cancers which include colitis-associated colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer.
We discussed its potential preventive and therapeutic benefits on immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy.
A. muciniphila supplementation through diet, probiotics-prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and certain drugs, would be a promising therapeutic strategy.
Nevertheless, data profiles decipher A. muciniphila is linked to multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease occurrence and evolvement.
Thus, how to avoid the deleterious effects triggered by A. muciniphila warrants further exploration.
It ought to be considered to conduct a critical and cautious analysis of the next-generation beneficial microbe manipulation ahead of clinical application.
