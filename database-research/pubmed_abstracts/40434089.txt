BackgroundA non-invasive and reliable method is essential for diagnosing sub-1 cm thyroid lesions.ObjectiveWe have developed a nomogram that integrates ultrasound features and clinical risk factors to effectively diagnosed sub-1 cm thyroid lesions.MethodsOur study included 406 patients with sub-1 cm thyroid lesions.
We collected their demographic data and ultrasound characteristics of the thyroid, followed by conducting univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the risk factors.
Subsequently, we developed a nomogram for predicting sub-1 cm thyroid lesions, comparing its diagnostic performance with that of American College of Radiology TIRADS (ACR TI-RADS) and Chinese Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (C TI-RADS).ResultsSix variables, including female gender, capsular invasion, solid composition, aspect ratio >1, irregular margin and microcalcification, were identified as potential predictors and used to develop a predictive nomogram.
Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and compared with ACR TI-RADS and C TI-RADS classifications.
The area under the curve of the nomogram was found to be at 0.85, while the AUC of ACR TI-RADS classification and C TI-RADS classification were at 0.771 and 0 .736 respectively.ConclusionsBy utilizing this user-friendly nomogram, the likelihood of sub-1 cm malignancy in thyroid lesions can be objectively quantified.
