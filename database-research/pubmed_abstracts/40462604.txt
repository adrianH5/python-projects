In this issue of MCT, three articles from the NCI's Preclinical Chemoradiotherapy Testing Consortium (PCRTC) are presented that each demonstrates a story of success.
Each cooperative agreement team's results are briefly summarized, and both the importance and the limitations of these studies are discussed.
These preclinical studies used agents from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program portfolio to develop the foundation for translation into clinical trials.
The structure of these studies was based on the prior work of the PCRTC that laid out the methodology for optimizing potential translation.
Rigor and reproducibility have been a continuing focus of the PCRTC, with a key feature being the requirement for dose measurement and calibration to be traceable to national standards.
Through the application of the consortium's prior work establishing the standards for translation, each group generated promising data with high translational potential.
