Bronchopulmonary carcinoids are rare neuroendocrine tumors, categorized as either typical (low-grade malignancy) or atypical (intermediate-grade malignancy), with an incidence of approximately 0.5 per 100000 people.
One third of patients remain asymptomatic, while others may present with symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, and recurrent infections, often resulting from bronchial obstruction.
Endocrine syndromes, like carcinoid- or Cushing syndrome, are rare in pulmonary carcinoids.The prognosis of these tumors largely depends on histological classification and disease stage at diagnosis.
Typical carcinoids, which are less aggressive, show higher 5- and 10-year survival rates compared to atypical carcinoids.
Diagnostic factors such as tumor size, chromogranin A (CgA) levels, and clear differentiation from other lung pathologies, including carcinomas and metastases, are essential for accurate diagnosis and therapy planning.Due to the rarity of carcinoids, treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach.
Surgical resection remains the preferred therapy for localized carcinoids, offering the potential for prolonged survival.
Early detection and complete tumor removal are crucial to optimizing outcomes and minimizing the risk of recurrence.
