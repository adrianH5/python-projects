Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and difficult-to-treat brain cancer that resists conventional therapies.
Recent advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy have shown promising potential for treating glioblastoma; however, achieving optimal efficacy remains challenging due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, and T-cell exhaustion.
In this study, we developed a mathematical model of CAR T-cell therapy for glioblastoma to explore combinations of CAR T-cell treatments that take into account the spatial heterogeneity of antigen expression.
Our hybrid model, created using the multicellular modeling platform PhysiCell, couples partial differential equations that describe the tumor microenvironment with agent-based models for glioblastoma and CAR T-cells.
The model captures cell-to-cell interactions between the glioblastoma cells and CAR T-cells throughout treatment, focusing on three target antigens: IL-13R
