Third molar extraction, a common dental procedure, often involves complications, such as alveolar nerve injury.
Accurate preoperative assessment of the extraction difficulty and nerve injury risk is crucial for better surgical planning and patient outcomes.
Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have shown the potential to enhance the predictive accuracy using panoramic radiographic (PR) images.
This systematic review evaluated the accuracy and reliability of DL models for predicting third molar extraction difficulty and inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injury risk.
