Recent large-scale genomic sequencing studies reveal that 5-18% of children with cancer harbor pathogenic variants (PV) in known cancer predisposing genes (CPG).
However, DNA damage repair (DDR) genes, which are frequently somatically altered in pediatric tumors, have not been systematically examined as a source of novel cancer predisposing signals.
