Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome (SVCS) is any occlusion of the SVC, resulting in venous blood backup.
Common causes of SVCS include mediastinal tumors and, less frequently, implanted venous devices.
Understanding collateral venous formation in SVCS is crucial for identifying alternative pathways for venous return and alleviating symptoms of venous obstruction.
The SVC, formed by the anastomosis of the right and left brachiocephalic veins, drains blood from structures above the diaphragm into the right atrium.
Here, we provide a unique postmortem analysis of SVCS and collateral venous formation to support clinical identification and treatment.
A 48-year-old cadaver with a limited medical history of metastatic rectal cancer was dissected in an anatomy course.
The SVC was observed to be occluded in its entirety.
The likely cause of SVCS was mediastinal tumors.
Vessel dilation was observed within the azygos system, intercostal, right thoracic-epigastric, inferior epigastric, and internal thoracic veins.
Collateral venous formation was found by way of the azygos and hemiazygos veins, which joined inferiorly to form a single vessel draining into the inferior vena cava (IVC), and multiple left intercostal veins formed single communications with the azygos vein.
Recognizing this complex anatomy and patterns of the azygos venous system is crucial in understanding alternative blood flow pathways in cases of SVCS.
Variations in this system can form critical venous collaterals, bypassing obstructions and relieving venous congestion.
Although visualizing these collateral networks on imaging can be challenging, postmortem gross findings offer crucial insights into collateral formations and potential patterns in SVCS presentation.
Ultimately, detailed understanding and identification of azygos venous patterns improve patient safety, support accurate diagnosis, and optimize treatment outcomes across a range of medical and surgical disciplines.
