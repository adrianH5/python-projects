Endoscopic mastectomy has provided patients and surgeons with more favorable cosmetic outcomes as compared to standard mastectomy.
A major limitation is the increased operative time attributable to technical challenges faced by surgeons.
One such challenge faced by procedurists pertains to optimizing the view of the medial breast parenchyma after dissection past the vertex of the breast.
We report a technique termed Traction-Assisted Chest Elevation (TRACE) which involves placement of two tension sutures to apply anterior traction at the medial skin flap to optimize endoscopic views for this aspect of endoscopic mastectomy.
The optimized ergonomics and improved visualization allows more precise dissection and shortens operative time.
Use of TRACE resulted in a reduction of the operative time from an average of 133 min to 90 min.
TRACE is a novel technique for optimizing the intraoperative endoscopic view during endoscopic mastectomy and can potentially reduce overall operative time.
