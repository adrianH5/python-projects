Chromothripsis, the chaotic shattering and repair of chromosomes, is common in cancer.
Whether chromothripsis generates actionable therapeutic targets remains an open question.
In a cohort of 64 patients in blast phase of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (BP-MPN), we describe recurrent amplification of a region of chromosome 21q ('chr.
21amp') in 25%, driven by chromothripsis in a third of these cases.
We report that chr.
21amp BP-MPN has a particularly aggressive and treatment-resistant phenotype.
DYRK1A, a serine threonine kinase, is the only gene in the 2.7-megabase minimally amplified region that showed both increased expression and chromatin accessibility compared with non-chr.
21amp BP-MPN controls.
DYRK1A is a central node at the nexus of multiple cellular functions critical for BP-MPN development and is essential for BP-MPN cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and represents a druggable axis.
Collectively, these findings define chr.
21amp as a prognostic biomarker in BP-MPN, and link chromothripsis to a therapeutic target.
