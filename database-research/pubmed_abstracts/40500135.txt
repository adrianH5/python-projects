Tumor metabolic reprogramming, particularly the Warburg effect, is crucial for rapid tumor growth and immune evasion.
Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key enzyme in tumor aerobic glycolysis, is overexpressed in tumors and is considered an effective therapeutic target.
Sodium oxamate (SOM) is a classic LDHA inhibitor, but its poor cell permeability, low tumor killing effect, and ineffective immune activation limit its application.
Herein, SOM nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared via a thin-film hydration method for amplified cancer immunotherapy.
SOM NPs are efficiently taken up by tumor cells through endocytosis, releasing NH
