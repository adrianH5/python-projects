Antibiotics (ABX) have been linked to reduced survival in ovarian cancer (OC) when administered before or during platinum-based chemotherapy.
This study evaluates the impact of ABX, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), and steroids on progression-free survival (PFS) in OC patients receiving poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).
