Prenatal alcohol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), primarily through alcohol-induced apoptosis.
This study explores the link between ethanol-induced neuronal apoptosis and neural network electrical activity in developing rat retinal ganglion cells, and examines dopamine's protective effects and influence on this activity.
