Gastrojejunocolic fistula, a rare but serious complication of gastrojejunostomy often results from inadequate resection or incomplete vagotomy during gastric surgery.
The most common symptoms include feculent vomiting, chronic diarrhea, and weight loss, and surgical repair is the definitive treatment for this condition.
