Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 therapies, have revolutionized cancer treatment by harnessing the body's immune system to eliminate cancer cells.
Despite their considerable promise, the efficacy of ICIs significantly differs based on tumor types and specific patient conditions, highlighting the necessity for personalized approaches in the framework of predictive preventive personalized medicine (PPPM; 3PM).
