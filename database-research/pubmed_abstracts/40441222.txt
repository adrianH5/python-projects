Primary adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis is a rare malignant tumor, with approximately 100 cases reported in the English literature.
This malignancy is characterized by high-grade aggressiveness, diagnostic challenges at initial presentation, and advanced disease at diagnosis, leading to poor overall prognosis.
Historically, treatment has focused on surgical resection combined with chemotherapy, but documented cases remain scarce.
The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) necessitates the exploration of novel therapeutic combinations to improve survival outcomes.
We present a case of primary renal pelvic adenocarcinoma managed with a multimodal approach integrating radical surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and concurrent ICI therapy, resulting in prolonged survival.
