Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs) are widely abused substances that impair central and peripheral nervous system functions.
The mechanisms of their toxicity on human neuronal cells have not been fully clarified yet but include effects on oxidative-antioxidative balance and interaction with synaptic enzymes/receptors.
The aims of this study were to determine oxidant/antioxidant status, DNA integrity and the activity of neurotransmitter system components (monoamine oxidase A, MAO-A and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, nAChR) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells after 24-h exposure to different ATSs.
In this matter, we first evaluated cell viability by MTS assay.
After determination of the concentrations (near IC
