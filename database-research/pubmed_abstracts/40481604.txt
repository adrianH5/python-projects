Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a causative microorganism of febrile neutropenia (FN), accounts for approximately 15% of bloodstream infections and is associated with a high mortality rate.
Therefore, antibiotics with anti-P. aeruginosa activity should be administered appropriately during the initial treatment of FN.
While other countries have examined guideline adherence and its associated factors in FN initial treatment, limited data are available on these aspects in Japan.
This study aimed to evaluate adherence to FN treatment guidelines regarding antibiotics used in patients with cancer and identify factors associated with adherence using a Japanese health insurance claims database.
