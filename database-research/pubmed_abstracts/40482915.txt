Gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) represents a transformative tool in cancer therapy, offering specificity and reduced off-target effects compared to conventional treatments.
A crucial step in siRNA-based therapies is endosomal escape, the release of siRNA from endosomes into the cytoplasm.
Quantifying endosomal escape is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the process and limitations in imaging and analytical techniques.
Traditional methods often rely on fluorescence intensity measurements or manual image processing, which are time-intensive and fail to capture continuous dynamics.
This paper presents a novel computational framework that integrates automated image processing to analyze time-lapse fluorescent microscopy data of endosomal escape, hierarchical Bayesian inference, and stochastic simulations.
Our method employs image segmentation techniques such as binary masks, Gaussian filters, and multichannel color quantification to extract precise spatial and temporal data from microscopy images.
Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we estimate the parameters of a compartmental model that describes endosomal escape dynamics, accounting for variability over time.
These parameters inform a Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm, ensuring realistic simulations of siRNA release events over time.
By combining these techniques, our framework provides a scalable and reproducible method for quantifying endosomal escape.
The model captures uncertainty and variability in parameter estimation, and endosomal escape dynamics.
Additionally, synthetic data generation allows researchers to validate experimental findings and explore alternative conditions without extensive laboratory work.
This integrated approach not only improves the accuracy of endosomal escape quantification but also provides predictive insights for optimizing siRNA delivery systems and advancing gene therapy research.
