Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great potential as drug delivery systems in biomedical applications; however, the poor physiological stability of MOFs in phosphate-based media limits their practical biomedical applications.
Moreover, active-targeted delivery systems provide a more effective solution for developing precise personalized therapy regimes.
We created a physiologically stable, epitope-imprinted, and double-gated PCN-224(Zr
