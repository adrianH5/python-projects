Several studies have established that patients with localized perinatal neuroblastoma can be safely observed; however, long-term outcomes have not been previously reported.
We evaluated long-term outcomes of infants with suspected perinatal neuroblastoma enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ANBL00P2, which included an expectant observation approach.
Among 87 eligible patients, the 10-year event-free survival (EFS) was 93.7%, and overall survival (OS) was 98.0%.
Most tumors regressed spontaneously; only three patients reported progression to higher stage disease.
This report reinforces the long-term safety of non-interventional management in perinatal neuroblastoma, sparing infants unnecessary surgery and associated risks.
