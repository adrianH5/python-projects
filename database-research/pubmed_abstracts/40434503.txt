This study explores the current status, research hotspots, and emerging trends in AMP-induced cell death through bibliometric and data-driven visual analysis.
The findings aim to provide researchers and clinical professionals with new insights and potential research directions.
A total of 1,897 articles and reviews published between 2006 and 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection.
Bibliometric and visual analyses were conducted using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, Origin 2022, and WordClouds.
The analysis focused on publication trends, contributing institutions, journals, authors, cited references, and keywords.
China contributed the largest share of publications (28.15%).
The Chinese Academy of Sciences emerged as the most collaborative institution, demonstrating the highest centrality.
The author with the highest composite index was Chen, Jyh-Yih (2,985.27).
Recent research hotspots have centered on elucidating the mechanisms of AMP-induced cell death and exploring the potential applications of AMPs in cancer therapy.
Keywords such as anticancer peptides, mechanism, design, and antibiotic resistance currently dominate the field, reflecting its evolving focus.
Research on the application of AMPs in cancer treatment is gaining momentum.
The forefront of this field involves modifying and designing AMPs to address antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and advance cancer therapeutics.
However, further investigation is needed to uncover the specific molecular mechanisms underlying AMP-induced cell death, including necrosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis.
