ObjectiveTo investigate the application value of ultrasound artificial intelligence S-Detect technology in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast nodules.MethodsSuspicious breast nodules were examined using S-Detect technology, conventional ultrasound (US), and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).
The differential diagnoses were compared with final pathological results to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of these three techniques in distinguishing benign from malignant breast nodules.ResultsThe accuracy of S-Detect in diagnosing benign and malignant breast nodules was 0.859, with a sensitivity of 0.915, specificity of 0.839, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.877.
The value of AUC was significantly higher than that of US (0.727,
