Bone angiosarcoma (B-AS) is an exceedingly rare and aggressive vascular neoplasm, with limited therapeutic options and poor outcomes.
Unlike the more prevalent clinical subsets (breast, head and neck), the pathogenesis of B-AS remains poorly defined, with no targeted therapeutic strategies available.
Moreover, the often delays in diagnosis, either radiographically or pathologically, as well as the common multifocal presentation, further impact the feasibility of surgical management, contributing to lower survival rates.
In this study, we investigated the clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of B-AS to better define prognostic factors influencing outcomes.
