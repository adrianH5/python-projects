Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a life-threatening complication of chemotherapy.
Although practice guidelines suggest the use of existing prediction models when making decisions to prevent and treat FN, recent evidence suggests that these models are limited in their discriminative ability.
This study aims to systematically review and critically evaluate the recent literature to assess the question: what evidence-based clinical prediction models can be used to predict FN or its outcomes?
