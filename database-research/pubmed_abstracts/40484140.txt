Gastrointestinal (GI) clinicians are a critical touchpoint for individuals at risk for genetic and familial syndromes that increase risk of colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer.
While advances in sequencing technology and reduced costs have made genetic testing more readily accessible to clinicians and even to patients through direct-to-consumer testing, uptake of genetic testing remains underutilized.
This is a missed opportunity to identify patients and family members who could benefit from genetic testing to diagnose cancer susceptibility syndromes for which surveillance and preventive interventions exist.
Barriers for integration of genetic testing in routine practice include lack of awareness about genetic conditions by patients and providers, concerns about genetic testing costs and implications for insurability, as well as challenges in implementing algorithms for risk assessment and coordinated care in complex medical systems.
This review addresses current evidence and guidelines for cancer risk assessment, genetic testing and management to enable GI clinicians to identify and care for individuals with genetic cancer-predisposition syndromes in routine practice.
