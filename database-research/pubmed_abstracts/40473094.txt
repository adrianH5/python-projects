This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a traditional cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program compared to an augmented program that integrates traditional cardiac rehabilitation with face-to-face training sessions and remote assistance facilitated through an application based on the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) model for individuals undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
