The number of elderly patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly increasing worldwide.
Elderly patients with NSCLC are less suited to active treatment than younger patients.
Upfront dose reduction (UDR) of the first cycle of first-line treatment is sometimes chosen for elderly patients due to adverse events.
We investigated the clinical impact of UDR in elderly NSCLC patients.
