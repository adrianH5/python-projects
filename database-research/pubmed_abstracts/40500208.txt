A 66-year-old man was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with mediastinal emphysema after an abnormal chest X-ray during physical examination.
During hospitalization, an intestinal obstruction was observed to be caused by barium used during gastric cancer screening.
Colonoscopy demonstrated stenosis and perforation due to sigmoid colon diverticulitis.
Hartmann surgery was performed, and the patient was discharged on the 58th day.
Therefore, colon perforation should be considered as a cause of mediastinal emphysema, and organic stenosis may occur with intestinal obstruction caused by barium.
