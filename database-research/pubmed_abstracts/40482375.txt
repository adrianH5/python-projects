Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options and poor survival outcomes.
Lurbinectedin has been approved for the post-platinum setting, but there is a lack of real-world evidence and information related to its optimal sequencing and effectiveness across different lines of therapy.
This study aimed to analyze line-dependent outcomes and response patterns of lurbinectedin in SCLC patients.
