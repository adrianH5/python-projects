Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 2 (PTPN2) is a well-established protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that counterbalances protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) activity by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues.
Accumulating evidence demonstrates that dysregulated PTPN2 expression or activity regulates cancer biology, drives immune evasion, and confers resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, establishing it as a compelling therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.
Mechanistically, PTPN2 exerts immunosuppressive effects by dephosphorylating and negatively regulating immune response signaling, thereby dampening antitumor immunity and fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
Recent breakthroughs in PTPN2 inhibitor development, such as small molecules, natural compounds, and PROTAC degraders, have shown promising efficacy in restoring immune-mediated tumor control.
However, the anti-tumor therapy targeting PTPN2 still faces challenges, including its controversial role in some tumors, potential side effects, and the lack of highly effective and selective antagonists.
In this comprehensive review, we synthesize the crucial functions of PTPN2 in tumor progression and immune regulation, systematically present the latest research progress of PTPN2 inhibitors, critically analyze unresolved hurdles in drug development, and provide strategic perspectives on addressing these challenges, with the hope of accelerating the clinical translation of PTPN2-targeted therapy from bench to bedside.
