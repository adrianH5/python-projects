Survivors of head and neck cancer have complex nutritional and supportive care needs.
These needs result from the tumour's proximity to organs essential for normal eating function and the intensive treatment targeting those organs.
Despite the crucial role of nutrition and supportive care in head and neck cancer, research and funding are lacking compared with other cancer types.
This Review was compiled and written by a team of multidisciplinary medical professionals.
Topics include poor access to medical nutrition therapy (MNT), MNT reimbursement policies, long-term survivorship care needs, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, nutrition literacy, psychological services, speech-language pathology care, and concomitant physical activity.
The goal of this work is to define current issues in research and practice, advocate for the expansion of head and neck cancer funding opportunities, and raise awareness of head and neck cancer supportive care needs and challenges.
This work provides a roadmap for health-care professionals, researchers, policy makers, and funding agencies to prioritise nutrition in head and neck cancer care, with the overarching goal of improving treatment outcomes and quality of life.
