The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) Incidental Findings Working Group has updated its guidance on the management of incidentally detected gallbladder polyps, originally published in 2020.
Prompted by new evidence and recent international guidelines, the Working Group re-evaluated the literature and assessed both the 2022 Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) Consensus Recommendations and the 2022 joint European guidelines.
The updated guidance reflects a shift toward assessing polyp morphology and reduced surveillance and intervention for small polyps, endorsing the SRU's evidence-based, risk-stratified approach over the more conservative European recommendations.
This update aims to minimize unnecessary imaging and surgery for benign polyps while maintaining patient safety.
