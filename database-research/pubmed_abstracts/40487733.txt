Totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) are commonly used for prolonged intravenous treatment, particularly in oncology.
Although removal is typically a straightforward procedure at the end of treatment, it can occasionally be complicated by adhesion of the distal end of the catheter to the intravascular wall.
This rare complication is often associated with factors such as prolonged catheter dwell time, use of polyurethane material, and younger age at insertion.
The technique used for removal depends largely on the degree of adhesion.
We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with a TIVAD in place for 12 years for chemotherapy for breast cancer.
Removal was challenging due to distal adhesion of the catheter but was ultimately successful following careful dissection and traction.
