Pediatric oncology patients face heightened mortality rates, primarily due to bacteremia exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Given hyperinflammation's role in coronavirus pathogenesis and the importance of inflammatory biomarkers in adults, we aim to explore 60-day mortality predictors in children with cancer, where research remains limited.
This study aimed to investigate predictors of mortality in pediatric oncology patients with COVID-19, focusing on bacteremia and inflammatory biomarkers.
