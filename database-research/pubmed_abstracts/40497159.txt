The latent class profile model (LCPM) is a widely used technique for identifying distinct subgroups within a sample based on observations' longitudinal responses to categorical items.
This paper proposes an expanded version of LCPM by embedding time-specific structures.
Such development allows analysts to investigate associations between latent class memberships and time-dependent predictors at specific time points.
We suggest a simultaneous estimation of latent class measurement parameters via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which yields valid point and interval estimators of associations between latent class memberships and covariates.
We illustrate the validity of our estimation strategy via numerical studies.
In addition, we demonstrate the novelty of the proposed model by analyzing the head and neck cancer data set.
