Cancer immunotherapy has changed the therapeutic landscape for multiple types of cancer, yet a majority of patients do not respond or develop resistance.
Dysregulated activation of oncogenic signalling pathways can lead to tumour immune evasion and the creation of an immunosuppressive "cold" tumour microenvironment, contributing to resistance to immunotherapy.
Research indicates that targeting these oncogenic pathways can enhance antitumour immune responses and convert "cold" tumours into "hot" ones, thereby improving the efficacy of immunotherapy.
This review summarizes the recent advance of oncogenic signalling on tumour immune evasion and the formation of a "cold" tumour microenvironment.
It also summarizes the mechanisms by which targeting oncogenic signalling pathways to enhance antitumour immunity and its effects on cancer immunotherapy.
Additionally, therapeutic targets and agents for oncogenic signalling pathways, along with drug-target structural binding mechanisms, are summarized in this study.
Relevant clinical trials involving the combination of oncogenic pathway inhibitor and cancer immunotherapy are reviewed.
Finally, we discuss the current status and challenges of targeting oncogenic signalling pathways to enhance immunotherapy and outlined potential future research directions based on current findings.
