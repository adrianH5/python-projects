Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and most patients are diagnosed at a stage where the disease is unresectable, locally advanced, or has already metastasized.
Invasive pancreatic cancer is believed to arise through a progression of noninvasive ductal lesions referred to as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).
The mechanisms driving the transition from PanIN, to invasive PDAC are not fully understood.
Moreover, extensive stromal involvement of pancreatic cancer tissue complicates bulk analysis, hindering precise tumor-specific molecular data.
