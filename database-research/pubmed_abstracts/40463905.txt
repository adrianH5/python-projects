Concurrent genetic alterations (e.g., TP53 comutations) significantly impair EGFR-TKI responsiveness and survival outcomes in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), which is a key subunit of SWI/SNF complexes, demonstrates critical regulatory functions as a tumour suppressor gene in cancer.
The aim of this study is to determine the role of ARID1A deficiency in the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in LUAD.
