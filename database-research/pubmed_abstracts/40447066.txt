Instigating novel therapeutic strategies to combat breast cancer has become an urgent need.
Astaxanthin (ASX), a keto-carotenoid, has been confirmed to possess antitumor activity, yet studies on breast cancer are still limited.
The present study was deployed to unveil ASX's antitumor effects, alone or combined with doxorubicin (DOX), on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in Sprague‒Dawley female rats.
Five groups of rats were assigned (n = 10), including normal group, which received the vehicle only, whereas other groups received DMBA for tumor induction, after which: group 3 received ASX (25 mg/kg/day; orally), group 4 received DOX (2 mg/kg/week; i.p.
), and group 5 received both drugs.
This study focused on assessing the role of Notch-1 signaling with some miRNAs orchestrating the pathway.
Herein, ASX boosted miR-34a expression, which decreased the level of Notch-1 protein.
In addition, miR-34a upregulation halted cell cycle progression by augmenting p21 protein level and triggering apoptosis by decreasing survivin and increasing Bax protein levels.
Moreover, the downregulated miR-146a and miR-210 were escorted by decreased NF-κB and VEGF protein levels, respectively, suggesting their potential role in angiogenesis.
Remarkably, ASX/DOX combination showed greater effects than either agent alone.
Correlation and bioinformatics analyses manifested a significant relationship among all studied parameters.
The ASX's restorative effect was further confirmed by histopathological examination.
To the best of our knowledge, this study verified ASX's ability to abrogate DMBA-induced mammary tumors by impeding Notch-1 pathway, thus mitigating cell cycle progression and angiogenesis and augmenting apoptosis, exemplifying the interplay between Notch-1 and its downstream targets with different miRNAs.
