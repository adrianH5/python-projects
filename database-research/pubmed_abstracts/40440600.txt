The integration and utilization of digital media, gamified learning strategies, and artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamentally transforming the landscape of oncology education and learning.
These technologies collectively enhance knowledge dissemination, facilitate professional networking and mentoring, and enrich the overall educational experience for the learner.
Digital formats, including social media, offer flexible and asynchronous learning modalities that provide access to the latest studies and research, expert commentary, and opportunities for professional development and collaboration.
Gamification, through the application of game-based elements within educational frameworks, promotes critical thinking, supports the acquisition and reinforcement of key concepts, and fosters engagement.
AI, increasingly recognized for its disruptive potential, introduces a new dimension of information exchange and novel methodologies for learner assessment and customization of educational pathways.
These tools also can present potential challenges, such as the proliferation of misinformation, heightened academic and professional competition, and the imperative to critically appraise AI-generated outputs.
This article examines the transformative role of these emerging technologies in oncology education, while also addressing the associated risks and underscoring the need for learners to cultivate evaluative and critical thinking skills to navigate these tools responsibly.
