The number of immuno-oncology medication approvals in current years has increased, indicating the immense potential of cancer immunotherapy.
Nucleic acid therapy has advanced significantly in the interim.
The diverse capabilities of nucleic acid therapies, gene-editing guide RNA (gRNA), immunomodulatory DNA/RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA and siRNA, plasmids, and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), for modification of immune responses and change the target endogenous or synthetic gene's expression, make them appealing.
These skills can be extremely important in the creation of innovative immunotherapy approaches.
To be effective, these treatments must, however, overcome a number of delivery challenges, such as quick in vivo disintegration, inadequate absorption inside target cells, necessary nuclear entrance, along with possible in-vivo toxic potential in tissues and cells that are healthy.
Several of these obstacles have been addressed by the development of nanoparticle delivery methods, which allow nucleic acid therapies to be safely and successfully delivered to immune cells.
The nucleic acid applications for medicines employed for immunotherapy against cancer are covered in this chapter, along with the development of nanoparticle platforms that carry genome editing, mRNA, and DNA systems for improving the efficacy and safety profile in various therapies.
