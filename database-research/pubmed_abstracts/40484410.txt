Cervical cancer remains a significant public health challenge in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), with significant implications for women's health and sustainable development.
Despite being largely preventable, the EMR reported high prevalence of new cases and deaths in 2022.
The burden is expected to increase by 2050.
Primary healthcare (PHC) offers a cost-effective platform for delivering essential health services, such as human papilloma virus vaccination and early detection and referral programmes, which are crucial for reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality.
The paper discusses the role of PHC in cervical cancer interventions, showcasing successful examples from EMR countries and examining barriers like resource constraints, sociocultural factors and systemic inefficiencies.
It also proposes solutions, such as enhancing infrastructure and human resources, fostering public-private partnerships and adopting innovative screening methods.
By addressing these gaps and leveraging PHC's potential, EMR countries can improve cervical cancer outcomes and promote health equity for girls and women across the region.
