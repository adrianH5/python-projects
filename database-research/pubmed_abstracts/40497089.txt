Gastric cancer (GC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are common malignancies with high morbidity and mortality rates.
Traditional treatments often yield limited efficacy, especially in advanced cases.
Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), have shown promise.
However, the expression and interaction of pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1 (PES1) and PD-L1 in these cancers remain unclear.
Understanding their roles could provide new insights into tumor biology and improve therapeutic strategies.
