Penile cancer is a relatively rare cancer globally.
The cancer itself and its surgical excision can have detrimental physical and psychosocial implications on patients.
Patients can share assessments of their health and quality of life using patient-reported outcome measures.
These questionnaires are associated with more dynamic, patient-centred clinical decision-making, better patient symptom control and reduced need for hospitalisation.
There is a drive for increased implementation and digitalisation of patient-reported outcome measures, especially in surgical settings, to allow real-time monitoring and adjustment of patient management.
Consequently, this narrative review provides a contemporary exploration of the usage of patient-reported outcome measures in patients with penile cancer.
