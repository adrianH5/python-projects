Myositis-specific autoantibodies found in dermatomyositis (DM) are associated with clinical symptoms and responses to therapy and are useful for diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognostication.
Although the prevalence of anti-SAE antibodies in DM patients is low, clinical features such as skin symptoms preceding muscle symptoms and a higher incidence of dysphagia and malignancy have been reported.
We herein present a case of anti-SAE antibody-positive DM in which panniculitis of the lower legs, a rare dermatological manifestation of DM, preceded muscle symptoms by 2Â months.
This case was associated with cervical cancer; however, the clinical course of DM was favourable with glucocorticoid monotherapy.
Anti-SAE antibody-positive DM needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis of unexplained panniculitis without muscle symptoms.
