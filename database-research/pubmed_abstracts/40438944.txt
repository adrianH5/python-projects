Treatment burden is the workload of health care for people with long-term conditions and the impact on wellbeing.
A validated measure of treatment burden for use as an outcome measure in stroke trials is needed.
We adapted a patient-reported measure of treatment burden in multimorbidity, Patient Experience With Treatment and Self-Management (PETS), version 2.0, to create a stroke-specific measure, PETS-stroke, and examined its psychometric properties.
