Heme-Regulated Inhibitor (HRI) is one of the four mammalian kinases that phosphorylate eIF2Î±, facilitating a cellular response to stress through the regulation of mRNA translation.
Originally identified as a heme sensor in erythroid progenitor cells, HRI has since emerged as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and neurodegeneration.
Here, we characterize two modes of HRI inhibition using structural mass spectrometry, biochemistry, and biophysics.
We examined several competitive ATP-mimetic inhibitors-Dabrafenib, Encorafenib, and GCN2iB-and compared them to the heme-mimetic allosteric inhibitor, hemin.
By combining Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) with protein models generated by AlphaFold 3, we investigated the structural basis of inhibition by Dabrafenib and hemin.
Our analysis revealed that hemin inhibition induces large-scale structural rearrangements in HRI, which are not observed with ATP-mimetic inhibitors.
Our results suggest that HRI may be inhibited using two distinctly different modalities which may guide future drug development.
