The recurrent artery of Heubner (RAH) was first described by Johann Heubner in 1872 and later named by H.F. Aitken in 1909.
It is the largest medial lenticulostriate artery from the anterior cerebral artery (ACA).
Originating from the A1, A2, or ACA-anterior communicating artery junction, it supplies key brain structures like the caudate nucleus and anterior hypothalamus, with variations in origin and course among individuals.
