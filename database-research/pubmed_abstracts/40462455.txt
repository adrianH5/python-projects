Health-promoting lifestyle (HPL) is strongly associated with health outcomes.
In clinical practice, health-promotion behaviours in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) are not good, which seriously affects patients' prognosis.
This study aims to investigate the current status and influencing factors of HPL in HNC patients.
