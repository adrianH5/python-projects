The outcomes of patients who undergo surgical staging for endometrial cancer using the KangDuo Surgical Robot-01 (KD-SR-01) have not been compared with those of patients who undergo this procedure using the da Vinci Xi system.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the KD-SR-01 system for surgical staging of endometrial cancer by comparing short-term outcomes to those of counterparts who underwent surgery using the da Vinci Xi system.
