Splenomegaly is a hallmark feature of myelofibrosis, driven by extramedullary hematopoiesis due to progressive bone marrow fibrosis.
Enlarged spleens cause significant symptoms, impair quality of life, and complicate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) by increasing the risk of delayed engraftment, graft failure, and relapse.
While Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors can reduce spleen size, some patients remain refractory or lose response over time.
Splenic irradiation has emerged as an alternative strategy, though optimal protocols and safety profiles remain unclear.
