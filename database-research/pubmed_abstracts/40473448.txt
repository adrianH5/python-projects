Relacorilant, a first-in-class selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, increases a tumour's sensitivity to chemotherapy by reducing cortisol signalling.
This study aimed to show whether the addition of relacorilant to nab-paclitaxel improves progression-free and overall survival in females with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
