Circadian rhythm (CR) disruption has been confirmed as a contributing factor to tumor progression.
However, regulating circadian genes shows an inhibitory effect on ovarian tumor initiation and progression, which highlights the urgent necessity to regulate tumors' CR to understand their role in ovarian cancer (OC) therapy precisely.
Herein, a novel near-infrared (NIR) light-controlled spatiotemporal strategy is presented, aiming to manipulate ovarian tumors' CR while enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy agents.
To achieve this strategy, a versatile nanoplatform (NP
