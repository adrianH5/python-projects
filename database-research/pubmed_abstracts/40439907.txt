This qualitative study aimed to analyze the experiences and needs of colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy during the diagnosis and treatment process.
Purposeful sampling was used in the study, and 15 colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were included.
Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured interview form and analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-stage method.
In the study, 5 themes and 10 subthemes emerged that reflect the experiences and needs of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
The main themes were: facing off cancer, navigating symptom challenges, navigating challenges beyond health, uncertain future full of fears, and finding strength in adversity.
The study provided a comprehensive overview of the emotional, physical, psychological, social, and financial challenges encountered during the treatment process, as well as the coping methods, support systems, and needs of patients.
The findings reveal that colorectal cancer patients have numerous ongoing needs including physical, emotional, psychological, spiritual, and financial support.
The results emphasize that healthcare professionals need to take more initiative to improve colorectal cancer patients' quality of life and care processes.
