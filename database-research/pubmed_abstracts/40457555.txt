Curative therapy for most children with leukemia and lymphoma includes multiple lumbar punctures (LPs) for the administration of intrathecal chemotherapy, commonly facilitated with deep sedation or general anesthesia (GA).
There is ongoing concern about the potential for neurocognitive deficits induced by GA in the developing brain.
The objective of this quality improvement (QI) project was to implement and evaluate a process whereby children received the level of sedation they need for their LPs and not GA by default.
