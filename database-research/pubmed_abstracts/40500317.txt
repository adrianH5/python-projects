The association between statins and breast cancer-specific mortality and recurrence has been examined in several previous observational studies and meta-analyses.

In this study, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to ascertain the association between statins and both breast cancer death (BCD) and breast cancer recurrence (BCR).
