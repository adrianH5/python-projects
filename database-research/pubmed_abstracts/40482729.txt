The MIRAGE trial (NCT04384770) showed that aggressive planning target volume (PTV) margin reduction, achieved by leveraging the advanced image-guidance of MRI-guided (MRg) radiotherapy, led to lower toxicity after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the prostate compared with CT-guided SBRT (CTgSBRT) with a standard PTV margin.
It is unknown whether the dosimetric benefit of reducing PTV margins alone - independent of the other components of advanced image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) that allowed margin reduction - would be predicted to replicate this decrease in toxicity.
