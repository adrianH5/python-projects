Gastric stem cells (GSCs) and chief cells are vital for maintaining gastric epithelial homeostasis.
However, under pathological conditions, these cells undergo significant functional changes, contributing to the progression of precancerous lesions of gastric cancer (PLGC).
Dysregulation of key signaling pathways such as WNT, NF-ÎºB, and YAP leads to aberrant cellular behaviors, which are implicated in the early stages of gastric carcinogenesis.
This study aimed to elucidate the roles of GSCs and chief cells in maintaining gastric epithelial integrity, their contributions to the development of precancerous lesions, and the molecular mechanisms that regulate their behavior during disease progression.
