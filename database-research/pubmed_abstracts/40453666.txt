Cinnamaldehyde (CA), a naturally occurring aromatic aldehyde from cinnamon bark, has been investigated for its biological activity in laboratory settings.
However, its α,β-unsaturated aldehyde structure designates it as a pan-assay interference compound (PAINS), which can produce non-specific effects through chemical reactivity-particularly in vitro-raising concerns about the validity and interpretation of its reported anti-tumor activity.
