Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a chronic kidney condition that arises from prolonged hyperglycaemia that can progress to kidney failure, severe morbidity, and mortality if left untreated.
It is the major cause of chronic kidney disease among people who have diabetes, accounting for a significant percentage of patients with end-stage kidney disease who require kidney replacement therapy.
