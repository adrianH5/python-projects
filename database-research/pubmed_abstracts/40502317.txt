Dental clinicians and researchers have recently recommended oral microbial examinations to more accurately diagnose and treat oral diseases, including periodontitis and dental caries.
Theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that oral microbiota may also be associated with non-oral diseases, such as gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal diseases.
This review highlights studies demonstrating microbial alterations in the oral cavity associated with malignant tumors including gastric, colorectal, esophageal, and lung cancers, implying that these alterations may serve as early indicators for non-invasive diagnosis and risk assessment of cancer development.
Furthermore, we addressed the implications of oral microbial co-occurrence with malignant tumors, such as
