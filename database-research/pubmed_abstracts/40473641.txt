Lineage tracing remains an essential approach towards understanding cell fate, tissue formation, and human development.
Herein, we review advancements in lineage tracing techniques, the integration of sequencing and imaging technologies, and computational tools for analysis.
We report on recent lineage tracing applications, including integrative techniques (MADM-CloneSeq), in situ hybridization (DART-FISH), and modern workflows (BaSISS), which hold an essential role in our aim to unravel lineage hierarchies and, ultimately, human development.
