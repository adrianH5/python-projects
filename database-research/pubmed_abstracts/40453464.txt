After robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) for localized prostate cancer, post-operative stress urinary incontinence (SUI) impacts patient quality-of-life (QOL).
A simple and less invasive treatment for SUI in these patients is urgently needed.
Deflux is a viscous gel that consists of a mixture of sodium hyaluronate and dextranomer beads.
It is administered by transurethral approach for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux.
In this study, we aim to establish a minimally invasive treatment for post-prostatectomy SUI through transurethral Deflux injection.
