Cancer cells drive the increase in vascular permeability mediating tumor cell extravasation and metastatic seeding.
VIAN-c4551, an antiangiogenic peptide analog of vasoinhibin, inhibits the growth and vascularization of melanoma tumors in mice.
Because VIAN-c4551 is a potent inhibitor of vascular permeability, we evaluated whether its antitumor action extended to a reduction in metastasis generation.
