Previous studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic disparities in the treatment and outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer.
However, none of these studies has examined whether these disparities exist in a closed health care delivery system.
The aim of this study was to identify racial and ethnic disparities in rates of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastasis (CRLM) within the Kaiser Permanente Southern California system.
