β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) agonists, widely used in clinical urology, have recently been implicated in modulating cancer progression.
While prior studies have reported both pro- and anti-tumor effects via fat browning and immune modulation, the mechanisms and organ-specific outcomes remain unclear.
We aimed to confirm the effects of β3-AR agonists on primary tumors and lung metastasis using metastatic orthotopic murine renal cell carcinoma (RCC) models.
