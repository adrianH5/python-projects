Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women, with its prevalence exhibiting a troubling increase.
Increased emphasis must be made on developing effective therapies owing to the high prevalence and increasing incidence of breast cancer.
Presently, traditional passive therapies have several unresolved limitations.
Conversely, novel immunotherapy strategies, such as cancer vaccines, have shown encouraging potential in addressing late stages of breast cancer.
The primary aim of this work was to use MAGE-A, MAM-A, and Gal-3 antigenic proteins in the formulation of a multiepitope vaccine for breast cancer.
To elicit strong immune responses, we first discovered antigenic epitopes of proteins and evaluated their immunogenicity.
To diminish junctional immunogenicity, promiscuous epitopes were conjugated with the appropriate adjuvant (IL-12 protein) and linked with a suitable linker (GSST).
The optimal estimated a three-dimensional model was enhanced and verified to get a superior 3D model.
Molecular docking studies and dynamic modeling were used to establish the structural stability and integrity of the vaccine/mouse TLR-2, 4,Â 7, and 9 complexes.
The vaccine was finally optimized and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector.
Moreover, the immunological simulation of the vaccine demonstrated its capacity to elicit immune responses (B cells, T cells, antibodies, and cytokines) against breast cancer.
Consequently, the examination of the developed vaccine by immunoinformatic demonstrates its potential to provoke strong humoral and cellular immune responses in the intended organism.
Consequently, it has potential as a therapeutic agent against breast cancer and may facilitate more study in the domain.
