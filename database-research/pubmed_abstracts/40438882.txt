Patient navigation (PN) is a healthcare service delivery model designed to partner clients with service providers to reduce challenges to health care, as well as to improve access to care by identifying opportunities to coordinate services for clients.
The IMPACT WV project at the West Virginia University Center for Excellence in Disabilities (WVU CED) implemented PN models of care for caregivers of infants exposed to substances in utero.
The purpose of this program was to reduce burden for potentially at-risk families and improve caregiver and infant outcomes as a result.
To understand the processes that influence the implementation of PN models of care with this population, the project modified existing surveys developed by the Fox Chase Virtual Health Cancer Program.
