Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, low-grade neoplasm.
Abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a critical role in LAM pathogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, which may increase susceptibility to malignancies in these patients.
However, owing to the rarity of LAM, comprehensive data on the risk of malignancy in this population are limited.
