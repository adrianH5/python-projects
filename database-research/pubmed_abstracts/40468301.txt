Primary immature teratoma of the parietal lobe is an exceptionally rare intracranial germ cell tumor, accounting for <â€‰1% of all primary intracranial malignancies.
Due to its rarity and overlapping radiological features with other tumors, such as glioma, immature teratomas are often misdiagnosed.
Here, we report the case of a 48-year-old woman with a parietal lobe immature teratoma, initially misdiagnosed as a "glioma," highlighting the diagnostic challenges and management strategies.
