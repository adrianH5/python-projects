Macrocystic lymphatic malformation, previously known as cystic hygroma, is a congenital anomaly and a subtype of lymphatic malformations.
The most common location for macrocystic lymphangiomas is the neck, followed by the axilla.
On rare occasions, it can be found in other organs and tissues.
Our case presented with a large diaphragmatic macrocystic lymphangioma.
Our case is about an incidentally discovered right subdiaphragmatic abdominal mass in a normally healthy middle childhood patient.
The patient was treated surgically by resection of the mass.
Even though the diaphragm is a rare location for cystic hygroma, it should form part of the differential diagnosis for subdiaphragmatic lesions.
