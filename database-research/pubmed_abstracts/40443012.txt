Precision medicine in oncology using actionable molecular biomarkers to guide treatment selection has been associated with favorable outcomes; however, many potentially eligible patients do not receive it.
This Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Market Insights program sought to characterize unmet needs in biomarker testing among managed care stakeholders, to develop best practice and consensus recommendations to support addressing these needs, and to gain insights on potential quality measures related to biomarker testing.
The program used a modified Delphi process and included in-depth interviews with expert panelists, a national survey of managed care professionals, and a consensus survey of experts.
Areas of unmet need in biomarker testing identified were education, guidelines and protocols, timeliness, process, and equity.
Twenty-two best practices were suggested by managed care experts and other stakeholders; 9 of these best practices achieved consensus.
These consensus recommendations addressed biomarker test ordering and test performance, treatment decisions based on biomarker testing, cost-effectiveness of biomarker testing, and health disparities in access to biomarker testing.
Opportunities for education and improvements in infrastructure to implement these recommendations were identified.
Further investigation is needed to develop quality measures; although, valuable insights were gained.
