Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) belong to the family of class A G-protein-coupled receptors that are important for immune modulation and inflammation and are emerging as potential therapeutic targets for several inflammatory diseases.
FPRs have shown therapeutic roles in the management of cardiovascular diseases, neuroinflammation, and cancer.
Biased agonists are an active topic in the further revisions that encompass the utilization of a definite subset of signaling pathways to improve therapeutic maladies, in parallel with reducing the negative effects.
