Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare and aggressive cancer of the biliary tract with a very low survival rate.
The availability of diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for its management is limited.
The study identifies potential genetic biomarkers of GBC by analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through microarray profiling and constructing regulatory networks using systems biology techniques.
