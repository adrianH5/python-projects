Molecularly targeted agents have revolutionized the paradigm of cancer treatment; however, their efficacy is often downplayed by rapid clearance in vivo, inferior cellular delivery and drug resistance.
The combination of targeted drugs could improve the clinical efficacy only to some extent, due to overlapping toxicities and difficulty in maintaining certain drug ratios.
Here, we report on ratiometric codelivery of FLT3 and CDK4/6 dual inhibitors, gilteritinib and palbociclib, by daratumumab-decorated polymersomes (GIPA@DP) for high-efficacy targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
GIPA@DP showed synergistic anti-AML effects on MV-4-11 cells, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of ca.
2.6 ng/mL for each drug, which was further reduced to below 1 ng/mL by pretreating the cells with all-trans retinoic acid.
GIPA@DP maintained an essentially constant GI/PA ratio in vivo and actively targeted AML cells at different leukemia sites.
Selective AML-targeting in conjunction with ratiometric drug codelivery and synergistic anti-AML effects of GIPA@DP collectively led to significant survival benefits in CD38-upregulated MV-4-11 and Molm-13-Luc AML models, outperforming the nontargeted control (GIPA@P) and a mixture of two targeted single drug formulations (GI@DP + PA@DP).
This targeted ratiometric delivery of dual inhibitors provides a new treatment strategy for AML and other malignancies.
