Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally, characterized by high heterogeneity and drug resistance, which significantly impacts clinical outcomes.
The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in HCC initiation and progression, with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression closely linked to tumor prognosis.
N-glycosylation of proteins modulates immune responses within the TME.
ALG3, a key N-glycosylation enzyme, is involved in protein glycosylation.
Although ALG3 expression has been studied in various tumors, its role in regulating the immune microenvironment and its prognostic significance in HCC remain unclear.
