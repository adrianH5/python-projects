Lymph node metastasis (LNM) significantly affects prognosis and treatment strategies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Current diagnostic methods, including imaging and histopathology, have limited sensitivity and specificity.
This study aims to develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models that predict LNM in NSCLC using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
