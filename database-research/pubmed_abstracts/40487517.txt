Frailty is prevalent among preoperative gastric cancer (GC) patients and significantly affects surgical risk and long-term recovery.
Family health may hold substantial potential for mitigating frailty, although the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear.
This study aims to investigate the impact of family health on frailty in preoperative GC patients, and the mediating effects of health literacy and physical activity.
