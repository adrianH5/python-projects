The effects of cell senescence in individual cell populations of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on cancer progression remain unclear.
Here, we investigated the effects of cell senescence caused by inactivation of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (Tert) in distinct TME components.
We generated genetic
