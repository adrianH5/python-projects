Evidence that antihypertensive medication (AHTN) use is associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer (KC) is emerging.
However, limited evidence is available on disentangling the effects of AHTN use on KC from hypertension, which is a risk factor for KC.
We aimed to identify pooled estimates for the associations between AHTN use and KC risk, independent of hypertension.
