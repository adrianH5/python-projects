Targeting CD3 × CD20 bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) represents a new milestone in the salvage therapy of relapsed/relapsed large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.
However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains one of the major concerns in clinical practice of CD3 × CD20 BsAbs.
This study aimed to identify the potential predictive factors and to construct a nomogram of grade ≥ 2 CRS in CD3 × CD20 BsAbs in Chinese patients.
