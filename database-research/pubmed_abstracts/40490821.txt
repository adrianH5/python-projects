Prostate cancer (PCa) is a serious malignancy worldwide with the fifth highest mortality rate among tumors in males, and there are unmet clinical needs for PCa treatment.
In this work, we aim to explore the expression and overlap between B7 Homolog 3 protein (B7-H3) and cell-surface receptor c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), to provide insight on B7-H3 and c-MET bi-specific ADC drugs development for advanced PCa.
