​​Exosomes, as natural intercellular messengers, are gaining prominence as delivery vehicles in nanomedicine, offering a superior alternative to conventional synthetic nanoparticles for cancer therapeutics.
Unlike lipid, polymer, or metallic nanoparticles, which often face challenges related to immunogenicity, targeting precision, and off-tumor toxicity, exosomes can effectively encapsulate a diverse range of therapeutic agents while exhibiting low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and organotropic properties.
This review examines recent advancements in exosome bioengineering over the past decade.
Innovations such as microfluidics-based platforms, nanoporation, fusogenic hybrids, and genetic engineering have significantly improved loading efficiencies, production scalability, and pharmacokinetics of exosomes.
These advancements facilitate tumor-specific cargo delivery, resulting in substantial improvements in retention and efficacy essential for clinical success.
Moreover, enhanced biodistribution, targeting, and bioavailability-through strategies such as cell selection, surface modifications, membrane composition alterations, and biomaterial integration-suggests a promising future for exosomes as an ideal nanomedicine delivery platform.
We also highlight the translational impact of these strategies through emerging clinical trials.
Additionally, we outline a framework for clinical translation that focuses on: cargo selection, organotropic cell sourcing, precision loading methodologies, and route-specific delivery optimization.
In summary, this review emphasizes the potential of exosomes to overcome the pharmacokinetic and safety challenges that have long impeded oncology drug development, thus enabling safer and more effective cancer treatments.
