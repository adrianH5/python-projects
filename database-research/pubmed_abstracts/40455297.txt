Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show promising efficacy in colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma therapy, especially in combination.
However, given the many cutaneous adverse effects (CAE) associated with each, there is concern for overlap and exacerbation of toxicities.
EGFRIs are associated with acneiform rashes and paronychia, while ICIs are associated with lichenoid dermatitis and psoriasis.
Xerosis, pruritus, and eczema are seen with both drugs.
Understanding the CAEs of EGFRI-ICI combination therapy may guide the management of toxicities and improve adherence to life-saving therapy.
