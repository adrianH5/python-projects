Despite the increasing use of reirradiation, our understanding of appropriate normal tissue dose constraints remains limited.
This is intrinsically tied to major uncertainties concerning evaluation of cumulative doses from multiple treatment courses.
This study aimed to: i) retrospectively evaluate cumulative normal tissue doses in patients treated with pelvic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) reirradiation, taking account of anatomical change and fraction size effects, and ii) produce preliminary data regarding safe cumulative normal tissue doses.
