It was found that 33.8-52.5% of patients experienced nausea and vomiting after Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) for liver cancer, based on prior literature.

In this study, we investigated the factors associated with nausea and vomiting after TACE and developed a predictive model to predict these adverse events.
