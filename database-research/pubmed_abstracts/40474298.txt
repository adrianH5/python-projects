Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and aggressive malignancy that frequently metastasizes to the liver, presenting significant therapeutic challenges.
Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying CRC liver metastasis and resistance to immune therapy remain poorly understood.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving CRC metastasis using a novel approach, which includes the establishment of highly metastatic CRC cell lines.
