Skin cancer mortality disproportionately affects low- and lower-middle-income regions despite the prevalence being lower than in high-income countries.
Considering the need to diagnose it early for the best outcomes, this review addresses the barriers preventing it from being diagnosed and treated promptly and proposes possible solutions.
Some of the barriers we found include the low number of dermatologists and pathologists, inadequate facilities, lack of education, the cost of healthcare, the denial of needing professional help, the fear and stigmatization of a skin cancer diagnosis, and the reliance on non-medical therapies.
Meanwhile, solutions we identified are training programs for healthcare professionals and the public, technological advancements (including nanotechnology-based treatments, telemedicine, and social media use, the development and implementation of artificial intelligence programs), international collaborations, research, and increasing the number of cancer registries and national cancer control plans.
Despite these solutions not being foolproof, they will lead to earlier cancer diagnosis, more individuals seeking skin check-ups, better knowledge of skin cancer, improving the quality of life of vulnerable populations, and decrease in mortality.
