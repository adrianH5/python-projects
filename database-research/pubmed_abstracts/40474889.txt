Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is the second most prevalent primary liver cancer, characterized by insidious onset and high malignancy.
Many patients are diagnosed at an inoperable stage, and the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains limited.
This study aimed to provide a comprehensive review of the histological classification, genetic alterations, molecular subtypes, and corresponding imaging signatures of iCCA, highlighting its heterogeneity and offering insights into targeted therapy and personalized treatment.
The heterogeneity of iCCA poses significant challenges to both targeted therapy and immunotherapy, necessitating in-depth exploration at the molecular and subtyping levels.
Investigating genetic variations, signaling pathway alterations, and molecular subtypes can aid in patient stratification.
Stratifying iCCA patients allows for more precise treatment selection, ultimately improving survival outcomes.
Imaging, as a non-invasive tool, holds substantial potential for predicting subtypes and molecular profiles.
It is possible to infer histological and molecular features from imaging, or to interpret imaging signatures in light of known histological and molecular data.
This integrative approach, combining external imaging with internal molecular insights, fosters a comprehensive understanding of iCCA's characteristics and enhances clinical management.
