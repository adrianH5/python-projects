Although rosuvastatin is widely prescribed in China, its pharmacokinetic profile shows substantial interindividual variability, primarily due to polymorphisms in drug transporters (SLCO1B1 and ABCG2) and variations in hepatic function.
Existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, primarily developed for Caucasian populations, may lack predictive accuracy in Chinese patients, highlighting the need for population-specific models to support precision dosing.
