Molecular profiling is quickly becoming standard for patients with advanced cancer, with an increasing number of biomarker-directed therapies and innovative precision diagnostics available.
However, with the expansion of relevant biomarkers, clinicians often face challenges obtaining optimal detection from limited tumor tissue.
Here, we present biomarker detection rates from comprehensive genomic and immune profiling (CGIP) performed as a component of routine clinical care using a multi-modal testing strategy.
