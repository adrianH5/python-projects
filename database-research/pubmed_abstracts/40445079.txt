Uterine fibroids are the leading cause of hysterectomies among women of childbearing age.
This study aimed to elicit the knowledge and perceptions of childbearing women towards uterine fibroids.
A quantitative, cross-sectional descriptive design was used and data were collected from a sample of 362 women of reproductive age residing in a selected township in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Durban University of Technology's Institutional Research Ethics Committee (IREC - Ref No.
BIREC 014/21).
A pre-tested survey was conducted to collect data for this study.
SPSS version 27 was used to analyze data and further employed descriptive statistics.
Inferential statistics were also conducted to investigate relationships between important variables and respondents who self-reported being diagnosed with uterine fibroids.
Most participants, 73.8% (n=267), had no awareness of uterine fibroids.
Participants also demonstrated poor knowledge regarding the aetiology and symptoms of the condition.
However, nearly half of the participants, 49.2% (n=178), perceived uterine fibroids to be of spiritual origin, citing evil spirits and witchcraft as the cause.
The study findings suggest that women in the selected township lack accurate knowledge about uterine fibroids.
Despite the limitations related to the use of a convenience sampling approach for data collection and the subsequently low levels of education observed among certain participants, the study findings provide useful baseline information to inform the development of tailored educational interventions for the condition.
