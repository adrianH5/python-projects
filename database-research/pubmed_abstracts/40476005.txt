Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), yet dental students' knowledge of this association varies widely.
Given the critical role dentists play in early detection and prevention, understanding their level of knowledge is essential.
This study systematically reviews existing research to assess dental students' awareness of HPV and its link to OPC.
