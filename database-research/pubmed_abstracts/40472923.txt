Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective locoregional treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Arterial administration can enhance local drug concentrations while reducing systemic toxicity.
The potential synergistic effects of combining locoregional treatments with systemic therapy in advanced HCC warrant further investigation.
This phase 2 study (NCT04796025) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with intra-arterial infusion of sintilimab and bevacizumab in patients with advanced HCC.
Eligible patients received TACE on demand plus intra-arterial infusion of sintilimab and bevacizumab for four cycles.
Maintenance therapy included intravenous administration of sintilimab and bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.
The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR) based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST).
A total of 34 patients (median age, 53 years [IQR 45-59]; 33 men) were enrolled.
With a median follow-up of 10.3 months (IQR 5.8-15.6), our results showed a favorable ORR of 70.6 %.
The median PFS was calculated as 6.0 months (95 % CI 4.8 - not reached), and the median OS was 12.2 months (95 % CI 9.3 - not reached).
Common treatment-related adverse events (any grade) included elevated alanine transaminase (17.6 %), abdominal pain (14.7 %), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (11.8 %), and hypertension (11.8 %).
Grade 3 adverse events included hypertension (2.9 %) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (8.8 %).
No serious treatment-related adverse events were observed.
TACE combined with sintilimab and bevacizumab has demonstrated a favorable ORR and promising efficacy in advanced HCC, with manageable side effects.
