Plasma-based testing with circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is an active area of biomarker exploratory studies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations.
The Exosome-focused Translational Research for Afatinib study prospectively explored novel plasma biomarkers for afatinib monotherapy in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations using genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics.
Herein, we present the results of the genomics part.
