Ovarian fibromas, especially those of the mitotically active cellular subtype, are very rare in children; however, children with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) are prone to these neoplasms.
We present a 12-year-old girl with an ovarian mitotically active cellular fibroma (MACF) with no personal or family history of NBCCS who underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy.
We searched the English literature on pediatric ovarian MACF.
To date, only 3 cases of MACF in children have been reported.
We present a pediatric case that represents the youngest reported case of MACF thus far.
Special attention is required to differentiate this tumor from its malignant mimics to avoid overtreatment, such as radical surgeries.
Long-term follow-up and thorough investigation of the manifestations of hereditary cancer syndromes should be considered.
