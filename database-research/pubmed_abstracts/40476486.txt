Chimeric kinase J-PKAcα represents a potential therapeutic target for fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC).
Structure-based design and screening were applied to improve the potency of the marine-derived kinase inhibitor aplithianine A targeting J-PKAcα.
Three classes of aplithianines (I, II, and III) including >150 analogs were synthesized, significantly improving biochemical IC
