Mutations of RAS genes are detected in a spectrum of follicular-patterned thyroid tumors.
Preoperative prediction of invasive cancers based on the presence of RAS mutation alone is challenging because non-invasive and invasive tumors tend to have similar sonographic and cytologic features.
The aim of this study was to perform clinicopathologic and molecular analyses of RAS-mutant tumors, identify molecular and clinical markers associated with invasiveness, and determine their diagnostic and therapeutic potentials.
