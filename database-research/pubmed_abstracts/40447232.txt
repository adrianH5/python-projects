Early and accurate diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is crucial for the success of joint-preserving treatments.
Although multimodal diagnostic criteria, including radiographs, enhance diagnostic accuracy, they are limited in detecting pre-radiographic stages.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized; however, it is associated with the risk of overdiagnosis.
This study aimed to characterize the pre-radiographic stage of ONFH diagnosed solely by MRI and to elucidate its progression and factors influencing it.
