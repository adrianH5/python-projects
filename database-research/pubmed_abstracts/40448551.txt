To summarize the research status of lung cancer immunotherapy using bibliometrics.
CiteSpace software was used to analyze all literature on lung cancer immunotherapy collected from the Web of Science (WOS) database from 2004 to 2024.
A total of 1702 publications on lung cancer immunotherapy were searched, and the number of articles increased more rapidly after 2014.
Two areas intensively studied by the discipline are tumor microenvironment and dendritic cells.
He, Jie, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College, and China of America were the authors, institutions, and countries with the most.
The research trajectory in the use of immunotherapy for lung cancer is thoroughly examined in this article.
With tumor microenvironment, blockade, nivolumab, resistance, and chemotherapy being the primary research hotspots.
Future studies might concentrate on melanoma, antibody, dendritic cells, non-small cell lung cancer, and ctla 4 blockade.
