The detection of incidental masses in cancer patients, such as vulvar leiomyomas, is rare and can complicate the diagnostic process.
We report a case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with a large, neglected breast tumor, which raised clinical suspicion of metastatic breast cancer.
A computed tomography scan showed an osteosclerotic pelvic lesion, raising concern for bone metastasis.
A whole-body positron emission tomography scan revealed no bone metastasis but detected a hypermetabolic left vulvar mass, presumed to be a Bartholin cyst.
Surgical excision confirmed it to be a vulvar leiomyoma.
The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, followed by a left radical mastectomy with significant residual tumor burden.
Currently, the patient is receiving radiotherapy along with adjuvant hormonal treatment, and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy is scheduled after the radiotherapy.
When found incidentally during cancer staging, vulvar leiomyomas can cause diagnostic confusion.
This case highlights the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary differential diagnostic approach in the oncological assessment of cancer patients to avoid misdiagnosis and guide appropriate treatment strategies.
