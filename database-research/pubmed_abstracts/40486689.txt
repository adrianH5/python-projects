Inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFPs), also known as Vanek's tumors, are rare, benign mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly found in the gastric antrum.
However, small bowel involvement is exceedingly uncommon, and when present, it can lead to intussusception, a rare yet serious complication.
Here, we report a case of a 65-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia who presented with persistent abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Imaging revealed an ileo-ileal intussusception, necessitating surgical resection.
Histopathology confirmed an IFP as the lead point.
This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of IFPs in the small intestine and underscores the importance of considering rare causes of intussusception in adults.
