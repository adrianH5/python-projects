Background The interpretation of the multiparametric MRI, which combines dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), has the potential to increase MRI diagnostic accuracy.
Purpose To investigate and validate the potential of DWI with an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) cutoff in evaluating additional lesions detected at preoperative MRI in patients with breast cancer.
Materials and Methods In this retrospective review, data from patients with additional lesions (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] category 3 or higher) who underwent MRI between June 2019 and June 2021 were evaluated.
Two breast radiologists independently evaluated additional enhanced lesions and measured the ADC values.
The optimal ADC cutoff for downgrading lesions was determined according to the Youden index and was applied to a separate validation cohort.
The efficacy of prespecified ADC values (1.53 Ã— 10
