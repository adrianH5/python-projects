Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) is a rare subtype of appendiceal pathology characterized by epithelial hyperplasia, cellular atypia, and mucinous accumulation within the appendiceal lumen, leading to obstructive expansion of the organ.
Representing a mere 0.2% to 0.3% of all appendectomies and approximately 0.5% of gastrointestinal tumors, LAMN poses diagnostic challenges in surgical practice.
