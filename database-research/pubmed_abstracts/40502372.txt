Combination therapies of chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapy have shown promising results in the treatment of cold tumors.
Various chemotherapies trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and release of hallmarks immunogenic damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that have been related with immunostimulatory activities, leading to better patient prognosis.
We aim to optimize in vitro assays to detect DAMPs release in response to chemotherapeutic agents using a colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids model.
