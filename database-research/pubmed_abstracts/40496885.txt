Anlotinib is a novel highly potent multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
However, the safety, recommended dosage, pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics, and efficacy of anlotinib in paediatric patients have not been fully studied.
We aimed to evaluate the safety, PK, and feasibility of anlotinib in children with high risk, recurrent or refractory sarcomas.
