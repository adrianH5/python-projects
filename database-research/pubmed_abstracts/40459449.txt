Nerve injury is the most common complication following foot and ankle surgery, with painful neuroma reported in up to 10% of procedures.
Current treatment often yields varying degrees of pain relief.
Electrical stimulation (ES) through peripheral neuromodulation is an emerging technology associated with improvement in nerverelated pain and acceleration of neural regeneration.
This study assessed the short-term outcomes of combining nerve reconstruction techniques with ES in providing early pain relief for patients with symptomatic lower extremity neuromas.
