Colonoscopy is the most utilized screening test for colorectal cancer (CRC).
The adenoma detection rate (ADR), cecal intubation rate (CIR), and withdrawal time (WT) are established quality indicators (QIs) for colonoscopy.
The aim was to measure the effect of individual and group QIs in colonoscopy by providing quarterly meetings and email feedback on ADR, CIR, and WT.
