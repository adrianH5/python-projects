Bone involvement in multiple myeloma (MM) is marked by osteolysis, driven by excessive bone resorption and a profound suppression of bone formation.
Interactions between MM cells and the bone microenvironment-mediated by integrins,chemokines, and bone marrow stromal cells-play a critical role in the development of myeloma bone disease (MBD).
Key players include osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes.
Osteoclast activation is mainly driven by RANK/RANKL and other pro-osteoclastogenic factors that disrupt bone remodeling, while impaired bone formation involves Wnt signaling inhibition and Runx2/Cbfa1 suppression.
Emerging therapeutic strategies are focused on addressing both the tumor burden and the bone remodeling imbalance, with advances in molecular targeting and microRNA-based approaches.
Similarly, novel anti-myeloma therapies show promise for MBD, though their full impact is not yet defined.
This review highlights recent findings in MM-associated bone disease and discusses current and prospective therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes.
