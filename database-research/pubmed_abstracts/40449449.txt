The progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) disrupts the intestinal mucosal barrier, and impacting patient prognosis.
Traditional chemotherapy often induces gastrointestinal toxicity by damaging this barrier.
ZJP offers protection to the barrier and suppresses tumor growth.
Nonetheless, its impact on tumors and the intestinal microbiota remains inadequately elucidated.
This study delved into the interventional effects and the intervention mechanism of ZJP across different stages of CRC, unraveling its mechanisms in sustaining intestinal mucosal integrity amidst cancer progression and its impact on the gut microbiota.
