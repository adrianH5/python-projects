Long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) has been identified as a tumor suppressor due to its downregulation in several cancers.
However, our comprehensive analyses revealed aberrant overexpression of GAS5 in various cancers, with a direct association with SMARCA4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Differential expression analyses were conducted using publicly available transcriptome datasets.
Functional studies of GAS5 and its downstream targets in HCC were performed via small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown in various HCC cell lines, in vivo xenograft mouse models and spontaneous liver cancer models in Ras-transgenic mice.
Here we discover that METTL3-mediated N
