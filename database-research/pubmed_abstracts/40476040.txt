Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is widely used to treat breast cancer and a pathological complete response (pCR) following NAC is associated with an optimal prognosis; however, pCR rates vary significantly.
In the present study, the effects of clinicopathological factors and the administration of different taxanes on pCR rates in patients with resectable breast cancer were assessed.
A total of 552 patients with breast cancer who received NAC between May 2019 and June 2024 were included in the present study.
The clinicopathological traits of the patients were retrieved from medical records and their association with the pCR rate was evaluated using univariate and multivariate regression analyses.
The efficacy of nanoparticle albumin-bound (Nab)-paclitaxel, docetaxel and paclitaxel liposomes in different subtypes of breast cancer were further evaluated.
A total of 189 of 552 (34.2%) patients achieved pCR following NAC.
The pCR rate varied significantly among different molecular subtypes as follows: 58.9% (96/163), 40.7% (37/91), 35.6% (37/104) and 9.8% (19/298) among patients with hormone receptor (HR) negative (-) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive (+), HR
