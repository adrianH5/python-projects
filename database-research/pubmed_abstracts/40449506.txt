In this Policy Review, we examine cancer incidence and mortality rates across Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on national cancer control plans (NCCPs) as frameworks for reducing the cancer burden in the region.
By 2022, only 16 countries had active NCCPs, with eight being cancer specific and eight being integrated into public health plans.
Our analysis found that dedicated NCCPs were linked to reduced cancer incidence but not reduced mortality.
Broader socioeconomic indicators, such as universal health coverage and a higher Human Development Index, were more strongly associated with improved cancer outcomes, including reduced mortality-to-incidence ratios.
Prevention measures such as cervical cancer screening and compliance with WHO's MPOWER tobacco control strategies also reduced cancer incidence, underscoring the importance of public health policies.
However, challenges including insufficient cancer registries, underfunding, and health-care inequities hinder NCCP implementation.
Addressing these gaps requires sustainable registries, regional evaluation frameworks, global collaboration, and stronger political commitment to ensure the success of NCCPs.
