Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) are rare structural variants involving 3 or more chromosomal breakpoints.
Most de novo-reported CCRs pose challenges for diagnosis and management.
They often require karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for clinical diagnosis because of the limitations of each method.
Here, we report an inherited, exceptionally complex CCR involving 4 chromosomes and 13 breakpoints in a family with multisystem anomalies.
