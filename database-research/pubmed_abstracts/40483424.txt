Schwannoma is a common benign tumor.
Most schwannomas are sporadic, but approximately 5% of schwannomas are multifocal.
Schwannomas are sometimes present in a skip-like pattern on a single continuous peripheral nerve (Multiple schwannomas scattered on a single peripheral nerve: MSSPN).
In this study, we present the clinical characteristics of MSSPN in the limbs and propose a treatment strategy based on treatment outcomes.
