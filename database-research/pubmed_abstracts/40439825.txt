Breast cancer surgery is a common surgical procedure often associated with acute and chronic postoperative pain.
As part of multimodal analgesia, the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) has been shown to effectively alleviate pain after breast cancer surgery.
This study is the first to apply the posterior quadratus lumborum block (posterior QLB) for perioperative analgesia in breast cancer surgery.
The aim of this research was to evaluate whether ESPB and QLB2 can relieve acute and chronic pain following breast cancer surgery.
