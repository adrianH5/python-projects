In recent years, the intricate relationship between the immune system and neurological disorders has garnered significant attention.
While the central nervous system had long been perceived as immunologically privileged, emerging research has revealed complex interactions among immune cells, inflammatory mediators, and neural components that collectively influence the pathogenesis and progression of various neurological disorders.
This comprehensive review explores the crucial role of the cytokine interleukin-17(IL-17) in neurological diseases.
It examines the complex contributions of IL-17 to both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its diverse mechanisms and its impact on neuro-immune crosstalk.
Moreover, we assess the evidence supporting the potential therapeutic role of modulating IL-17, considering its beneficial and detrimental effects.
Through a comprehensive analysis of current research, we aim to provide insights into the modulatory role of IL-17 in neurological disorders.
