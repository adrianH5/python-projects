Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) is involved primarily in histamine metabolism, but emerging evidence suggests its potential role in cancer progression.
This study investigated the role of HNMT in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and its impact on interferon (IFN) signaling, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), and p53 tumor suppressor pathways.
