Every year, many children around the world are diagnosed with cancer.
While the overall survival of pediatric patients with cancer is high and constantly improving with clinical trials and adjustments to existing treatment protocols, many of these patients experience infectious complications that contribute to morbidity and mortality.
As infectious complications pose a serious risk for these patients, it is imperative to generate and incorporate evidence-based tools into standards of care to provide optimal supportive care.
Examples of evidence-based tools that improve medical care include risk prediction models and clinical practice guidelines.
This article describes the process used to generate and implement these important supportive care tools, providing examples of their use in high-resource medical settings.
Additionally, this article further explores barriers to their use especially in low- and middle-income countries, providing examples of how to adjust for local resource availability.
By focusing on cost-effective and sustainable approaches, these tools can be used by health systems worldwide to reduce morbidity and mortality among pediatric oncology patients.
