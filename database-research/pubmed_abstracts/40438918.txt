Children, adolescents, and young adults (YAs) with cancer are using cannabis for therapeutic effects.
A systematic review of cannabis in pediatric cancer patients found most studies focused on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting with some including general symptom management.
The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of pediatric cancer patients using cannabis obtained from a medical cannabis program to manage cancer-related symptoms.
