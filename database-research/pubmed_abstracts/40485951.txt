Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with incidence rates continuously increasing, thereby posing a major healthcare challenge.
Although many oncological drugs fulfill therapeutic requirements, they often show high toxicity due to their limited specificity.
To address this problem, there has been a search for natural therapies, including animal venoms that harbor bioactive molecules with therapeutic potential, as well as biological models that facilitate their study.
Consequently, three-dimensional culture models, such as spheroids, play a pivotal role in evaluating anticancer molecules, as they can effectively mimic
