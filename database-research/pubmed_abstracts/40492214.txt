Breast cancer (BC) in low-middle income country commonly presents as large operable/locally advanced BC (LO/LABC).
Advances in treatment have gradually increased the probability of breast conservation in this population.
Hypo-fractionated whole breast radiotherapy (HF-WBI) has become the standard of care.
Literature on cosmesis in high-risk BC after HF-WBI is sparse.
Hence, we evaluated the cosmesis, late effects (LE) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) and factors affecting it in women with high-risk BC.
