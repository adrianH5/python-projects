The reticulin framework, composed mainly of type III collagen, is an essential structural component of biological tissues.
Reticulin stains, particularly silver-based methods, enable detailed visualization of reticulin framework alterations, which have been proven to be quick, low-cost, and reliable solutions for highlighting quantitative and qualitative changes of reticulin framework and have been variably associated with neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.
This review provides an updated overview of reticulin stain applications and reticulin framework assessment in endocrine and neuroendocrine neoplasms, including those of the pituitary, parathyroid, adrenal, and other neuroendocrine systems.
In pituitary neuroendocrine tumors, reticulin framework loss serves as a distinguishing feature between normal and neoplastic adenohypophysis.
Parathyroid neoplasms, including adenomas, atypical tumors, and carcinomas, exhibit varying degrees of reticulin framework disruption, which may aid in differential diagnosis.
Similarly, in adrenocortical neoplasms, reticulin framework evaluation plays a crucial role in malignancy assessment, as defined in the reticulin algorithm, which incorporates reticulin framework alterations alongside three Weiss criteria: necrosis, high mitotic count (>â€‰5/10 mm
