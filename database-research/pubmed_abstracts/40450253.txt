Unmet need for breast cancer screening refers to a situation where women within the recommended screening age group who have engaged with healthcare services in the last 12 months but have never undergone a breast examination by a healthcare professional.
Gaining insights into the extent of unmet need for breast cancer screening is essential for designing targeted interventions to improve screening uptake and reduce screening inequalities.
It is for this reason that the study sought to examine the prevalence and factors associated with unmet need for breast cancer screening among Ghanaian women.
