Presently, there is a growing popularity of assisted reproductive technology (ART).
Nevertheless, due to the significant fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels observed in patients receiving this novel technology, concerns have been raised regarding the potential increased risk of breast cancer associated with this treatment.
The outcomes of pertinent clinical investigations exhibit significant disparities, leading to a lack of consensus regarding the association between ART and susceptibility to breast cancer.
The primary objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the impact of ART on the risk of breast cancer.
