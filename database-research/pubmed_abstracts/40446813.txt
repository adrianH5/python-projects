Exposure to low-doses of ionising radiation can induce biological effects in healthcare professionals, such as DNA damage, genotoxic effects, lens opacities, and risk of cancer.
This systematic review aims to assess the current status and identify the health impacts of occupational exposure to ionising radiation.
The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.
Articles were included only if they specifically addressed the adverse biological effects of ionising radiation on healthcare professionals, particularly in medical applications.
Studies published between January 2019 and December 2023 were considered, with sources obtained from the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases.
A total of 345 articles were identified through an extensive literature search, and after the complete text screening, 32 articles were deemed suitable for inclusion in the review.
Eleven studies reported significantly higher micronuclei (MN) frequencies in workers exposed to ionising radiation compared to unexposed.
The MN studies reviewed found a significant correlation between dose or exposure time and MN frequencies.
All studies revealed significantly higher chromosomal aberrations (CA) values when exposed to ionising radiation.
The occurrence of lens opacities among interventional physicians varied significantly, with rates ranging from 16% to 47%.
This review emphasizes the high occurrence of cataracts, increased cancer risk, and the relevant frequency of MN and CA in workers chronically exposed to low doses.
