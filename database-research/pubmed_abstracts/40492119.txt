Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare and aggressive malignancy that primarily affects young people and usually occurs in the extremities.
Breast involvement is uncommon, and males with breast SS are even rarer.
We present a rare case of a 17-year-old boy with a progressively growing mass found in his right breast, which was confirmed as SS through pathological diagnosis following surgery.
