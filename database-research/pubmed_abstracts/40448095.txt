Although upper limb (UL) functionality was reported to be adversely affected in patients with breast cancer- related lymphedema (BCRL), there is currently no validated, objective performance-based assessment tool designed to evaluate UL function in this population.
The Upper Limb Functional Test (ULIFT) was adapted from the ADL test (TGlittre), which is widely used in clinical settings and research, and was developed to assess unilateral UL functionality.
Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ULIFT in patients with BCRL.
