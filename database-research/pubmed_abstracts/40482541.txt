Radiometric monitoring is important for assessing indoor exposure due to ionizing radiation from cooking dishes, particularly in Erbil, Kurdistan, where standards and guidelines are crucial.
For this purpose, a gamma-ray spectroscopy NaI (Tl) detector was used to measure the activity levels of 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K in 65 selected samples of meal dishes made of: clay, porcelain, and ceramic.
The average activity concentration levels of 226Ra in the examined samples were 65.86Â±7.08 Bq.
