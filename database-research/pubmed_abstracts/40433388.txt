Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a transformative therapeutic modality in oncology, offering unprecedented precision in targeting tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues.
In bladder cancer, a malignancy with high recurrence rates and limited treatment options, ADCs have demonstrated remarkable efficacy by targeting specific tumor-associated antigens such as NECTIN-4 and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).
This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current landscape of ADC-based therapies for bladder cancer, focusing on their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles.
