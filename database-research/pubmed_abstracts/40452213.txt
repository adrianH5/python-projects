Chordomas are rare, aggressive tumors of notochordal origin, commonly affecting the spine and skull base.
Skull Base Chordomas (SBCs) comprise approximately 39% of cases, with an incidence of less than 1 per million annually in the U.S. Prognosis remains poor due to resistance to chemotherapy, often requiring extensive surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy.
Current classification methods based on chromosomal deletions are invasive and costly, presenting a need for alternative diagnostic tools.
Radiomics allows for non-invasive SBC diagnosis and treatment planning.
