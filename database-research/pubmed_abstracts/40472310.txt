This journal club article discusses the strengths and limitations of a study from Pierret et al., which examined cancer risk for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Before this study, the relationship between MS and cancer risk was unclear because some studies suggested an increased risk while others indicated a decreased risk, highlighting a significant knowledge gap in understanding this complex connection.
It is essential to understand how MS may influence cancer susceptibility to assess treatment safety and improve patient care.
This study demonstrated that cancer risk, especially for urogenital cancers, was modestly elevated in people with MS.
