Craniopharyngiomas are rare intracranial tumors originating from the Rathke's pouch, affecting the sellar and parasellar regions.
Despite their benign nature, they cause significant morbidity and mortality due to their proximity to vital structures such as the optic pathways and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, resulting in endocrine, visual, neurological impairment, and hypothalamic syndrome.
Classified into adamantinomatous (ACP) and papillary (PCP), these tumors differ in epidemiology, histology, and pathophysiology.
ACP, the most common type, presents a bimodal peak incidence between 5 and 15 years of age and 45 and 60 years of age, while PCP is more restricted to adults.
Traditional treatments such as surgery and radiotherapy face significant challenges, including high recurrence rates.
Intracystic chemotherapy is used in monocystic ACP but with limited efficacy and adverse effects related to toxicity.
Recent advances in molecular biology have introduced targeted therapies, such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which show potential benefits in craniopharyngioma patients, particularly in the PCP.
For ACP, however, therapeutic outcomes remain limited despite advances in molecular understanding, including mutations in the
