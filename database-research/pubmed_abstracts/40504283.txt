The efficacy and safety of complement component 5 inhibitor zilucoplan in patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) were assessed in two double-blind studies (NCT03315130/NCT04115293 [RAISE]).
During these studies and the first 12 weeks of the open-label extension study, RAISE-XT, corticosteroid and non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy (NSIST) doses were kept stable; thereafter doses could be changed at the investigator's discretion.
We evaluated corticosteroid and NSIST dose changes in patients with gMG during zilucoplan treatment in RAISE-XT.
