Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain less understood.
Chronic low-grade inflammation is a complex immune response contributing to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease.
This response is signaled in part by interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic, pro-inflammatory cytokine.
Phenotypic variance in circulating IL-6 level may be explained in part by DNA methylation which is increasingly being associated with cardiovascular effects.
