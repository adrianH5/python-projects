Despite decades of efforts to find successful treatment approaches, cachexia remains a major unmet medical need.
This condition, that affects patients with diverse underlying conditions, is characterized by severe muscle loss and is associated with reduced quality of life and limited survival.
Search for underlying mechanisms that may guide cachexia treatment has mainly evolved around potential atrophy-inducing roles of inflammatory mediators, and in cancer patients, tumor-derived factors.
Recently, a new paradigm emerged as it is becoming evident that specific immune cells inhabit atrophic muscle tissue.
Arginase 1 (Arg1) expression is characteristic of these immune cells.
Studies of potential contributions of these immune cells to loss of muscle mass and function is in its infancy, and the contribution of ARG1 to these processes remains elusive.
