Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most diagnosed cancer in Australia.
With advancements in treatment and an increase in survival rates, CRC survivors face an elevated risk of developing multiple primary cancers (MPCs), presenting a clinical challenge.
Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the incidence, trend and risk of MPCs after a diagnosis of CRC in the South Australian population.
