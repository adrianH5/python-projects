Folding almanacs are magico-medical objects which were worn and used by doctors in fifteenth-century England to perform rituals of medicine and toÂ align the timing of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to earthly and cosmic cycles.
As a multimedia artist, my curiosity was taken by these hand-held objects of care.
To my contemporary eye, they are essentially artist books.
A further connection came through my own lived experience of breast cancer.
A year of intense treatment, including six cycles of chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, significantly complicated my relationship to my own body and to medicine.
This creative engagement explores how and why I tried making my own folding almanacs, using modern materials, and what I learned when one of these was accepted for Un-boxing, an international travelling exhibition.
These ancient folding almanacs encapsulate a world view where people's lived experiences of being in a body was held within a flow of relationships with other bodies, human and non-human including animals, the moon, stars and planets.
A close reading of the visual and material languages I used in this remaking offers insights into a personal health history folded into bigger questions of what we might allow into an expanded field of 'medicine'.
