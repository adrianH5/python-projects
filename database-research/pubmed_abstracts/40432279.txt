Lung disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that is more common in individuals of African American descent.
Spirometry is utilized in monitoring lung health.
Recently, the American Thoracic Society recommended the use of race-neutral predictive equations.
We aimed to evaluate how the use of race-neutral equations may affect spirometry results and interpretation in children with SCD.
