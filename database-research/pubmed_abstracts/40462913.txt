The timing of developmental transitions is critical for environmental adaptation, allowing organisms to align stress tolerant and sensitive stages with harsh and benign periods, respectively.
This timing across seasons (i.e.
phenology) is often under spatially-varying selection across climate gradients, and species often exhibit genetic clines in phenology.
Clines for transitions like germination and flowering time are well documented; less is known about the juvenile-to-adult vegetative phase change (VPC) - a conserved (among plants) yet visually subtle developmental transition marked by changes in leaf morphology and physiology.
Alternatively, developmental tradeoffs can reduce fitness differences between genotypes and promote diversity within populations.
Here, we tested 158 diverse genotypes of
