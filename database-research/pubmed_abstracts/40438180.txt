Angiogenesis in tumors is imperative to tumor growth.
Our previous studies revealed that herb-partitioned moxibustion (HPM) could delay colitis-associated cancer (CAC), but the mechanism of the effects on the angiogenesis remains largely undiscovered.
We aimed to investigate whether HPM delays CAC by inhibiting the angiogenesis with emergent three-dimensional (3D) imaging technologies.
