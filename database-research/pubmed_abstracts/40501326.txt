G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a crucial role in cellular signalling, regulating various physiological processes.
Abnormal expression and mutations of GPCRs have been implicated in several types of cancer, influencing tumour initiation, progression and immune response.
In this review, we present an overview of recent research on GPCR involvement in cancer and discuss the evidence supporting whether mutations in GPCRs act as cancer driver or passenger.
Accumulation of GPCR mutations in some highly conserved structural motifs and the mutually exclusiveness observed between G
