The Society for Women in Radiation Oncology (SWRO) was founded in 2017 with a mission to promote representation and gender equity in the field of Radiation Oncology (RO).
We aimed to assess the current experiences of SWRO members 5 years after the founding of SWRO using a comprehensive survey of gender-related workforce issues.
