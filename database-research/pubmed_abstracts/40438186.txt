The immunosuppressive roles of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in carcinogenesis make this lectin an attractive target for pharmacological inhibition in immunotherapy.
Although current clinical immunotherapies appear promising in the treatment of solid tumors, their efficacy is significantly weakened by the hostile immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).
Gal-3, a prominent TME modulator, efficiently subverts the elimination of cancer, either directly by inducing apoptosis of immune cells or indirectly by binding essential effector molecules, such as interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³).
