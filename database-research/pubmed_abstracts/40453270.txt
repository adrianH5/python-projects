This case series highlights the use of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation for refractory chronic abdominal pain in three patients who failed to respond to conventional therapies.
DRG stimulation modulates pain signals by targeting the sensory neurons present in the DRG.
The three cases involved patients with chronic abdominal pain resulting from pancreatitis, endometriosis, and pancreatic cancer.
DRG stimulation resulted in pain reductions of 100%, 90%, and 80%, respectively, accompanied by significant improvements in daily functionality and reduced analgesic use.
These findings underscore the potential of DRG stimulation as a targeted, effective treatment for refractory abdominal pain.
Further research with larger cohorts is warranted to validate these results and refine treatment protocols.
