Over the past half-century of the global effort against cancer, the vast majority of investigations in both tumor basic research and clinical practice have centered on the "somatic mutation" theory, such as in molecular classification, individualized precision medicine strategies, gene therapy approaches, the development of neoantigen-based tumor vaccines, and advancements in sequencing technologies.
Even in the extensively studied tumor microenvironment (including tumor immunity), which has garnered significant attention in recent years, the underlying mechanisms frequently revert to specific genes and mutations within tumor cells or microenvironmental cells as the primary driving forces.
However, despite the dominance of the "somatic mutation" paradigm, truly effective approaches for curing cancer in clinical settings remain elusive.
Undoubtedly, if the prevailing "somatic mutation theory" continues to monopolize cancer research, meaningful progress in understanding and treating cancer will likely remain frustratingly out of reach.
At this critical juncture in the evolution of cancer research, a comprehensive re-evaluation of cancer not only is necessary but also imperative, highlighting the urgent need for a profound transformation in our conceptual framework.
This article systematically elucidates the novel perspective offered by the "tumor system" for comprehending the essence of cancer, the foundational principles of "tumor ecology" and their potential applications in treatment, and explores in depth the theoretical framework and research significance of the emerging field of "ecological pathology".
Beyond merely advocating for the abandonment of the currently dominant linear reductionist paradigm of cancer, this commentary strives to construct a pragmatic and systematically structured framework to guide the trajectory of the "post-genomic revolution in oncology" and the "tumor ecological philosophy", ultimately fostering the realization of the overarching societal goal of eradicating cancer.
