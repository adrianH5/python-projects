Although the therapeutic options for multiple myeloma have improved survival over time, multiple myeloma tends to relapse and become refractory many times over its course.
Unfortunately, the chances of survival of the patients affected diminish with each relapse and consequent line of therapy they receive.
The management of multiple myeloma, the therapeutic agents available, and the supportive measures recommended for it have significantly evolved since the Saudi Lymphoma/Myeloma Group published its consensus statement on the management of this disease in 2019.
Since updated and clear recommendations adapted to Saudi Arabia are crucial to recognize and appropriately treat different progression patterns in order to counsel patients and healthcare payors, the Saudi Myeloma Working Group has created new recommendations for the management of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma and for the provision of supportive care for clinical specialists in Saudi Arabia to respond to these needs.
