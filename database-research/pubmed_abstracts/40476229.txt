Utilised for decades in cancer therapy, the application of photosensitisers in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy is now well explored.
In a smart wound dressing, an externally triggered antimicrobial strategy would enable on-demand infection eradication.
Hence, in this work, the light-initiated production of reactive oxygen species from photosensitiser-loaded nanocarriers was explored.
Such systems enable highly localised delivery of photosensitiser, without associated "dark toxicity" effects.
