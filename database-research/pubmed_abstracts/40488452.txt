Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) has excellent survival rates in adolescents and young adults (AYAs, diagnosed between ages 15 - 39 years).
However, survivors are at risk for treatment-related late effects.
While radiation therapy (RT) de-escalation/omission has emerged as an approach to minimize late effects, no prior studies have evaluated RT use over time in AYAs with HL.
