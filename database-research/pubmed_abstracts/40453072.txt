IL-17A-expressing lymphocytes, including Tc17 cells, are instrumental in immunity, immunopathology, and autoimmunity.
We have previously shown that experimental attenuated live fungal vaccine-induced Tc17 cells are stable, long-lived without plasticity, and necessary to mediate sterilizing immunity during CD4
