A paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) describes the neurological complications of a malignancy that are not due to local or metastatic effects.
PNS are often associated with the presence of serum paraneoplastic neuronal antibodies (PNAb).
However, the frequency of identification of PNAb in hospitals and laboratories is rarely reported.
This information will help plan and deliver diagnostic and clinical services.
