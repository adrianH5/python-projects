Persistent oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a key risk factor for head and neck cancers, is well-studied in Western populations but less understood elsewhere.
This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of oral HPV infection by genotype among Taiwanese adults, stratified by sex and age, and identify associated risk factors.
