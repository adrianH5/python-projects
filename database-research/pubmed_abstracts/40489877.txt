A referral from a primary physician is a crucial initial diagnostic intervention for the management of osteosarcoma.
We reviewed the awareness of primary physicians regarding the radiological findings of osteosarcoma through their referral documents.
Referral documents of 40 patients (27 male and 13 female; median age, 19 [8-81] years) with osteosarcoma were retrospectively investigated.
The documents were examined for suggested supplementary radiological procedures, presence or absence of a descriptive keyword for the radiological findings of osteosarcoma, periosteal reaction, matrix, soft tissue mass, type of border of the lesion, and type of bone destruction, followed by an assessment of the diagnostic radiologists' findings.
The keywords "periosteal reaction," "matrix," "soft tissue extension," "border of the lesion," and "type of bone destruction" were described in 5 (7.5%), 5 (15%), 4 (10%), 0 (0%), and 7 (17.5%) cases by the primary physicians, respectively.
Records with "periosteal reaction," "matrix," "soft tissue mass," "type of border of the lesion," and "type of bone destruction" were described in 5 (31.25%), 5 (31.25%), 10 (62.5%), 3 (18.8%), and 3 (18.8%) radiologic findings of the diagnostic radiologists, respectively.
The descriptions of keywords for radiological findings suggesting osteosarcoma in referral documents from primary physicians seemed generally insufficient.
More enhanced and comprehensive awareness of the typical radiological findings of osteosarcoma is necessary to prevent diagnostic delays.
