Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can either be examined with hybrid PET/MR imaging systems or sequentially, using PET/CT and MR imaging.
Regardless of the acquisition technique, the superiority of MR imaging compared to CT lies in its potential to interrogate tumor and surrounding tissues with different sequences, including perfusion and diffusion.
For this reason, PET/MR imaging is preferable for the detection and assessment of locoregional residual/recurrent HNSCC after therapy.
In addition, MR imaging interpretation is facilitated when combined with PET.
Nevertheless, distant metastases and distant second primary tumors are detected equally well with PET/MR imaging and PET/CT.
