Alterations in BRCA1/2 (BRCA) and other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes have a negative impact on outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, the only treatment demonstrated to improve the prognosis of patients with mCRPC, are also being developed for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).
To fully assess their potential benefit in this setting, it is essential to understand how BRCA and HRR defects may influence the prognosis of conventionally treated patients with low and high disease volume.
