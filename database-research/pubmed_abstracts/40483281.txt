Thyroid cancer (THCA) is profoundly influenced by its immune microenvironment, with dendritic cells (DCs) serving as key mediators of tumor-immune interactions.
This study leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing and transcriptome RNA sequencing to analyze DC populations in THCA tissues.
The results revealed significant disparities in DC distribution and function, with formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) emerging as a crucial factor associated with patient prognosis.
Meta-analysis further validated the differential expression of FPR1, reinforcing its significance in THCA progression.
Investigations into the TME highlighted the relationship between FPR1 and DC maturation and activation, elucidating the mechanistic basis for immune regulation.
Experimental validation confirmed that Annexin A1 (ANXA1) interacts with FPR1 in DCs, promoting tumor progression through immune modulation.
These findings advance the understanding of THCA immune mechanisms and underscore the potential of targeting the ANXA1-FPR1 axis as a novel approach for immunotherapy in THCA.
