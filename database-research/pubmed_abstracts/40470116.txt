Currently, preoperative diagnostic methods that can distinguish cancer from benign disease of the gallbladder are insufficient, and several surgical resections can be avoided if the pathology is known prior to surgery.
This study aimed to assess whether preoperative plasma proteins can distinguish gallbladder cancer (GBC) from cholecystitis, with the main goal of identifying proteins for multivariate description of the postoperative diagnosis, before surgery.
