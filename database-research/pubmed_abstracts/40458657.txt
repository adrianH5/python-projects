Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates for combating multidrug-resistant infections, but their clinical application is often limited by challenges such as poor selectivity and high cytotoxicity.
This study aimed to optimize the therapeutic potential of brevinin-1pl, a frog-derived AMP with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activities.
