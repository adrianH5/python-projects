Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) constitutes 10-15% of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
EFS is 70% and currently 80% with the additional of targeted agents such as CD30 directed conjugated monoclonal antibody brentuximab or ALK inhibitors such as crizotinib.
Expression of CD3, a T-cell marker, can be lost or diminished in some ALCL cases.
The literature is conflicting on whether CD3 expression affects prognosis, and it has been analyzed mostly in the relapse setting.
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of CD3 expression on survival and its relation to the other prognostic variables in newly diagnosed patients with pediatric ALCL treated at a single large pediatric oncology center.
