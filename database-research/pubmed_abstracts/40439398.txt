Globally, lung cancer continues to be the primary cause of both cancer incidence and death.
The disease is multifaceted, influenced by numerous external factors and the individual's genetic or epigenetic predisposition to its onset and timing.
Upon diagnosis, fewer than one-third of patients present with localized disease amenable to curative multimodal therapy; the remainder have metastatic disease.
Currently, numerous treatments are ineffective due to resistance to standard medications or the emergence of distant metastases.
Plant-derived natural compounds have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their high permeability and low toxicity.
Piper longum, Piper nigrum, Zingiber officinalis, Emblica officinale, Terminalia bellirica, Terminalia chebula, Drynaria quercifolia, Phyllanthus amarus, and Eclipta prostrata are traditional Indian herbs with diverse pharmacological properties.
This study assessed the efficacy of active chemicals from the polyherbal formulation on lung cancer target proteins by molecular docking.
Preliminary and qualitative phytochemical Antioxidant testing indicated significant pharmacological effects.
Moreover, the formulation exhibited modest anti-inflammatory and significant apoptotic action.
These findings validate the therapeutic effectiveness of this polyherbal mixture for cancer treatment.
Nonetheless, it is imperative to perform further preclinical research to elucidate the mechanisms of action of the molecule, as well as its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features.
