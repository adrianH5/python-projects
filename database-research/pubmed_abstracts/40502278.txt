This work describes the architecture design of a patient-facing technology (PFT) based on the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform and other tools to support cancer patients in self-tracking and managing medication concerns and symptoms during transitions of care.
The design is guided by the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and User-Centered Design (UCD) principles for a personalized application to inform, engage, and empower patients.
We describe the evolutional details of four major versions, which represent milestones of our PFT, highlighting how specific objectives were achieved and the barriers encountered.
Additionally, patient representatives were involved in the evaluation of prototypes, and potential improvements to the application of the REDCap platform were discussed.
REDCap has demonstrated great potential to serve beyond its traditional role as a survey distribution and management tool.
This work is intended to provide developers with insights into future PFT architecture development and sustainable research strategies.
