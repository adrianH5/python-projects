Across patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is one of the most widely used among patients with cancer.
Patients may also complete other PROMs such as forms of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).
The objective of this study was to develop crosswalks between the EORTC QLQ-C30 physical, role, social and emotional functioning, fatigue and global health status/QoL scales and their corresponding PROMIS scales.
