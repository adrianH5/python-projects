Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) is a rare lung tumor with a distinctive histology of goblet and columnar cells characterized by diverse growth patterns.
The outcomes and prognosis of IMA are poorly defined owing to its rarity.
This study uses the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to study the demographic and prognostic factors affecting the overall survival and mortality rates of IMA patients.
We identified IMA patients from the NCDB (2004-2020) using ICD-O-3 code 8253.
Time-to-event outcomes were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier, log-rank tests, and Cox regression models to assess factors influencing survival.
A total of 6202 IMA patients were identified.
Older age was linked to poorer survival (2-year = 53.6%, 5-year = 30.9%, 10-year = 12.4%).
Female patients had better survival rates than males (2-year = 70.8% vs. 60.7%, p < 0.001).
Lower income (< $46,277 and $46,227-$57,856) and lack of radiation therapy were associated with higher mortality (HR = 1.35, p < 0.001).
Medicaid insurance also correlated with worse survival compared to private insurance (HR = 1.46, p < 0.001).
Male gender, Black or White race, and lower income brackets were associated with increased mortality in IMA.
Further, being insured by Medicaid and not undergoing radiation therapy are associated with poorer survival outcomes.
