Managing postoperative pain in lung cancer patients remains challenging.
Pain threshold (PT), an objective indicator reflecting the body's sensitivity to pain, can be used to predict postoperative pain.
This study aims to investigate the dynamic trajectory of perioperative pain threshold in lung cancer patients, hypothesizing that heterogeneity exists in the pain threshold trajectories.
