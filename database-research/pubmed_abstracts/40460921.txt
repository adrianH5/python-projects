With a prevalence reaching 80% in terminal cancer patients,Cancer cachexia (CC) manifests as irreversible skeletal muscle wasting.
Presently, there exists no effective therapeutic strategy for managing cancer cachexia.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) contributes significantly to the management of CC, enhancing quality of life and potentially prolonging survival in affected patients.
Bu-zhong-yi-qi decoction (BYD), a classical Chinese formulation, demonstrates therapeutic potential for tumor-associated conditions and muscle-related disorders.
However, its precise pharmacological mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
