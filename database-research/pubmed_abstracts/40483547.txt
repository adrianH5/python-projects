Depicting a global landscape of essential gene-targeting drugs would provide more opportunities for cancer therapy.
However, a systematic investigation on drugs targeting essential genes still has not been reported.
We suppose that drugs targeting cancer-type-specific essential genes would generally have less toxicity than those targeting pan-cancer essential genes.
A scoring function-based strategy was developed to identify cancer-type-specific targets and drugs.
The EssentialitySpecificityScore ranked the essential genes in 19 cancer types, and 1151 top genes were identified as cancer-type-specific targets.
Combining target-drug interaction databases with research/marketing status, 370 cancer-type-specific drugs were identified, bound to 100 out of all identified targets.
Profiles of applied cancer types of identified targets and drugs illustrate the scoring strategy's effectiveness: most drugs apply to cancer types <10.
Seven drugs with no previous anticancer evidence were validated in 11 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and lower inhibition rates (from 9.4% to 44.0%) were observed in 10 normal cell lines.
This difference is statistically significant (Student's t-test, P ≤ .0001), confirming the rationality of our supposition.
Our built EGKG (Essential Gene Knowledge Graph) forms a computational basis to uncover essential gene targets and drugs for specific cancer types.
It is available at http://gepa.org.cn/egkg/.
Also, our experimental result suggests that combining drugs with orthogonal essentiality may be an alternative way to improve anticancer effects while maintaining biocompatibility.
