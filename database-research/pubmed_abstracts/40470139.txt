A 76-year-old man with extensive disease small cell lung cancer underwent airway stenting for right bronchus intermedius stenosis.
The stent self-expectorated after initiating chemoimmunotherapy due to tumour shrinkage.
Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of stent migration in malignant central airway obstruction patients who respond to chemotherapy.
