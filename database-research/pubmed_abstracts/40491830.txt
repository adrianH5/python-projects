Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has become a critical factor in determining the benefits of new surgical approaches on patients.
The ORANGE II PLUS randomised trial compared laparoscopic (LH) and open (OH) hemihepatectomy in an international multicentre randomised controlled setting, with HRQoL as a secondary outcome.
The aim of this study was to perform an in-depth analysis of the HRQoL outcomes.
