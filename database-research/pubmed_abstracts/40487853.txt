Non-Bacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE) is characterized by the formation of sterile vegetations on the heart valves, often due to an underlying hypercoagulable state in the setting of malignancy, inflammation, or autoimmune disease.
NBTE is a rare condition with a reported incidence rate of between 0.9% and 1.6%.
Among gynecologic malignancies, NBTE is predominantly observed in ovarian cancer.
A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to understand the association between NBTE and ovarian cancer.
