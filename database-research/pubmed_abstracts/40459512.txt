The subventricular zone (SVZ), the brain's largest neural stem cells reservoir, plays a critical role in glioblastoma development and progression.
This study aims to investigate the association between MRI features and SVZ contact in IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, as well as their prognostic significance to guide personalized diagnosis and treatment.
