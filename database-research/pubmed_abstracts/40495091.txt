Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor of hepatobiliary epithelial cells.
In recent years, its incidence has gradually increased.
It has a very high fatality rate and low survival rate, and the existing predictive factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are unclear.
The role of anoikis, a form of programmed cell death, in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is not fully understood.
This study focuses on identifying and analyzing anoikis-related differentially expressed genes in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, aiming to enhance our understanding of potential treatment strategies and prognosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
