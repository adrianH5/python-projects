Previous studies found that patients with a history of cancer either have similar outcomes or face an increased risk of early morbidity following cardiac surgery.
However, the applicability of these findings to clinical practice may be constrained by the heterogeneity of cancer patients.
To refine our understanding, this study focuses specifically on the in-hospital outcomes of patients with non-metastatic malignant solid tumors (NMST) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
