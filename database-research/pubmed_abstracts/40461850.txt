Overweight and obesity are substantial, growing public health concerns due to their huge direct and indirect negative impact on health.
Obesity-associated complications and comorbid conditions include metabolic, cardiovascular, renal, liver and respiratory diseases, cancers, and functional limitations, leading to higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and incident disability.
The development of rigorous guidelines considering and comparing all possible therapeutic strategies is of critical importance, and a relevant tool for improving the quality of care and increasing the appropriateness of therapeutic choices.
The Italian National Institute of Health (ISS-Istituto Superiore di Sanità) appointed the Italian Obesity Society (SIO-Società Italiana dell'Obesità) and other key scientific societies with a relevant stakeholder role on the theme issue to design and develop a new Italian guideline for the management of obesity in adult subjects, aimed at assisting healthcare professionals in the consideration of lifestyle, pharmacological, endoscopic, and surgical options for the treatment of overweight and obesity, as well as related conditions.
We adopted Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology, strongly endorsed by Istituto Superiore di Sanità to develop trustworthy guidelines to be accepted onto Sistema Nazionale Linee Guida, the reference repository of national clinical practice guidelines for the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale.
