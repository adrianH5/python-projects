The Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander (AANHPI) population are heterogeneous in health risk factors, socioeconomic status, and health outcomes.
Disaggregating AANHPI groups may reveal disparities in cancer incidence.
The aim of this study was to examine patterns and trends in incidence of common gastrointestinal cancers in AANHPI groups compared to the non-Hispanic White (NHW) population.
