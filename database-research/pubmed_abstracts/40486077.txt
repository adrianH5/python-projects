We have previously reported that pre-transplant use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is independently associated with the occurrence of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA).
However, the precise TKI-related factors which predispose to TA-TMA are unknown.
In this retrospective analysis, we identify the TKI-related factors that are associated with TA-TMA.
