Carcinoma of the eyelid is a specific anatomical variant of skin cancer, notable for its proximity to the eye.
Surgery is the gold standard for managing eyelid cancer, while radiotherapy can serve as an alternative for patients unfit for surgery or as an adjunct treatment.
Various devices in maxillofacial prosthodontics are used in conjunction with head and neck radiotherapy to protect the healthy tissues surrounding the irradiation site.
These devices are designed by a maxillofacial prosthodontics specialist in collaboration with a radiotherapist/oncologist.
