Obesity is a chronic disease that affects millions of adults and children globally.
Obesity is particularly prevalent in the US and is associated with adiposity-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, cancer, and reduced quality of life.
The Obesity Medicine Association's 4 pillars of obesity treatment are nutrition therapy, physical activity, behavioral counseling, and medical interventions, the latter of which includes pharmacotherapy, complication management, and bariatric procedures.
Long-term obesity treatment using these treatment modalities guides chronic disease management to achieve sustained weight reduction, improved health outcomes, and improved quality of life.
