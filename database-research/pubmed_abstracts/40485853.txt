As the demand for end-of-life care increases, the development of a well-structured training and certification system for palliative medicine specialists is becoming increasingly important.
In South Korea, a certification system for palliative care physicians has been in place since 2019, managed by the Korean Society for Hospice and Palliative Care.
To further develop this certification system and training process, this review aims to describe hospice and palliative medicine certification programs across eight countries/regions-the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea-to identify key differences and draw insights for enhancing Korea's physician training and certification system.
Most countries/regions recognize hospice and palliative medicine as medical subspecialty and provide standardized training and certification pathways.
Training durations range from 1-year fellowships to multiyear structured programs with clinical experience.
Japan's tiered certification system offers a flexible approach based on care settings and physicians' expertise.
However, Korea's system lacks in-depth clinical experience and government recognition, limiting its sustainability.
To strengthen palliative care in Korea, it is essential to enhance training duration, expand clinical exposure, and foster multispecialty collaboration.
A tiered certification system adapted to Korea's healthcare environment and supported by government policy could improve both the quality and reach of palliative care services.
These findings can inform future policy and educational reforms to ensure more effective and sustainable training of palliative care professionals in Korea.
