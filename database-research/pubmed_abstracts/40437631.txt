Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by challenging early diagnosis, limited therapeutic options, and a poor prognosis.
Diabetes mellitus, marked by altered glucose metabolism, has emerged as a significant risk factor for PDAC development, highlighting a complex, bidirectional pathogenic relationship.
This review systematically examines the intricate interactions between diabetes and PDAC, emphasizing their shared pathophysiological mechanisms.
A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms can inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies, potentially improving patient outcomes by concurrently managing diabetes and pancreatic cancer.
We further evaluate current biomarker screening approaches for PDAC within diabetic subpopulations, assess the effectiveness of screening programs among high-risk groups, and propose practical strategies for the early identification and monitoring of PDAC.
Early detection in diabetic individuals through targeted biomarker screening followed by timely therapeutic intervention may significantly reduce mortality, improve survival rates, and extend patient longevity.
In conclusion, an integrated approach combining early diagnosis, targeted treatments, and a detailed understanding of the underlying pathogenesis represents the most promising strategy for enhancing clinical outcomes and survival among diabetic patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
