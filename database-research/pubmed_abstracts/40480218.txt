Over the past five years, allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-engineered cell therapies have advanced rapidly.
By bypassing the individualized manufacturing, high cost, and eligibility constraints of autologous products, allogeneic platforms, especially those derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), promise broader, faster access for cancer patients.
This perspective reviews recent preclinical and clinical milestones, outlining genetic designs, scalable production workflows, and early-phase trial outcomes.
We assess safety profiles, antitumor activity, and in vivo persistence, spotlighting innovations like T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) knockout, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) camouflage, and interleukin (IL)-15 armoring.
Finally, we identify emerging trends and challenges that will shape the future development of allogeneic iPSC-derived CAR therapies.
