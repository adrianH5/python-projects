Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare mediastinal tumors that originate in the thymus.
Patients with thymoma may experience symptoms associated with autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases (such as myasthenia gravis), which typically do not occur in patients with thymic carcinoma.
The NCCN Guidelines for Thymomas and Thymic Carcinomas provide guidance for the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma.
Involvement of a multidisciplinary team with experience treating thymomas and thymic carcinomas is highly recommended.
