Since the introduction of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) as the first-line treatment for metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer, there has been a significant expansion in the number of therapeutic options for subsequent lines of therapy.
Many new agents are being studied, with potential for future regulatory approval.
The increased number of therapeutic options raises questions about the optimal selection and sequencing of therapies for individual patients.
These advances represent an important clinical challenge in this rapidly evolving field, given the introduction of new therapies targeting various pathways (alone or in combination) and new therapeutic classes being studied.
