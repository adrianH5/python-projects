Intraoperative frozen section analysis (IOFS) is a widely used method for evaluating ovarian masses and guiding surgical decisions.
However, IOFS is not always accessible in low-resource settings.
Recent research suggests that intraoperative cytology (IOC) may offer a quicker, less equipment-dependent alternative.
This study aims to compare IOC and IOFS in women with ovarian neoplasms.
The pathologists interpreting IOC were blinded to IOFS findings.
