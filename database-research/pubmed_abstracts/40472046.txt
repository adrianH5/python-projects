Current clinical care may not address behavioural and psychosocial elements which can influence quality of life (QoL) and recurrence risk of people living with and beyond cancer (PLWBC).
There is a lack of validated tools to assess diet, lifestyle and mental health in PLWBC.
We have developed a screener to identify individuals who may need further support beyond cancer recurrence.
The aim is two-fold: 1) validate the screener in PLWBC; and 2) carry out a pilot feasibility study (PFS) to explore the impact of a lifestyle complex intervention (diet, physical activity and mental health components) on the QoL of PLWBC.
