Oral submucosal fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic oral mucosal disease with a cancerization tendency, characterized by restricted mouth opening and dysphagia.
Currently, the mainstay treatment is still the local corticosteroid injection.
Curcumin can reconstruct the redox balance, inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and suppress the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) collagen, making it a promising treatment for fibrotic diseases.
However, curcumin has poor intestinal absorption and low bioavailability, which limits its efficacy in treating oral mucosa diseases.
