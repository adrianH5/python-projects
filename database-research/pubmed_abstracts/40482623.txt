Understanding airborne particle mass deposition in the lungs is crucial for assessing health effects, particularly in regions with severe air pollution.
While several studies have modelled lung deposition, there is limited information on lung tissue deposition that incorporates factors like hygroscopicity and density in polluted environments or source-specific exposures.
This study examines the impact of atmospheric aerosol properties, including particle number size distribution, effective density, and hygroscopic growth, on lung tissue deposition using data from a measurement campaign in Delhi, India.
Using the Hygroscopic Particle Lung Deposition (HPLD) model, the number (TD
