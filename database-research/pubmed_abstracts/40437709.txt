Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) improves disease control by reducing relapse risk but is associated with higher non-relapse mortality (NRM).
Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) aims to minimize toxicity but raises concerns about higher relapse rates.
This study evaluates the impact of RIC versus MAC in AML patients under 65â€‰years receiving GVHD prophylaxis with antithymocyte globulin, post-transplant cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine.
