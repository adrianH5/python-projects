Numerous studies have established that oxidative stress significantly affects the long-term survival of cancer survivors.
However, there is currently no comprehensive measure to assess oxidative stress levels in these individuals that associates with all-cause, cause-specific, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.
This study aims to investigate the relationship between Oxidative Balance Score (OBS) in American cancer survivors and their risks of all-cause, cancer-specific, and CVD mortality.
