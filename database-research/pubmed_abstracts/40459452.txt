Implant-based reconstruction is not always feasible when mastectomy flap viability is poor.
Rather than returning to the operating room for staged breast reconstruction with tissue expansion (TE), patients may instead opt for delayed direct to implant (dDTI) reconstruction.
This study aimed to assess the feasibility of dDTI after patients "go flat" after their mastectomy.
