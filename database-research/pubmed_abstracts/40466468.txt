DPYD-guided dosing enhances safety of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.
However, approximately 23â€¯% of patients still experience severe toxicity unexplained by the four commonly tested DPYD-variant alleles.
Elevated pre-treatment uracil levels have been proposed as a surrogate marker for reduced DPD activity and an independent predictor of toxicity.
This prospective study evaluated whether uracil-guided dose individualisation can reduce severe fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity in DPYD wild-type patients.
