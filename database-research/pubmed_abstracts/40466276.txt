Approximately 70 % of patients with breast cancer (BC) have estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors.
Endocrine therapy is the principal treatment for these patients.
Tamoxifen (TAM), a selective ER modulator, is commonly administered to premenopausal patients with ER-positive BC.
However, resistance to TAM poses a major clinical hurdle as TAM-resistant BC cells often show increased proliferation and motility as well as undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
