With the advancement of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the reliance on surgical removal of axillary for high-risk breast cancer is diminishing.
However, there is a lack of data on the oncologic safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) alone in patients with clinical node stages 2 and 3 who show a favorable response to NAC.
This study aims to compare the oncologic outcomes of SNB alone versus SNB combined with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in this patient cohort.
