Lung cancer is strongly associated with malnutrition and detrimental changes in muscle mass (MM), which can lead to reduced quality of life and reduced tolerance to and efficacy of antineoplastic treatment.
The loss of MM and myosteatosis (fat infiltration into muscle) have been linked to inflammation in cancer, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) found in fish oil are known to modulate inflammatory response, lean mass, microbiota, and epigenetic mechanisms.
