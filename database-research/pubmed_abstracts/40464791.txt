The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model integrating sarcopenia, PEGylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-G-CSF) administration, and conventional risk factors to predict febrile neutropenia (FN) and grade 4 neutropenia (G4 NP) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with R-CHOP.
