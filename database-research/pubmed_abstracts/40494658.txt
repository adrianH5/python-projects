Immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease is an autoimmune condition characterized histologically by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, obliterative phlebitis, and storiform fibrosis.
Orbital hemangioma is one of the most common primary orbital tumors in adults.
The coexistence of immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease and orbital hemangioma is extremely rare.
This report presents the case of a man in his early 30s diagnosed with immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease.
He was treated with glucocorticoid therapy and gamma knife radiosurgery.
Herein, we described the clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathology, treatment, and outcomes of this rare case to provide a reference for future diagnosis and management.
