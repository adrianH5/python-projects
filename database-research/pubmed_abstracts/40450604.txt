In recent years, the incidence of the upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma has risen significantly, but its early symptoms are insidious and its diagnosis lags behind, leading to poor prognosis of patients.
Therefore, the exploration of novel biomarkers and precise therapeutic targets has become an urgent clinical problem.
lncRNAs, as key molecules in tumour regulation, are involved in the regulation of malignant processes, such as proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis resistance of tumour cells through epigenetic modification, activation or inhibition of signaling pathways, and other mechanisms.
Therefore, lncRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
The aim of this paper is to systematically study the functional roles of lncRNAs in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinogenesis and development, to summarize the known effects of lncRNAs on upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, to explore the effects of differential expression of lncRNAs on tumor progression, and to investigate the related signal transduction pathways.
Also, the potential of lncRNAs as biomarkers and early diagnostic therapeutic targets will be initially explored.
These studies will provide strong theoretical support for the clinical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
