Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is related to the pathogenesis of Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
However, the molecular mechanism of how TMAO causes MAFLD development is still unclear.
The present study attempted to investigate whether TMAO contributes to MAFLD development through HULC in a cellular model of MAFLD.
