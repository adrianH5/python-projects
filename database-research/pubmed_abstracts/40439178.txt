Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive sarcoma with a low metastatic potential.
This report describes a 73-year-old woman with a history of recurrent scalp dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans who presented with an asymptomatic pulmonary nodule detected via computed tomography.
The nodule, which gradually enlarged over four years, was confirmed as metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans through wedge resection and histopathological analysis.
This case emphasizes that hematogenous spread to the lungs should be considered in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans patients with a history of recurrence, particularly when pulmonary nodules are detected.
