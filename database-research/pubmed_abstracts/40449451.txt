Cardiotoxicity is a prevalent side effect linked to anthracyclines, a class of chemotherapy drugs, that frequently leads to the discontinuation of anthracycline-based treatments among cancer patients.
Thus, there is a pressing need to mitigate and prevent these cardiotoxic effects.
Mounting evidence suggests that Traditional Chinese Medicine may alleviate the toxic side effects of chemotherapy agents.
For this reason, this study seeked to comprehensively assess the cardioprotective properties of the Qishen Huanwu capsule (QSHWC) against pirarubicin (THP)-induced cardiotoxicity in rat models and explore the underlying mechanisms.
