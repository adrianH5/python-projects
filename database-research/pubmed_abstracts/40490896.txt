Anti-tumor necrosis factor-Î± inhibitors (anti-TNFs) are the established treatment for perianal Crohn's disease (pCD), but relapse and non-response are common.

We present the first direct comparison of 2nd - and 3rd -line biologics in pCD patients with active perianal disease previously treated with 1st-line anti-TNFs.
