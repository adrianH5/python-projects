Sinonasal NUT carcinoma is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis.
This case demonstrates that combined surgical resection, high-dose radiotherapy, and chemotherapy can lead to long-term remission, with the patient remaining disease-free after five years.
Early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial.
Continued research into targeted therapies like BET inhibitors holds promise for improving outcomes in this rare, challenging tumor.
