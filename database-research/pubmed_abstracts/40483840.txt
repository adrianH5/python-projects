Several genetic and immunologic biomarkers have shown promise in detecting pancreatic cancer, predicting its progression, monitoring the treatment, and evaluating responses.
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in biomarker discovery and liquid biopsy for pancreatic cancer.
We summarized the biomarkers with prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic value, highlighting their individual and combined utility in pancreatic cancer.
Moreover, the clinical value of the biomarkers remains to be fully established, and this review discusses the current limitations and complexities associated with these biomarkers and their clinical interpretation.
The future direction of novel approaches is discussed, which could shed light on early diagnosis and monitoring of pancreatic cancer.
Given the low sensitivity and the impact of co-morbidities on biomarker levels, no single biomarker is sufficient for detection, and establishing an appropriate approach that consists of conventional and non-conventional biomarkers is crucial to obtaining a standardized diagnostic method.
