Interferon-b (IFN-Î²), a glycoprotein released during viral infections, plays a crucial role in modulating T cells involved in multiple sclerosis (MS).
CD200 is an immunomodulatory molecule expressed in many cell types, including neurons.
It reduces the progression of MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by interacting with CD200R, mainly expressed on myeloid lineage cells.
This interaction prevents brain damage and slows the progression of the disease.
