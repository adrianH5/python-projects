SYTL4 (Synaptotagmin Like 4) encodes a protein of synaptotagmin like protein family,Â which participates in intracellular membrane trafficking.
Currently, its role and mechanisms in cancer remain unveiled, necessitating additional comprehensive analysis across different types of cancer to assess its potential in diagnosis, prognosis, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in cancer.
In our study, the mRNA level, threshold for copy number alterations, segmentation of masked copy number alterations, and methylation of SYTL4 DNA were analyzed based on data from TCGA pan-cancer cohort.
miRNA, TCPA, mutation and clinical data were analyzed to evaluate diagnostic and prognostic significances of SYTL4.
Then the results were checked using cBioPortal and GEO database.
The protein levels were analyzed and evaluated based on HPA database and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC).
Biological roles of SYTL4 in pan-cancer were explored by GSEA.
We use multiple immune infiltration algorithms in TIMER2.0 and TISCH database to cross-verify the associations between SYTL4 expression and tumor immune microenvironment.
Additionally, we depicted a pan-cancer survival map and explored the differences of gene expressions among cancers with different molecular subtypes.
Through chemotherapy data from CellMiner, GDSC, CTRP database, we clarified the relationship between SYTL4 and drug resistance.
Finally, we explored the chemical substances that affect SYTL4 expression through CTD database.
This study systematically and comprehensively reveals the functions of SYTL4 and potential clinical diagnostic and therapeutic predictive values of SYTL4 in pan-cancer.
