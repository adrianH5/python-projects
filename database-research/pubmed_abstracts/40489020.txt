Ovarian Cancer (OC) is a serious health problem that affects a great number of women globally.
It is still one of the deadliest gynecological cancers due to restricted treatment choices and late-stage diagnosis.
Worldwide, OC ranks as the seventh most commonly diagnosed kind of malignant neoplasm in women and the eighth leading cause of death in them.
Because of several reasons such as genetic and economic ones, the epidemiology of OC shows disparities between races and countries.
Lack of public screening program makes it difficult to diagnose this cancer earlier and as a result, most OCs are detected after they have progressed to other parts.
However, advances in biotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming both early detection and treatment strategies.
Over the years, the application of AI in OC screening has shown promising results.
The best way to get the drawbacks of traditional treatment methods is to combine newly developed strategies with existing treatment choices.
Additionally, clinical researches are crucial to ensure the practical implementation of these advancements in healthcare settings.
Utilizing state-of-the-art technologies and creative strategies will offer significant opportunity to lessen the worldwide impact of this curable cancer thereby enhancing women's quality of life in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and beyond.
Hence, this review explores recent breakthroughs in ovarian cancer screening and therapy, highlighting the synergistic role of biotechnology and AI in improving patient outcomes that reshapes the ovarian cancer treatment landscape.
