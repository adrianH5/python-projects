Current treatments for glioblastoma face challenges such as the blood-brain barrier and lack of targeted therapy, compounded by the aggressive nature, high invasiveness, and heterogeneity of the disease.
Exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicles are emerging as promising nanocarrier drug delivery systems to address these limitations.
Exosomes released by all cell types can be easily obtained and modified as delivery vehicles or therapeutic agents.
A systematic review was conducted to evaluate various methods for exosome isolation, characterization, engineering or modification, drug loading and delivery efficiency, including exosome biodistribution and treatment efficacy.
A search of four databases for
