Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is a common challenge in cancer treatments, and its pharmacological management often has limited efficacy and various side effects.
Terpinolene (TPO), a bioactive molecule from essential oils, displays promising potential as adjuvant therapy to overcome the side effects of chemotherapy without compromising its efficacy.
Here, we show the effect of TPO on paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain (PINP) in mice and its underlying mechanisms.
First, TPO reduced mechanical and cold allodynia as well as thermal hyperalgesia in mice with PINP in acute and subacute settings.
Furthermore, TPO restored altered reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the serum of mice with PINP.
At the same time, docking analysis showed that TPO had the most negative average binding energies with serotonergic receptors (5-HT3) and α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC).
In vivo analyses showed that TPO antinociceptive action include opioidergic (MOR) and serotonergic (5HT2A and 5HT3) systems, as well as ATP-sensitive potassium channels.
Moreover, TPO was non cytotoxic in glia derived cells U-87 and normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10).
Paclitaxel (PTX) and TPO combination exhibited a synergistic effect in inhibiting the growth of triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231).
Taken together, these findings suggest that TPO may represent a promising pharmacological strategy for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, by virtue of its combined antinociceptive and antiproliferative properties.
