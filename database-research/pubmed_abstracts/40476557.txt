Brain tumours are in the spotlight of oncology research due to their intractability and resistance to conventional treatments.
High‑risk craniotomies must be performed on patients during tumour resection surgeries due to the specificity of the brain structure, and the complexity of the brain structure also leads to the fact that brain tumours usually cannot be removed completely.
Besides, the inability of foreign small molecules to cross the blood‑brain barrier has led to the inability of conventional drug therapy to reach the tumour location in the brain.
Furthermore, the damage to healthy brain tissue caused by conventional radiotherapy cannot be ignored.
Therefore, brain tumours represented by gliomas are in urgent need for a novel therapeutic approach.
Glioma is the most common brain tumour, accounting for 81% of malignant tumours in the central nervous system, and is characterized by high morbidity, recurrence, mortality and low cure rate.
In recent years, natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy for gliomas has gradually emerged and numerous studies have shown surprising therapeutic effects.
NK cells have been demonstrated to traverse the blood‑brain barrier and numerous studies have confirmed their ability to kill glioma cells both
