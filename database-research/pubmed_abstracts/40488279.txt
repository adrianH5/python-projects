Although the presence of Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutations predicts a failure of non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) patients to benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy it may be more sensitive to programmed combination therapy of programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors + anti-angiogenesis.
Recent treatment guidelines and clinical studies related to adenocarcinoma in NSCLC have indicated that in patients with inoperable stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs may exert a synergistic effect and significantly improve the efficacy of near-term treatment, but quantification and long-term follow-up of specific clinical indicators are still lacking.
No previous cases of long-term good results with camrelizumab combined with anti-angiogenic agents for KRAS-mutated NSCLC have been described.
