Multistate models, which allow the prediction of complex multistate survival processes such as multimorbidity, or recovery, relapse and death following treatment for cancer, are being used for clinical prediction.
It is paramount to evaluate the calibration (as well as other metrics) of a risk prediction model before implementation of the model.
While there are a number of software applications available for developing multistate models, currently no software exists to aid in assessing the calibration of a multistate model, and as a result evaluation of model performance is uncommon.
calibmsm has been developed to fill this gap.
