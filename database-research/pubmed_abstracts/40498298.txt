Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is the primary tool for assessing tumor response in solid tumors.
Immunotherapy elicits unique response patterns, and assessment of their contribution to overall survival (OS) is of interest.
We evaluated tumor size changes (TSC) for association with OS, evaluated whether deeper response had greater association with OS than the 30% RECIST cutoff, and quantified the contribution of objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) to OS benefit using data from KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 examining first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
