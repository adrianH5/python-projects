Bladder carcinoma (BCa) is a prevalent urological malignancy characterised by high recurrence and progression rates, posing significant challenges in clinical management.
The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has emerged as a promising prognostic marker for metabolic health in various cancers.
This study explores the prognostic value of the TyG index in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with a focus on its association with high-grade recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and the mediating role of systemic inflammation.
