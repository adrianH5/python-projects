Radiation exposure to the heart in women with left-sided breast cancer can lead to cardiac disease and increased mortality.
Several techniques, including deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH), have been used to reduce cardiac exposure during radiotherapy.
DIBH coaching prior to radiation planning can further reduce cardiac doses.
This study aims to compare heart and lung dosimetric parameters between coached and non-coached patients using the DIBH technique for left-sided breast cancer treatment.
