Basic and translational research in lung cancer is a rapidly evolving field with transformational impact in early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic development and personalization of care.
Recent advances have greatly increased our understanding in the molecular genomics, proteomics, pathogenesis and cellular biology of this deadly malignancy.
The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) recently formed a Basic and Translational Science (BaTS) Committee to further enhance the scientific leadership of IASLC in thoracic cancer research.
This review by members of the committee highlights the breadth of current research in NSCLC, with a focus on molecular risk factors and processes in tumorigenesis, heterogeneity, phenotypic plasticity, metabolic reprograming, immunobiology, the immune microenvironment and microbiome.
This review also identifies future research areas that may lead to further improvement in survival outcomes and curative therapies especially for patients with advanced NSCLC.
