The oncogene steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) plays a pivotal role in the downstream transcriptional regulation mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER), thereby promoting the occurrence and progression of endocrine resistance in breast cancer.
Herein, we disclose a novel series of potent SRC-3 PROTACs to overcome endocrine resistance.
These PROTACs were able to efficiently degrade SRC-3 and inhibit the proliferation of wild-type and endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells.
