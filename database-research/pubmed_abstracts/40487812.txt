We encountered a case of pulmonary actinomycosis diagnosed through bronchoscopy, initially suspected as lung cancer originating from the bullae, and the PET-CT findings did not rule out malignancy.
Pulmonary actinomycosis is a rare lung infection that often mimics cancer.
Its anaerobic nature and prolonged culture time make diagnosis challenging without strong clinical suspicion.
