Recent clinical trials (including JCOG0802 and GLB140503) have demonstrated favorable outcomes for sublobar resection in small lung nodules, highlighting the importance of precise anatomical segmentectomy.
However, accurate identification of intersegmental planes remains technically challenging.
We developed the AIDVB (Artery-priority, Inflation/deflation, Vein/Bronchus) procedure to improve surgical precision.
