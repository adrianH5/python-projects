Microvascular ablation during high dose-per-fraction radiotherapy (HDFRT) is disparately reported in the literature.
This study was conducted to quantify the tumour microvascular response to different HDFRT schedules.&#xD;&#xD;Approach: A high single-dose irradiation of 20 Gy and two multifraction schedules (3 fractions of 10 Gy and 15 Gy each) were studied.
Patient-derived BxPC-3 pancreatic tumours in a mouse dorsal skinfold window chamber were treated and their 3D microvascular networks were longitudinally imaged with speckle variance optical coherence tomography (svOCT) for up to 7 weeks post irradiation.
The overall vascular volume density (VVD), VVD for small vessels (diameters between 15 - 25 μm and 25 - 35 μm), and the vascular convexity index λ (a measure of vessel organization and space filling at short distances) were quantified.&#xD;&#xD;Main results: There were no significant differences in overall VVD for treated vs. control tumours at all timepoints.
Examination of small-diameter bins revealed some transient reductions in VVD15-25 μm and VVD25-35 μm compared to controls at t~3 weeks for larger dose-per-fraction regimens (3x15 Gy and 1x20 Gy); ablated vasculature regrew back to baseline values by 7 weeks.
Convexity indices for these larger-dose-per-fraction tumours were ~55% larger than unirradiated controls by the end of monitoring period; no such effects were seen in the 3x10 Gy cohort.&#xD;&#xD;Significance: The results of this study reveal the complex role of small vessels in microvascular ablation caused by HDFRT, with a dependence on the dose per fraction and total delivered dose.
After small vessel ablation, regrown vessels had more uniform and regular spacing than non-ablated vessels as quantified by λ, potentially suggesting improved tumour response if subsequent retreatments are attempted.&#xD.
