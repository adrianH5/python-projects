Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during cellular metabolism impacts normal cell functions, including signaling, hormone regulation, growth factors, ion transport, and apoptosis.
Cells regulate ROS levels by using antioxidant enzymes and nonenzymatic detoxifying agents to avoid damage.
It is important to focus on ROS and its involvement in cancer biology, particularly tumor progression and metastasis.
Focus has been given to the involvement of ROS in various signaling cascades and its effect on various transcription factors that modulate cancer metastasis and tumorigenesis.
For metastatic colonization to occur, endothelial cells must grow and migrate within pre-existing blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis.
The process benefits cancerous cells by providing them with oxygen and nutrients.
Therefore, we have summarized the work carried out in this field too.
We have further discussed how ROS triggers apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, which are examples of regulated cell death (RCD) mechanisms that can demonstrate antitumor effects when they accumulate beyond a certain point.
ROS are crucial to regulating and initiating apoptosis in cancerous cells, which affects the cell's ability to increase, survive, and respond to treatments.
We have compiled work on integrated bioinformatics analysis to understand the involvement of ROS in cancer biology.
We conclude through this review that ROS has a complex role in cancer biology, acting as promoters and tumorigenesis suppressors.
Future research will likely focus on harnessing ROS's dual nature for therapeutic benefit while minimizing its harmful effects on normal cells.
