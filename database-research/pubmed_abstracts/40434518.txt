Advancements in tumor research have highlighted the potential of epigenetic therapies as a targeted approach to cancer treatment.
However, the application of these therapies has faced challenges due to the issue of substrate availability since the discovery of epigenetic modifications.
Interestingly, metabolic changes are closely associated with epigenetic changes, and notably, certain metabolic enzymes exhibit nuclear localization within epigenetically active cellular contexts.
This suggests that nuclear localization of metabolic enzymes may provide a mechanistic foundation for addressing substrate availability issues in epigenetic regulation.
To date, there has been limited progress in synthesizing this information systematically.
In this study, we provide an overview of the interplay between metabolic enzymes and epigenetic mechanisms, highlighting their critical roles.
Subsequently, we summarize recent advances regarding the nuclear localization of metabolic enzymes, shedding light on their emerging roles in epigenetic regulation and oncogenesis.
