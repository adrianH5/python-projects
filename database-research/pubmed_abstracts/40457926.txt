The incidence of adnexal masses during pregnancy varies between 0.2% and 2%, with the majority of these tumors being benign and a 1% to 6% chance of malignancy.
Due to widespread use of ultrasound during the first trimester, it is quite common to detect incidental ovarian cysts.
Once a tumor is identified, the primary goal is to determine whether it is benign or malignant.
The ultrasound feature helps to determine that with a minimal help with the tumor markers, as it is altered due to pregnancy.
Then, the next step is to decide if surgical intervention is necessary.
If surgery is required, it is important to determine the safest time to perform it and whether to opt for laparotomy or laparoscopy.
We present two case reports of pregnancies with ovarian cysts, both diagnosed incidentally, with the timing of the operation chosen based on the cyst type, size, symptoms, and gestational age.
