Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic autoimmune vasculitis.
Thoracic radiographic findings in GPA can mimic various pulmonary diseases, potentially leading to misdiagnosis.
We describe a case of delayed GPA diagnosis, initially presenting as irregularly shaped solid lung nodules with heterogeneous enhancement, such cases are rarely reported.
