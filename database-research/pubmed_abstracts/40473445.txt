Zanidatamab, a dual human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted bispecific antibody, previously demonstrated encouraging antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with treatment-refractory HER2-expressing gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
Here, we evaluated the antitumour activity and safety of zanidatamab plus chemotherapy in first-line HER2-positive advanced gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
