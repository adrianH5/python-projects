Cancer remains a major global health issue, prompting the need for innovative treatment approaches that extend beyond conventional methods such as chemotherapy and radiation.
The endocannabinoid system (ECS), primarily the cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R, presents a promising opportunity for cancer therapy by selectively targeting cell signaling pathways.
This systematic review intends to explore the mode of action of synthetic cannabinoids as potential anticancer agents and their impact on tumor growth in various cancer cell lines.
