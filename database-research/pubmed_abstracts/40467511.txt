Objective Although marital status has been demonstrated to affect patients' decisions to undergo active treatment for pancreatic cancer (PC), the role of other household cohabitants remains uncertain.
This study aimed to examine whether the presence or absence of other household cohabitants, apart from spouses, affects the treatment decisions of patients with PC.
Methods and Patients A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with PC at the Akita University Hospital between January 2014 and December 2020 was conducted.
Information about the patients' backgrounds, including the number of persons residing in their households, was gathered.
A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to ascertain the factors associated with patients' decisions to undergo aggressive treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.
Results A total of 214 patients with histopathologically confirmed PC were enrolled in this study.
Those who lived with others were more likely to receive aggressive treatment than those who lived alone (84.9% vs. 54.5%; p<0.01).
The multivariate analysis, adjusted for patients' age, performance status, and marital status indicated that the patient's decision to undergo aggressive treatment was found to be positively associated with living with other household members with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 4.5 (1.02-19.9), p<0.05.
Conclusion Our findings indicate that the influence of cancer treatment decisions extends beyond that of spouses to encompass other household cohabitation members.
By providing comprehensive social and emotional assistance to patients residing in isolation, it is possible to facilitate active treatment and enhance the prognosis for patients with PC.
