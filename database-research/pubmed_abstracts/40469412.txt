Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disease.
Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) was the first successfully used drug in HCL; its favourable effect has been known since the early 1980s.
However, currently the first-line treatment of the disease consists of purine nucleoside analogs.
