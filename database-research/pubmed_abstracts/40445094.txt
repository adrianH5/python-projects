Purpose To determine the impact of method of detection (MOD) on breast cancer stage, treatment, and breast cancer-related mortality in patients aged 40 years or older.
Materials and Methods This retrospective observational cohort study included consecutive female individuals aged 40 years or older diagnosed with breast cancer at a tertiary referral center between January and December 2016.
Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were computed using logistic regression modeling to determine the impact of MOD (screen-detected vs symptom-detected) on pathologic stage (American Joint Commission on Cancer, eighth edition), surgical treatment, and chemotherapy, with Cox regression to find the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI for mortality.
Significance level was set at a
