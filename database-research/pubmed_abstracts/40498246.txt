The complement system bridges innate and adaptive immunity, and its role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is complex and context-dependent.
Multiple recent studies have demonstrated the complement system's pro- and anti-tumor effects.
In the present review, we discuss the role of complement in shaping the functions of various immune cells, including T cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells within the TME.
We also highlighted how complement proteins drive the pro- or anti-inflammatory immune responses, the associated cellular and molecular mechanisms, their influence on anti-tumor immunity, and some clinical trials targeting complement systems.
A comprehensive and critical understanding of the complement system in oncoimmunology may aid in designing effective tumor-specific therapeutic strategies.
