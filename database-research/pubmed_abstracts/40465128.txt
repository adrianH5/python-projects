Cisplatin is currently used as the central agent in several cancer chemotherapy protocols because of its broad antitumor spectrum and potent antitumor effects; however, preventing cisplatin-induced renal damage and other adverse events is challenging.
Recently, several clinical studies have shown that a short hydration method could prevent cisplatin-induced renal damage.
In addition, appropriate magnesium supplementation and administration of forced diuretics have been shown to be renoprotective.
The Japanese Lung Cancer Society Guidelines Committee has summarized the evidence of renal protection regarding cisplatin administration to provide optimal administration guidance for the cisplatin short hydration method.
