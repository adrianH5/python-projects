Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women globally, with notable disparities in incidence between sexes, particularly in low and middle-income countries.
Understanding these disparities is essential for tackling health inequities, particularly in Indonesia, where access to screening and treatment is spatially inconsistent.
This study examined the trends and disparities in breast cancer incidence in Indonesia from 2000 to 2019, utilizing sex-disaggregated data from the World Health Organization's Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT).
