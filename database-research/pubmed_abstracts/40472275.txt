Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the rib is extremely rare.
Herein, we report a case of solitary primary rib lymphoma in a 55-year-old man.
18F-FDG PET/CT revealed a hypermetabolic lesion in the right seventh rib.
The subsequent histology and immunohistochemistry of the rib lesion confirmed the diagnosis of highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
