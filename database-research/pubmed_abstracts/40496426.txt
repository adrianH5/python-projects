The situation of correctional facilities in African countries represents a critical threat to health due to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and limited access to medical services.
With over 3000 facilities and nearly a million incarcerated individuals, the prevalence of health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, mental health disorders, and tuberculosis is alarmingly high.
These conditions are exacerbated by physical and psychological abuse and inadequate healthcare infrastructure.
Despite these challenges, the health needs of incarcerated individuals in Africa remain largely neglected.
This article provides a review of the health status of incarcerated individuals in Africa, drawing on limited available data.
Lessons from developed countries highlight the potential for effective interventions through structured healthcare programs and policies.
Recommendations include adopting the World Health Organization (WHO) prison health framework, improving judicial efficiency to reduce overcrowding, ensuring healthcare is managed by health ministries, and establishing rehabilitation centers.
These measures are crucial for integrating incarcerated individuals back into society and achieving equitable health coverage in Africa.
