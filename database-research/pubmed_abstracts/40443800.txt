The nuclear basket is a 'fishtrap'-like structure on the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex which has been implicated in diverse functions including RNA export, heterochromatin organisation, and mitosis.
Recently, a novel component of the nuclear basket, ZC3HC1, has been described.
The localisation of ZC3HC1 to nuclear pores has been reported to occur reciprocally with TPR, a major structural component of the nuclear basket.
