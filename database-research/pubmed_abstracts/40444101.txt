This article argues for incorporating a broader definition of "value" into cancer clinical trials.
Current trials primarily focus on efficacy and safety, neglecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as quality of life, financial toxicity, and time burden, as well as cost-effectiveness.
We propose a novel framework integrating oncologic outcomes, PROs, and cost analyses.
We also propose a multidimensional visual tool, such as a radar chart, to facilitate better-informed, value-based shared decision-making.
This requires a collaborative approach, involving stakeholders in defining value metrics.
While acknowledging challenges such as increased administrative burden and data interpretation complexities, a comprehensive framework can substantially improve patient-centered cancer care.
The ultimate goal is to standardize value assessment in cancer research, leading to more equitable and effective care.
