Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, although effective in treating patients with a variety of advanced malignancies, can result in potentially severe or even fatal immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
This study aimed to generate real-world evidence on irAE characteristics, clinical management and clinical outcomes among patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) malignant melanoma (a/mMM) or advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) treated with nivolumab (NIVO) and/or ipilimumab (IPI) in the UK.
