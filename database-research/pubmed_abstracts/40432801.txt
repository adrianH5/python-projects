Psychosocial distress is common in patients before and after solid organ transplantation.
Regular screening facilitates the early identification of distressed patients and the provision of appropriate professional care.
However, feasible screening tools that address the specific problems of transplant patients are missing.
Thus, the aim of this mixed methods study was to develop transplant-specific problem lists for patients before (transplant candidates) and after (transplant recipients) solid organ transplantation which can be used as a quick and easily applicable screening tool for psychosocial distress.
