Metastatic triple negative breast cancer has a poor prognosis with limited targeted treatment options.
In preclinical studies PI3K inhibition led to increased DNA damage and subsequent sensitization to PARP inhibition.
This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of an mTOR/pan-PI3K inhibitor, gedatolisib, with the PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer or advanced HER2 negative breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation.
