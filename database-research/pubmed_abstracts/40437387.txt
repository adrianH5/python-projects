Pituitary apoplexy is a clinical syndrome caused by hemorrhage or ischemia of a pituitary adenoma, typically presenting with sudden-onset headache, visual disturbances, and cranial nerve palsy.
Pituitary apoplexy is relatively rare in clinical practice and is often triggered by an imbalance between the high metabolic demands of pituitary adenomas and their blood supply.
Ischemic injury leads to pituitary cell necrosis, resulting in hypopituitarism, which can cause systemic multi-organ dysfunction and pose significant health risks.
