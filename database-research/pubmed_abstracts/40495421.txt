The blood-brain barrier (BBB) impedes the passage of most circulating drugs into the brain.
Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound with microbubbles (LIPU/MB) transiently opens the BBB, improving parenchymal drug penetration.
Parenchymal drug retention following short-lived BBB opening is unknown.
We investigated the effect of LIPU/MB on the concentration of carboplatin and fluorescein over time, and compared the parenchymal retention of temozolomide, carboplatin, and fluorescein in non-sonicated brain.
