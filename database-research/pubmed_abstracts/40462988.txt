Serine metabolism is of growing biologic and therapeutic interest in cancer.
Upregulation of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) can fuel tumor growth, and cancers with this phenotype are often sensitive to SSP inhibitors.
In parallel, dietary restriction of serine and glycine (SG) can suppress some cancers, but the determinants of sensitivity to this approach are poorly understood.
This is especially true in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where serine metabolism has been less explored.
We report that a subset of human AML cell lines and primary samples are completely dependent on external serine, known as serine auxotrophy.
These leukemias consistently suppressed the SSP enzyme PSAT1, failed to synthesize serine, responded to SG restriction
