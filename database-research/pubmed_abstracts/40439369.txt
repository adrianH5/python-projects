Altered expression of tissue-specific tumor markers is associated with clinicopathological factors and poor clinical outcomes in Gastric Cancer (GC).
However, the markers have been scarcely explored in the context of the distinct GC subtypes, which are crucial for assessing treatment response.
This study explores the nuanced differences between gastric tubular adenocarcinoma (TA) and signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), focusing on the correlation of ERK1/2, Bcl2, and Sorcin expression.
The aim is to identify potential differences between the subtypes and assess the prognostic value of the markers in relation to clinicopathological outcomes.
