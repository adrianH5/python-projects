Effective strategies to closing the knowledge gap on cervical cancer and pap screening are needed to increase screening rates and create a greater demand for services in Nigeria.
Using the PEN-3 Cultural Model, this paper facilitates understanding of cultural influences on women's decision to screen for cervical cancer.
The study draws on qualitative interviewing to explore women's experiences with pap testing and to describe how cervical cancer prevention is perceived, communicated, and utilized in the population.
Data consisted of interviews generated from a purposeful sample of 63 adult female participants.
An iterative approach was used to abductively synthesize data to identify themes.
Analyses produced three themes: knowledge and relational motivation, risk and barrier perceptions, and getting the word out.
Findings highlight the potential in applying culturally centered approaches to promoting cervical cancer prevention in underserved populations.
