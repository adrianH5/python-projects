The combination chemotherapy of alpha-PD-1/PD-L1 has become the standard treatment option for some cancer patients.
However, studies have shown that not all patients benefit from improved survival rates, especially the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy for progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with gastric or gastroesophageal cancer (GC/GEJC) remains highly controversial.
To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at comparing the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in GC/GEJC patients.
