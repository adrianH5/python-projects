Dysregulated cellular signaling pathways involving protein kinases are critically implicated in cancer development.
Consequently, protein kinases have emerged as key targets for novel anticancer therapies.
A range of kinase inhibitors, including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies, has been developed.
Although early strategies focused on achieving high specificity to minimize adverse effects, resistance to these targeted therapies has limited their effectiveness.
As a result, broader-spectrum inhibitors that act on multiple cancer-related kinases are now considered more promising therapeutic options.
