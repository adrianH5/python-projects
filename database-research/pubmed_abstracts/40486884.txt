Exosomal long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) might facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in liver cancer after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), thereby enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and migration.
This study investigated the prognostic role of plasma exosomal long noncoding RNA-plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (lncRNA-PVT1) in TACE treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
