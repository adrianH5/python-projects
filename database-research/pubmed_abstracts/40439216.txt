Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a critical innate immune protein that potentiates anticancer immunity.
An adjuvanted micelle, PC7A, directly binds to STING and coordinates robust immune signaling after local tumor delivery but is not optimized for intravenous administration.
To improve systemic delivery, we engineered a hybrid, STING-activating micelle (HySTING) composed of an immune-stimulating polymer, PEG-
