Chest malignancies such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pleural mesothelioma (PM) have an ominous prognosis.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of NSCLC and PM improves patient survival, but the precise underlying mechanism remains unknown.
Here, we hypothesized that low-dose PDT (L-PDT) alters the expression of tumor endothelial cell adhesion molecules favoring immune cell recruitment and tumor control.
We explored this hypothesis in two mouse models of NSCLC and PM.
We validated our findings in 82 PM patient samples.
