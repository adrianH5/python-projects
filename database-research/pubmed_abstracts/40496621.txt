Most cervical cancer cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), a vaccine-preventable infection.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), both high HPV vaccination coverage and cervical cancer screening rates will accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer, a threshold defined as <4 age-standardized cases per 100,000 women.
