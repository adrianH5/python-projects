Paracetamol has been used for decades to relieve mild-to-moderate pain.
Its analgesic effect is mainly attributed to its metabolite, AM404, acting on cannabinoid receptors or TRPV1 channels in central nervous system (CNS) neurons.
Here, we show that AM404 is produced by primary sensory neurons.
It inhibits sodium current in nociceptor neurons, blocking action potential (AP) generation and reducing nocifensive behavior in na√Øve and inflamed rats.
We demonstrated that this analgesic effect of AM404 is mediated by its direct inhibition of nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channels (Na
