Breast cancer treatment often involves mastectomy and postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT).
PMRT rates are increasing and can improve outcomes in node-positive cases.
Although the risks of PMRT to reconstructed breasts are known, the influence of tissue expanders (TEs) on radiation to nearby organs such as the heart and lungs remains unclear.
