Methotrexate (MTX) is an antineoplastic drug used in high doses to treat different types of cancer.
Its mechanism of action relies on the structural similarities to folic acid (FA), interfering in the metabolic pathway of FA.
Due to the narrow therapeutic window and high cytotoxicity, MTX therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory in high-dose administration schemes.
