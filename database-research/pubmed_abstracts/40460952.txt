The incidence of pancreatic diseases is increasing worldwide.
Thus, there is a need to develop novel therapeutic strategies and identify molecular targets for pancreatic diseases.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are involved in epigenetic regulation, mediate diverse physiological functions and regulate various vital activities in the pancreas.
This review examines the roles of HDACs in different pancreatic cells and the potential therapeutic value of targeting HDACs in pancreatic diseases.
Additionally, the potential of HDAC inhibitors as a combination therapy strategy for pancreatic diseases has been discussed, providing novel insights and directions for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of pancreatic diseases.
