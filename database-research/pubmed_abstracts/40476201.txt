Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is a rare inflammatory condition of the breast that can mimic inflammatory breast cancer.
We report a case of a 54-year-old female who developed recurrent GM symptoms in the context of drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, which resolved with dopamine agonist therapy.
Our report suggests that serum prolactin should be tested in patients with GM and appropriately managed if elevated.
