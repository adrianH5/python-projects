The skin, the body's largest organ, functions as both a protective shield and a complex sensory interface with the external environment.
Its structural integrity and physiological functions are influenced by various intrinsic and extrinsic aging factors, often manifesting as wrinkles, fine lines, and pigmentation changes.
Among the crucial determinants of skin health are trace elements, particularly zinc, copper, iron, selenium, manganese, and silicon, which are vital for maintaining skin homeostasis, supporting antioxidant defense, modulating inflammation, and facilitating tissue repair.
Deficiencies or imbalances in these micronutrients have been implicated in a range of dermatological conditions, including acne, eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo, alopecia areata, and skin cancers.
These elements can be replenished internally through diet and supplementation or externally via topical formulations.
However, the widespread use of cosmetics and skincare products also introduces potential risks associated with toxic trace elements, underscoring the need for regulatory oversight and the development of safe, evidence-based skincare interventions.
This narrative review explores the pivotal roles of beneficial trace elements in skin physiology and pathology, while addressing the implications of toxic metal exposure in dermatological health.
