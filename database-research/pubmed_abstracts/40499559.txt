Studies from our lab demonstrated that increasing miR-200 expression in human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) reduced tumor growth and metastasis In Vivo.
In this study, we found that overexpression of miR-200s in TNBC cells significantly reduced the expression of JAG1.
When JAG1 was knocked out in MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation and invasion were significantly reduced In Vitro.
Moreover, loss of JAG1 inhibited mammary tumor growth and metastasis In Vivo.
RNA sequencing revealed that loss of JAG1 altered the expression of genes associated with the ECM, angiogenesis, and EMT.
These results imply that miR-200s may mediate some of their antitumor actions through reducing JAG1 expression and suggest that agents targeting JAG1 should be further evaluated as a therapeutic strategy for TNBC.
