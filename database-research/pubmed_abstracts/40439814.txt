Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent form of lung cancer worldwide.
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding RNAs that are involved in lung cancer.
This study aimed to develop a lncRNA-based risk assessment model based on RNA methylation to evaluate the prognosis of patients with LUAD.
