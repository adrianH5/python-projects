Liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), present significant treatment challenges, with limited curative options available.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has emerged as a minimally invasive therapeutic approach for early-stage HCC, offering comparable survival benefits to surgical resections in some patients.
However, the economic implications of RFA relative to other treatment modalities remain a critical factor in decision-making.
This study systematically reviews economic evaluations of RFA to assess its viability in managing liver malignancies.
