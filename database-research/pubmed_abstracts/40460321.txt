Anthracycline and cytarabine chemotherapy has been the backbone of induction chemotherapy for AML for more than 50 years.
Advances in our understanding of leukemia biology and the development of targeted agents against leukemia driver mutations have revolutionized therapy for subsets of patients.
In addition, the development of more effective and less toxic induction regimens with a backbone of venetoclax and hypomethylating agents is a real advance in therapy for older or less fit patients with AML.
In this review, we will describe improved outcomes for alternate induction strategies, results with combinations of targeted agents and standard chemotherapy, and the important role of complete diagnostic testing and clinical trials to improve outcomes for patients with AML.
