Living with a brain tumor or caring for someone affected by one presents significant emotional, physical, and financial challenges.
Patients often contend with difficult treatment decisions and symptoms that disrupt daily life, while informal caregivers must navigate complex medical needs, cognitive and behavioral changes, and the psychological toll of supporting a loved one through a life-altering diagnosis.
This study aims to explore the content of brain tumor online discussion forums to learn more about the experiences, concerns, and coping strategies shared by brain tumor patients and their informal caregivers.
