The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and limitations of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) across different cancer types, with a focus on breast and head and neck cancers.
The aim was to compare IORT with other radiotherapy techniques and assess its benefits and drawbacks in oncological settings.
