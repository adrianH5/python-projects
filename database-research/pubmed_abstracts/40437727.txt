Lung cancer, predominantly lung adenocarcinoma, remains a major health challenge in Indonesia, with late-stage detection being common.
This study explores the use of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for assessing ALK rearrangement from smear samples, a significant shift towards less invasive diagnostic methods, by assessing its concordance with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in detecting Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
