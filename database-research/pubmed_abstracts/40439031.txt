Relevant studies have demonstrated that α-glucosidase represents a crucial target for diabetes treatment, and andrographolide (AO) exhibits notable inhibitory activity against this enzyme.
In this research, the interaction mechanism between AO and α-glucosidase was investigated using UV-Vis, fluorescence analysis, FT-IR, circular dichroism (CD), and molecular docking techniques.
AO induced static quenching of the fluorescent groups in α-glucosidase through a spontaneous reaction process (ΔG
