Carotenoids are a broad category of biologically active pigments in plants and animals with significant health associations, including immune-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant roles.
They persuade prevention of illness through numerous mechanisms such as protection against oxidative stress, encouragement of cardiovascular and neuroprotective events, and reduction of diseases comprising cancer and macular degeneration.
Carotenoids have several health benefits but are unstable, with low bioavailability, and easily degrade in environments containing light, heat, and oxygen.
Since the encapsulation improves carotenoid solubility, stability, and controlled release, it has become a feasible strategy for overcoming these issues.
This review considers a few encapsulation methods, including electrospinning, lipid-based delivery systems, spray drying, freeze drying, and supercritical fluid technology.
Each of these methods is assessed in terms of their ability to retain carotenoids, improve bioavailability, and deliver targeted distribution.
Evaluation of these methods has been made with the view of benefits, drawbacks, and suitability for industrial use.
In conclusion, the analysis identifies current challenges in carotenoid encapsulation and potential future investigation and innovation directions in this area to exploit carotenoid-based functional foods, nutraceuticals, and medications.
