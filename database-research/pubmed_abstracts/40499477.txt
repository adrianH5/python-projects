Although previous studies have shown that galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and proprioceptive stimulation (PS) can improve balance function in patients with post-stroke balance disorders, the exact central mechanisms remain unclear.
This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate differences and changes in cortical activation during PS, GVS, and their combination in healthy individuals and patients with post-stroke balance disorders.
