Human topoisomerase II (topoII) is a well-known and validated target for cancer treatment.
We previously reported a first set of 6-amino-tetrahydroquinazoline derivatives as novel human topoII inhibitors.
Here, we report on the expansion and this molecular scaffold and present 17 additional analogs centered on the tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine heterocycle.
Some of these compounds exhibit promising topoII inhibitory and antiproliferative activities.
Compound 24 (ARN21929) shows good in vitro potency, with an IC
