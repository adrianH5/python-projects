Choriocarcinoma (CC), a rare and aggressive form of cancer, is composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts.
It is present in two subtypes: gestational choriocarcinoma (GCC) and non-gestational choriocarcinoma (NGCC).
Recognizing the disparities between GCC and NGCC is essential for the precise staging, prognosis, and determination of the primary treatment strategy.
