In the European Union (EU), the orphan legislation, aiming to increase the number of pharmacotherapies available for rare diseases, came into force in April 2000.
This study examined the development of the selection of orphan medicines granted marketing authorisation, their approved indications, and the number of orphan medicines developed for paediatric use in EU during 2000-2022.
This study also examined the availability of the orphan medicines with a marketing authorisation in the Finnish market in order to demonstrate their country level uptake in a single member state.
