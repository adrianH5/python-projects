Malignant melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer, and its global incidence has increased in the last decades.
Recent studies have shown that propolis has an antitumor effect against various types of cancers.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Qazvin propolis nanoparticles encapsulated in liposomes on the A375 and HDF cell lines.
For this purpose, the thin film hydration method was used to encapsulate nanopropolis within the liposomal formulation.
Then, the physicochemical properties of the prepared liposomes were determined using DLS, FTIR, and SEM.
In addition, the effects of this formulation on cell apoptosis, cell adhesion, cancer cell migration, and
