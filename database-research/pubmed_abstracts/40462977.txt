Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs), a family of G-protein coupled receptors, are emerging as potential therapeutic targets in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Phendione, a known T2R5 agonist, has not been previously investigated in HNSCC.
Here, we show that phendione activates endogenously expressed T2R5 in HNSCC cells and
