Dysregulation retrograde axonal transport in neurons results in autophagosome accumulation, enhancing amyloid β (Aβ) production and accelerating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression.
Ras-associated GTP-binding protein 7 (Rab7) is pivotal in autophagosome maturation and their fusion with lysosomes, as well as in bidirectional axonal transport through interactions with partner proteins.
Recent studies suggest that adapter-associated protein complex 2 subunit α1 (AP2A1) modulates retrograde axonal autophagosomes transport, regulates autophagy, and influences AD progression.
However, the interplay between AP2A1 and Rab7, along with the molecular mechanisms underlying their impact on neuronal autophagy in AD, remains poorly understood.
