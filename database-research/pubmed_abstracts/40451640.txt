Barrett's esophagus screening is critical for early detection of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but optimal strategies remain debated.
This systematic review analyzed thirteen studies evaluating screening cost-effectiveness through September 2024.
Both traditional endoscopic and emerging non-endoscopic methods were cost-effective compared to no screening, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below standard willingness-to-pay thresholds.
Non-endoscopic approaches, particularly swallowed cell collection devices with biomarkers, demonstrated superior cost-effectiveness versus standard endoscopy.
Cost-effectiveness improved in populations with higher disease prevalence.
Current evidence supports implementing screening programs, especially using non-endoscopic methods in high-risk populations.
Future research should focus on validating risk stratification tools to further optimize screening approaches.
