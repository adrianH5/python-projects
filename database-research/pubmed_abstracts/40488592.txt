Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) Americans bear a high burden of cancer and all-cause mortality.
Previous studies show that foreign-born individuals in the United States generally have lower cancer mortality rates, although it is more pronounced among NHBs.
This study examined differences in cancer and all-cause mortality risk between U.S.-born and foreign-born NHB adults and by the duration of U.S. residence among foreign-born.
