Approximately 10% of cases with gastric cancer (GC) exhibit familial clustering, however, only 1-3% of cases can be explained by two known hereditary syndromes: Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) caused by CDH1 and CTNNA1 pathogenic germline variants; and Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS), caused by germline variants in APC 1B promoter.
Familial intestinal gastric cancer (FIGC) has been defined clinically, but it remains mostly genetically unexplained.
Likewise, the heritability of mixed histology GC remains to be known.
We aimed to estimate the frequency of known cancer predisposition gene variants in GC cases with and without a cancer family history, diverse histological subtypes, and varied age of onset.
