The ecosystem and human health are seriously at risk from contamination of heavy metals in water.
A variety of pollution indices are used in this study to analyze the presence of heavy metal contamination in groundwater and used Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the health hazards associated with it.
In two seasons the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater samples were taken in triplicate from 25 sites in South Kashmir, which is situated in the southern portion of the northwest Himalayas.
The research area had higher than average quantities of heavy metals, according to the results.
The cold climate probably had no seasonal influence on groundwater quality, but concentrations were generally greater in pre-monsoon than in the post-monsoon.
To evaluate contamination, the study employed the following pollution indices: NPI (80%), HEI (76%), MI (80%), CoD (76%), and HPI (0%).
There were found to be strong correlations between these indices, with R
