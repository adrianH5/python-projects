Circulating tumor cell (CTC) clusters are often detected in blood samples of patients with high-grade tumor and are associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis.
However, the underlying mechanisms by which cancer cell clusters are released from primary tumors beyond blood vessel barriers remain unclear.
In this study, a three-dimensional (3D)
