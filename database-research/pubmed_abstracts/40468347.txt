Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, significantly impacting reproductive health.
Obesity, prevalent in 50-80% of PCOS patients, exacerbates metabolic disturbances and negatively influences assisted reproductive technology outcomes.
This study investigates how obesity alters the proteomic profile of follicular fluid-derived small extracellular vesicles (FF-sEVs), aiming to elucidate mechanisms underlying reproductive impairments in this population.
