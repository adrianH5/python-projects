NDC80, a crucial component of the kinetochore, plays a pivotal role in regulating cell mitosis.
Recent studies reported that NDC80 regulates the proliferation of cancer cells and may be related to poor prognosis in cancer.
However, the biological function and mechanism of NDC80 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have not yet been elucidated.
In this study, we analyzed the expression and mutation of NDC80 in ESCC tissue and assessed its impact on ESCC cells in vitro.
