Male genital lichen sclerosus (MGLSc) is a chronic inflammatory disease causing scarring and significant morbidity, and predisposing individuals to differentiated penile intraepithelial neoplasia (dPeIN) and penile squamous cell carcinoma (PeSCC).
Penile carcinogenesis follows two pathways: HPV-related and non-HPV-related.
While HPV drives undifferentiated PeIN and warty/basaloid PeSCC, MGLSc is implicated in non-HPV-related dPeIN and "usual" PeSCC.
Wnt signalling, pivotal in carcinogenesis, remains underexplored in MGLSc and PeIN.
