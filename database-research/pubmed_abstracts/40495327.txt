Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common solid tumor in men, and its incidence is strongly dependent on age.
With the aging global population, this poses a significant medical and sociodemographic issue.
As treatment options for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) expand, the proportion of elderly patients with CRPC is expected to increase.
Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) testing is becoming increasingly utilized for PCa; however, evidence on age-related outcomes or benefits is limited.
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CGP testing in advanced elderly patients with CRPC compared to younger patients.
