Hepatocellular carcinoma is the main primary liver cancer.
Due to the high recurrence rate and potential resistance to treatments, there is an urgent need to find more effective and targeted therapies.
Combinational therapies and using advanced drug delivery methods are promising approaches.
Niosomes are one of the popular types of nanoparticles in modern drug delivery systems and have recently attracted more attention.
They are biodegradable, nonimmunogenic, and more stable carriers than liposomes.
They can release anticancer drugs in an efficient and controlled manner.
The aim of this study was to synthesize and characterize the physicochemical properties of linoleic acid (LA)-loaded niosomes and evaluate their anticancer effects on a hepatoma cell.
We synthesized LA-loaded niosomes using a thin-film hydration method and characterized their size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential.
The morphology of niosomes was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy.
Finally, the viability, migration capacity, and colonization potential of Hep-3B hepatoma cells treated with 150 μM LA-loaded niosomes were investigated and compared to the control groups.
The niosomes had a mean size of 266.9 nm, PDI of 0.271, and zeta potential of -26.1 mV.
The LA-loaded niosomes released LA sustainably at 37 °C for 72 h. MTS assay indicated that the LA-loaded niosomes were more toxic than free LA.
Hep-3B hepatoma cells treated with LA-loaded niosomes showed a remarkable decline in the migration ability and colony-formation capacity.
Therefore, the use of LA-loaded niosomes in combination with conventional protocols may be a promising approach to target cancer cells.
