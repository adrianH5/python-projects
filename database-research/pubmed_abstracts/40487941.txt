N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, one of the most prevalent RNA epigenetic modifications in eukaryotes, constitutes over 60% of all RNA methylation modifications.
This dynamic modification regulates RNA processing, maturation, nucleocytoplasmic transport, translation efficiency, phase separation, and stability, thereby linking its dysregulation to diverse physiological and pathological processes.
