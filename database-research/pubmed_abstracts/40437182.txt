Necrosis is uncontrolled cell death that marks the irreversible threshold of biological degeneration.
Rooted in the Greek nekros (death), it is a pivotal mechanism underlying numerous diseases, including cancer, as well as renal, cardiac, neuronal, and hepatic disorders, and more broadly, the aging process.
Despite its profound impact on morbidity and mortality, necrosis remains untreatable and has long been viewed as a chaotic, unavoidable aspect of biology.
This review examines the mechanisms of necrosis and outlines its far-reaching impact on health, as revealed by emerging evidence.
Furthermore, we explore its potential as a game-changing therapeutic target.
Inhibiting necrosis could revolutionize treatments for acute and chronic age-related conditions like cancer, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease (including heart attacks and strokes), and neurodegeneration, while also preserving resilience-and even slowing aging itself.
Beyond Earth, where microgravity, cosmic radiation, and oxidative stress accelerate cellular decline, targeting necrosis may also hold the key to preserving astronaut resilience and health on long-duration space missions, offering insights that could reshape human longevity both on and off the planet.
