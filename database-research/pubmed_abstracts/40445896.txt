Lung cancer imaging plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment, where machine learning and deep learning have significantly advanced the accuracy and efficiency of disease classification.
This study introduces the Explainable and Lightweight Lung Cancer Net (XLLC-Net), a streamlined convolutional neural network designed for classifying lung cancer from histopathological images.
Using the LC25000 dataset, which includes three lung cancer classes and two colon cancer classes, we focused solely on the three lung cancer classes for this study.
XLLC-Net effectively discerns complex disease patterns within these classes.
The model consists of four convolutional layers and contains merely 3 million parameters, considerably reducing its computational footprint compared to existing deep learning models.
This compact architecture facilitates efficient training, completing each epoch in just 60 seconds.
Remarkably, XLLC-Net achieves a classification accuracy of 99.62% [Formula: see text] 0.16%, with precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.33% [Formula: see text] 0.30%, 99.67% [Formula: see text] 0.30%, and 99.70% [Formula: see text] 0.30%, respectively.
Furthermore, the integration of Explainable AI techniques, such as Saliency Map and GRAD-CAM, enhances the interpretability of the model, offering clear visual insights into its decision-making process.
Our results underscore the potential of lightweight DL models in medical imaging, providing high accuracy and rapid training while ensuring model transparency and reliability.
