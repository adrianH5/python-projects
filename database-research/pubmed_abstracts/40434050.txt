Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely infiltrative brain cancer that is impossible to fully remove surgically and almost always recurs at the borders of the resection cavity.
There is increasing focus on inducing cancer cell death using magneto-mechanical therapy (MMT), which involves energy conversion of an external low-frequency magnetic field into mechanical forces using magnetic nanoparticles.
Here, we combined MMT with enhanced radiotherapy (RT)─the standard of care treatment for GBM─to increase the efficiency of treatment using gold-iron nanowires (AuFe NWs).
The magnetic iron component of the nanowires mechanically rotates, inducing cellular damage, and the gold scatters X-rays due to its high atomic number, enhancing the local RT dose.
We show that reproducible synthesis of AuFe NWs with different ratios of gold:iron can be achieved using a hard-template electrochemical method, controlling composition by tuning the deposition current.
Ratios with best-performing iron percentages were selected for computational modeling to predict which frequency should be applied
