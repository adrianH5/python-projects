Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is conventionally treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy.
Multiple studies have demonstrated clinical utility of interstitial brachytherapy (BT) alone or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with BT boost for T1-T2N0 cancers of lip and buccal mucosa.
In case of combined EBRT and BT, dose summation and optimizing doses received by planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) remains challenging.The aim of this study was to generate and evaluate dosimetric parameters of PTV and OARs as a sum of high-dose-rate (HDR)-BT boost and EBRT in early T1-T2N0 cancers of lip and buccal mucosa, using deformable image registration (DIR) software (Velocity
