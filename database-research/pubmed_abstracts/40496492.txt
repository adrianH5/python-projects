Contextual integration of multiomic datasets from the same patient could improve the accuracy of subtype prediction algorithms to help with better prognosis and management of breast cancer.
Previous machine learning models have underexplored the graph-based integration, hence unable to leverage the biological associations among different omics modalities.
Here, we developed a graph-based method, GAIN-BRCA, using the native features from mRNA, DNA methylation (CpG), and miRNA data as well as the synthesized features from their interactions.
GAIN-BRCA computes weightage from miRNA-mRNA and CpG-mRNA interactions to derive a new transformed feature vector that captures the essential biological context.
