Over the last ten years, China has made significant breakthroughs in the construction of a standardized diagnosis and treatment system and technological innovation in thyroid tumor cytology.
In terms of diagnostic techniques, a standardized process combining manual smears and liquid-based cytology has been established.
The combination of hematoxylin-eosin staining and cell block technology has significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, while immunocytochemical staining plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of difficult cases.
The molecular pathology detection system has achieved leapfrog development, evolving from single-gene BRAF detection to a multi-gene panel covering BRAF, TERT and RAS genes.
The application of next-generation sequencing and other new technologies has significantly improved preoperative diagnostic efficacy.
The publication of the "Expert consensus on the cytopathological diagnosis of thyroid-fine needle aspiration (version 2023)" has further promoted the standardization of thyroid cytology diagnosis in China.
Meanwhile, Chinese scholars have made breakthroughs in the field of medical artificial intelligence.
