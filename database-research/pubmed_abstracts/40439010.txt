Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a leading cause of mortality after major liver resection.
Accurate preoperative risk assessment is essential, yet current methods have limitations.
Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB MRI) enables both morphological and functional evaluation of the liver.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the hepatic uptake index (HUI) obtained from routine preoperative Gd-EOB MRI for identifying patients at risk of severe PHLF.
