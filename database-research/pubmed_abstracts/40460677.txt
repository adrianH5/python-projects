We report the BRAF p.V600E (BRAF V600E) mutations, high tumor mutational burden (TMB-H), and RET fusions frequency/outcomes with genomically matched therapies (GMTs).
To raise awareness about GMTs providing data from a real-world scenario, the KISMET project was created.
In this article we report the characteristics and the outcomes of patients with advanced cancer harboring three different classes of molecular alterations: BRAF V600E mutations, TMB-H, and RET fusions.
