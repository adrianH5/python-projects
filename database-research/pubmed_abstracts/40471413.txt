The rate of missing data on patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in brain tumor clinical trials is particularly high over time.
One solution to this issue is the use of proxy (i.e.
partner, relative, informal caregiver) ratings in lieu of patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
In this study, we investigated patient-proxy agreement on HRQOL outcomes in high-grade glioma (HGG) patients.
