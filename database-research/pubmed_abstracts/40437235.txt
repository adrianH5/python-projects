Formation of cytoplasmic inclusions (CIs) of TDP-43 and FUS, along with DNA damage accumulation, is a hallmark of affected motor neurons in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).
However, the impact of CIs on DNA damage response (DDR) and repair in this pathology remains unprobed.
Here, we show that CIs of TDP-43 and FUS
