TAK-981 is a highly effective and selective inhibitor of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) activating enzyme, and it promotes the expression of type I interferons (IFN-Is).
Developing a sensitive bioanalytical assay for quantitating TAK-981 is essential in the clinical investigations for oncology drug development.
