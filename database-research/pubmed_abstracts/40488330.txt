Pro-inflammatory photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds immense potential to ignite robust and long-lasting systemic anti-tumor immune responses.
However, the limited penetration depth of conventional ultra violet (UV)-visible irradiation and the tumor hypoxia microenvironment significantly constrain the efficacy of immune-regulatory PDT.
Here, a mitochondria-targeting enhanced nanoplatform (NZ
