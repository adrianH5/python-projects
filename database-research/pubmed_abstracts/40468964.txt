Anticancer chemotherapy is an underappreciated contributor to cancer cachexia, an often-irreversible body-wasting condition that causes 20%-30% of cancer-related deaths.
An obstacle to predicting, monitoring and understanding the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy cachexia is that each cancer (and subtype) is assigned different chemotherapeutic compounds, typically in multiagent regimens.
Here, we investigate the chemotherapy induction regimen (CIR) used in the haematological cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
We hypothesised that the AML CIR would induce cachexia, including loss of lean tissue mass and skeletal muscle atrophy.
