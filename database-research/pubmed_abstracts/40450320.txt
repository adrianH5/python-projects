Regulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway is a major host homeostatic mechanism for controlling hyper-inflammation or chronic inflammation.
Despite extensive research, the regulatory factors of NF-kB signaling required to preserve homeostasis and control inflammatory disorders are not fully understood.
Moreover, the role of MARCH2 in chronic inflammation models and the regulation of MARCH2 activation remain to be elucidated.
