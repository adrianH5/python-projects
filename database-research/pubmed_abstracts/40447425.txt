The Canadian Real-world Evidence for Value in Cancer (CanREValue) Collaboration was established in response to growing interest in using real-world evidence (RWE) to support health technology assessment (HTA).
CanREValue has developed a framework to generate and use RWE to inform cancer drug funding decisions.
