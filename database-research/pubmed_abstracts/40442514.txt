Lumbar spondylolisthesis (LS) defined as the displacement of a vertebral body relative to the vertebra below it.
Moreover, it typically affects the lower lumbar spine, particularly in women above 50 years of age.
Many studies showed that the prevalence of LS increases with age and reported a higher number of cases in women.
This study aimed to determine the prevalence of lumbar spondylolisthesis in adults and elderly people in the Jordanian community.
