Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) provides in vivo images with cellular resolution for melanocytic lesions.
To date, no descriptions have associated cellular discohesion forming clefts ('clefting') with malignancy in melanocytic lesions using in vivo imaging techniques such as reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) or LC-OCT.
