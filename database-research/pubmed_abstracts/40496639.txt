Effective postoperative pain management following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy is essential to optimize recovery and minimize opioid consumption.
This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided continuous serratus anterior plane block (SAPB), intercostal nerve block (INB), and their combination (SAPB + INB) in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy.
