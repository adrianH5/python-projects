Durvalumab (D; anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)) monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab (T; anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)) have demonstrated efficacy in advanced cancers.
However, higher incidences of adverse events (AEs) and immune-mediated AEs (imAEs) were observed with D+T compared with D monotherapy in clinical trials.
While safety data have been published from individual clinical trials of D with or without T, we report a comprehensive safety analysis of D and D+T in a broad population and across multiple tumor types.
