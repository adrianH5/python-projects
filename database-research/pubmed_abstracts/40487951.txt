Esophageal cancer (EC), a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract, requires early diagnosis and timely treatment to improve patient prognosis.
Automated detection of EC using medical imaging has the potential to increase screening efficiency and diagnostic accuracy, thereby significantly improving long-term survival rates and the quality of life of patients.
Recent advances in deep learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks, have demonstrated remarkable performance in medical imaging analysis.
These techniques have shown significant progress in the automated identification of malignant tumors, quantitative analysis of lesions, and improvement in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
This article comprehensively examines the research progress of DL in medical imaging for EC, covering various imaging modalities such as digital pathology, endoscopy, computed tomography,
