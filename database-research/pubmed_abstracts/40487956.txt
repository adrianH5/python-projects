Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally, with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) influencing prognosis and immunotherapy response.
Current TIME evaluation relies on invasive biopsies, limiting its clinical application.
This study hypothesized that computed tomography (CT)-based deep learning (DL) radiomics models can non-invasively predict key TIME biomarkers: Tumor-stroma ratio (TSR), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and immune score (IS).
