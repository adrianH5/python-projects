The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in treating hematologic malignancies has generated widespread interest in translating this technology to solid cancers.
However, issues like tumor infiltration, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and tumor heterogeneity limit its efficacy in the solid tumor setting.
Recent experimental and clinical studies propose local administration directly into the tumor or at the tumor site to increase CAR T-cell infiltration and improve treatment outcomes.
Characteristics of the types of solid tumors that may be the most receptive to this treatment approach remain unclear.
In this work, we develop a simplified spatiotemporal model for CAR T-cell treatment of solid tumors, and use numerical simulations to compare the effect of introducing CAR T cells via intratumoral injection versus intracavitary administration in diverse cancer types.
We demonstrate that the model can reproduce tumor and CAR T-cell data from small imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models.
Our results suggest that locally administered CAR T cells will be most successful against slowly proliferating, highly diffusive tumors.
In our simulations, assuming equal detectable tumor diameters at the time of treatment, low average tumor cell density is a better predictor of treatment success than total tumor burden or volume doubling time.
These findings affirm the clinical observation that CAR T cells will not perform equally across different types of solid tumors, and suggest that measuring tumor density may be helpful when considering the feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy and planning dosages for a particular patient.
We additionally find that local delivery of CAR T cells can result in deep tumor responses, provided that the initial CAR T-cell dose does not contain a significant fraction of exhausted cells.
