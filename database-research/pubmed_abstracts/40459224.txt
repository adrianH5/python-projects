Social media plays a significant role in career exploration and professional networking, yet its use by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) genetic counseling students remains underexplored.
This study examines the use of social media by BIPOC genetic counseling students and its potential to increase diversity in the profession.
As part of a longitudinal study using a constructivist grounded theory approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 current BIPOC genetic counseling students.
Through reflexive thematic analysis, themes were conceptualized; these revealed a desire, as prospective students, for more social media content made by BIPOC genetic counseling students and increased awareness of existing resources.
Barriers to posting genetic counseling-related content as current students included time constraints, perceived lack of credibility, and concerns about damaging professional identity.
Despite these barriers, some participants expressed a desire to post more actively after graduation, particularly about advocacy related to the field.
The findings highlight a noteworthy reliance by prospective genetic counseling students on social media for information, contrasting with a low supply of content from current students and professionals.
To address this gap, we suggest implementing training and mentoring practices focused on social media use, promoting paid opportunities for BIPOC students to create content, and encouraging open discussion about social media engagement within training programs.
By fostering a supportive environment and highlighting successful examples of social media use from current genetic counselors, BIPOC students may feel more empowered to share their experiences and insights, enhancing awareness of genetic counseling as a career option for BIPOC individuals.
This study underscores the importance of addressing barriers to social media engagement among BIPOC genetic counseling students to promote a more diverse and inclusive profession.
