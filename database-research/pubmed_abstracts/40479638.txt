Genome-wide association studies have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in European and Asian populations, but studies in admixed populations, like Brazilians, remain scarce.
We aimed to replicate 45 SNPs associated with CRC risk and explore their correlation with genetic ancestry in a large Brazilian cohort.
