A 66-year-old man presented with both small-cell lung cancer and prostate adenocarcinoma.
Staging PET with 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed increased uptake in the right pulmonary hilum, mediastinum, fifth cervical vertebra, and fifth lumbar vertebra.
In contrast, subsequent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT revealed intense uptake only in the prostate and vertebrae, which demonstrated that the bone lesions had metastasized from prostate cancer.
