Bacterial genotoxins, CDT and colibactin, cause severe DNA damage in host cells and impair the DNA-damage response, leading to genomic instability.
Some phenotypes induced by these genotoxins (actin cytoskeleton remodeling, stress fibers accumulation, disturbance of focal adhesion, cell-cell junctions' disassembly, increased ploidy and genome instability, endoreplication) are known to involve the Hippo signaling pathway, suggesting a link between some effects induced by these toxins and Hippo pathway.
