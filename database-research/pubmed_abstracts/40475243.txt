Novel fused pyran derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for anticancer activity against MCF7 (ATCC - HTB-22, breast), A549 (ATCC - CCL-185, lung), and HCT116 (ATCC - CCL-247, colorectal) cancer cell lines.
Most compounds exhibited broad-spectrum activity.
Among them, imidazole-containing derivatives 8a and 8b demonstrated potent anti-breast cancer activity with IC
