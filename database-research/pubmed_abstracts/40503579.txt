Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men in the European Union, the USA and Israel, with heritability being a key risk factor.
Endogamy and kinship are known to increase the likelihood of transmitting genetic mutations associated with various cancers, as seen in populations with high levels of consanguinity, such as Ashkenazi Jews.
The Ashkenazi Jewish population, with a history of genetic bottlenecks and selective migrations, has a higher prevalence of inherited mutations that predispose individuals to various diseases including cancer.
This article reviews the literature examining the potential effects of founder mutations specific to Ashkenazi Jews, in enhancing the genetic risk of prostate cancer in this population.
