Postoperative hyperglycemia is common in gastric cancer (GC) patients, especially during enteral and parenteral nutrition.
While the importance of postoperative glycemic control in diabetic patients is well-recognized, the management of blood glucose (BG) in non-diabetic patients after surgery has received less attention.
This study aimed to investigate the impact of postoperative BG levels on overall survival (OS) in non-diabetic GC patients.
Additionally, we explored whether postoperative BG mediates the relationship between body composition parameters and postoperative survival, and to what extent this mediation occurs.
