The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is high among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients following Platinum-based concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT).
However, the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on the risk of AKI in HNC patients undergoing CCRT is controversial.
This study aimed to investigate the association between RAAS blockade, AKI and survival in HNC patients undergoing CCRT.
