Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to immunosuppression in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), leading to high aggressiveness and poor prognosis.
However, the key molecules involved in shaping TAMs toward the pro-tumoral phenotype in CRLM remain unclear, limiting the development of macrophage-mediated immunotherapies for CRLM.
