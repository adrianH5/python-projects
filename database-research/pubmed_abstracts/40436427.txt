In England, Child Death Review (CDR) is a statutory process designed to identify full reasons for death, support parents, improve care and save lives.
At CDR meetings, professionals review care and identify learning.
Although parents do not attend CDR meetings, they should be invited to contribute questions and feedback and be informed of outcomes.
There is a lack of evidence to support implementation, particularly for families after an expected child death.
