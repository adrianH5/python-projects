Tumor regression grade (TRG) is evaluated by calculating the proportion of residual tumor to stromal fibrosis, which can reflect the tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).
Overall, patients with TRG1 show good sensitivity to NCRT but the long-term survival for these patients remains different.
This study aimed to assess the prognostic factors in patients with TRG1.
