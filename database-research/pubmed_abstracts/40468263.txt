Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal proliferative disorder of plasma cells with limited curative options.
Hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses have been implicated in the development of various hematological malignancies, but their association with MM remains unclear.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the risk of MM in individuals with HBV and HCV infections.
