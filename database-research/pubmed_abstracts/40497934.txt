Obesity is a growing global health concern, contributing to diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions.
Adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by abnormal adipokine secretion and chronic inflammation, plays a key role in these conditions.
Adipose-derived extracellular vesicles (ADEVs) have emerged as critical mediators in obesity-related diseases.
However, the study of mature adipocyte-derived EVs (mAdipo-EVs) is limited due to the short lifespan of mature adipocytes in culture, low EV yields, and the low abundance of these EV subpopulations in the circulation.
Additionally, most studies rely on rodent models, which have differences in adipose tissue biology compared to humans.
To overcome these challenges, we developed a standardized approach for differentiating human preadipocytes (preAdipos) into mature differentiated adipocytes (difAdipos), which produce high-yield, human adipocyte EVs (Adipo-EVs).
Using visceral adipose tissue from bariatric surgical patients, we isolated the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and differentiated preAdipos into difAdipos.
Brightfield microscopy revealed that difAdipos exhibited morphological characteristics comparable to mature adipocytes (mAdipos) directly isolated from visceral adipose tissue, confirming their structural similarity.
Additionally, qPCR analysis demonstrated decreased preadipocyte markers and increased mature adipocyte markers, further validating successful differentiation.
Functionally, difAdipos exhibited lipolytic activity comparable to mAdipos, supporting their functional resemblance to native adipocytes.
We then isolated preAdipo-EVs and difAdipo-EVs using tangential flow filtration and characterized them using bulk and single EV analysis.
DifAdipo-EVs displayed classical EV and adipocyte-specific markers, with significant differences in biomarker expression compared to preAdipo-EVs.
These findings demonstrate that difAdipos serve as a reliable surrogate for mature adipocytes, offering a consistent and scalable source of adipocyte-derived EVs for studying obesity and its associated disorders.
