Treatment delay in breast cancer care represents a significant concern in oncology, potentially impacting patient survival outcomes.
While various factors can contribute to delayed treatment initiation, the quantitative relationship between specific delay intervals and survival remains incompletely understood in breast cancer management.
Our study aims to explore the impact of treatment delays on survival outcomes in breast cancer.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, covering publications from 2000 to 2025.
From an initial 6222 records, 18 eligible studies comprising 25 cohorts were included.
Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality were extracted or calculated for treatment delays of 4, 8, and 12Â weeks.
Random-effects meta-analyses were performed, and heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using I
