The protein and nanoparticle interaction is the basis of nanoparticle bio-reactivity.
Nanoparticles upon interaction with proteins form a protein corona, altering their characteristics.
This corona influences nanoparticles' biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy.
The complex protein-nanoparticle interactions have a significant impact on the emergence of chronic inflammation and chronic diseases.
This study is a comprehensive review that explores the dynamic nature of protein-nanoparticle interactions, emphasizing their long-term effects on sustained inflammatory responses and subsequent implications for various chronic conditions, and not an exhaustive review of all aspects.
This study investigates the role of nanoparticle characteristics such as the size, shape, and surface charge in the formation of a protein corona, addressing the molecular aspects and cellular pathways involved.
The connection between protein-nanoparticle interactions and chronic inflammation is deeply explored in the context of specific diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, neurological conditions, respiratory ailments, metabolic disorders, autoimmune conditions, and cancer.
