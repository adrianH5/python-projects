Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in men.
Over the past decades, the incidence has risen in all age groups.
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based theranostics, which involve the use of PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals for both diagnostic imaging and therapeutic applications, have become integral in the management of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
The field has witnessed a substantial and continuously expanding body of scientific literature, encompassing case reports, original research, systematic reviews and also clinical guidelines.
The objective of this joint statement is to enhance awareness of PSMA theranostics and underscore their critical role in contemporary precision oncology.
We aim to provide a comprehensive yet practical perspective on the current landscape of PSMA-based diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, offering a consensus-driven approach to their clinical application.
