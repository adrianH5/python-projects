Black men in the US are 1.8 and 2.2 times more likely to develop and die from prostate cancer (PCa) than non-Hispanic White men, respectively, and have the highest incidence globally.
Furthermore, Black men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for PCa face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to men of other racial groups.
Therefore, we have designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the impact of exercise on CVD risk factors among Black man undergoing ADT.
