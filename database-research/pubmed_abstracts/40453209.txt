High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is seen as an effective therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, it is extremely toxic.
Monitoring the plasma concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) and its important metabolite, 7-hydroxy-methotrexate (7-OH-MTX), on a routine basis aids in dose modification of rescue medications and in avoiding toxicity.
The pharmacologically active and toxic effects of drugs are due to the unbound portion, as most drugs are bound to plasma proteins to some degree.
However, the simultaneous measurement of unbound plasma concentrations of MTX and 7-OH-MTX has not been reported.
