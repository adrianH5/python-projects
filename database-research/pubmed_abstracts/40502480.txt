Right upper lobe resection is a common surgical procedure in patients diagnosed with lung cancer.
However, in certain cases, there may be an anatomical variation in which the fissure between the right middle and right lower lobes is more prominently developed than usual.
This atypical development can create a predisposition to torsion of the right middle lobe, a complication that may occur during or shortly after the surgical procedure, especially if pneumopexy or surgical fixation of the lung is not performed.
Torsion is a rare but serious complication that can lead to significant postoperative morbidity if not promptly recognized and treated.
In this case report, we provide a detailed illustration of the radiologic findings associated with right middle lobe torsion that manifested following right upper lobectomy to excise a hamartoma located in the proximal bronchus of the right upper lobe.
