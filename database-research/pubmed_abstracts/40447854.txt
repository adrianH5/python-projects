Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) is the second largest malignant tumor in the bile duct, only after primary liver cancer.
Their high invasiveness can lead to poor prognosis.
Over the past decade, research on CHOL has been ongoing, but there have been no breakthrough advancements.
According to the literature, NCAPG2 is associated with the progression of various tumors, but its relevant role and value in CHOL have not been extensively studied.
