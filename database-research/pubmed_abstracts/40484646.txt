Tumor resistance is the primary reason for treatment failure in patients with cancer, while oncolytic viruses (OVs), as a novel therapy, have been rapidly advancing through clinical evaluation and are typically assessed in recurrent tumors that are refractory to standard chemotherapy.
However, whether the adaptive process that fosters chemotherapy resistance influences the efficacy of OV therapy is unknown.
