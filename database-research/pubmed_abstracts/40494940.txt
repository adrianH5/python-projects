Physical activity (PA) has been consistently associated with improved cancer outcomes across multiple epidemiological studies.
While the evidence for clinical benefits is strong, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.
Recent technological advances now enable both continuous monitoring of PA through wearable devices and comprehensive molecular profiling through multi-omics approaches, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based molecular residual disease (MRD) detection.
This review examines current evidence regarding PA's effects on cancer biology and introduces the LIFELOG study, which aims to address critical knowledge gaps in this field.
