Despite advances in treatment for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), overall survival (OS) remains poor.
The effects of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and heart radiation doses on OS in LA-NSCLC patients, especially their combined impact, have not been thoroughly investigated.
This study aimed to examine the individual and combined effects of CAC and heart dose on OS in LA-NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy over a 3-year follow-up period.
