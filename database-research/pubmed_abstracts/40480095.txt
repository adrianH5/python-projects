Proton-induced cell death is primarily driven by the induction and repair of DNA double strand breaks.
While DNA damage dynamics have been extensively studied, the early cellular responses to proton irradiation remain underexplored.
To address this, we developed a novel live-cell microscopy platform that enables real-time visualization of cellular responses to DNA damage induced by proton therapy.
