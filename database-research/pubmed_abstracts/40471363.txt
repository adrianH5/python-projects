Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) continues to be the most significant factor-determining outcome after hepatic resection, accounting for nearly half of postoperative mortality.
In this study, we evaluated whether a newly developed commercially available test measuring circulating microRNAs (miRs) could predict PHLF and compared it with other established liver function tests.
