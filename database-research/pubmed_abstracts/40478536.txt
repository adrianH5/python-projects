Most mortality studies among Norwegian military veterans from international peacekeeping missions were conducted among men, as the number of women participants in each mission has been too small to give statistically robust results.
However, women have served in every peacekeeping operation since 1978.
As the number of military women increases, knowledge about the causes of death among female military peacekeepers is increasingly important to ensure the Armed Forces' military operability and preventive initiatives.
Hence, we aimed to study mortality in a cohort comprising all military women who participated in such service back to 1978.
