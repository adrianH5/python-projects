The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in cancer progression, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constituting the core cell population of the tumor immune microenvironment.
TAMs can differentiate into M1 or M2 types based on the TME, either inhibiting or promoting tumor development.
Ganoderma lucidum, a medicinal and edible fungus, has a long history of use for extending lifespan and improving health.
Ganoderic acid A (GAA), a bioactive compound extracted from G. lucidum, is considered the most abundant monomer among ganoderic acids and has wide applications in clinical anti-tumor therapies.
