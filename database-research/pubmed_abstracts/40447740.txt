The utility of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) among patients with various forms of autonomic dysfunction (AD) is unknown.
Twenty-four-hour ABPM among patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), AD without POTS, and control patients without AD were compared.
Patients with AD without POTS had high rates of uncontrolled blood pressure (76%), whereas 19% of patients with POTS had uncontrolled blood pressure, suggesting ABPM may provide less value among patients with POTS.
