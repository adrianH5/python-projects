Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common metabolic and endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age.
This condition is characterized by the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology, anovulation, and clinical or biochemical manifestations of hyperandrogenism.
Numerous patients diagnosed with PCOS also experience conditions such as obesity, hirsutism, insulin resistance, and an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, endometrial cancer, as well as infertility and complications during pregnancy.
While the precise etiology remains unidentified, it is widely acknowledged that genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS.
This review consolidates findings from various studies that investigated circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential diagnostic biomarkers for PCOS, illustrating both their promise and the challenges associated with clinical implementation.
We address the obstacles pertaining to standardization, explore the diagnostic potential of statistically significant miRNAs across multiple biofluids, including plasma, serum, follicular fluid, and blood, and present a graphical overview of overlapping miRNAs accompanied by a table summarizing key findings.
With further validation, miRNAs hold the potential not only to improve the diagnostic processes for PCOS but also to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions for the management of this disorder.
