Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the leading sources of cancer mortality worldwide.
An initial response to chemotherapy, such as Gemcitabine (GEM) alone or in combination with other chemotherapies, is often followed by emergent resistance, underscoring the urgent need for targeted therapies.
PDAC cells are highly addicted to oncogenic K-RAS mutations for their growth, progression, immunosuppression, and drug resistance, but mutant K-RAS in PDAC is still challenging to target.
A glycosylation inhibitor, Tunicamycin (TM), is a potent killer of PDAC cells.
However, the free TM is very toxic in clinical settings.
We developed a pH/Hypoxia-responsive iRGD-tagged biodegradable nano-encapsulated TM (
