Precision medicine aims to revolutionize healthcare by tailoring treatments to the unique genetic, molecular, and environmental profiles of individuals.
Among the innovative approaches in this field, allosteric modulation has emerged as a powerful strategy for therapeutic intervention.
Allosteric modulators regulate protein activity by binding to sites distinct from the active site, offering enhanced specificity, versatility, and control over biological processes.
This review explores the integration of allosteric modulation with precision medicine, highlighting its potential to address unmet medical needs in complex diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic conditions.
The study utilized databases like PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to conduct a thorough search of peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and case studies published between 2012 and 2024.
Allosteric modulators, driven by advancements in structural biology, artificial intelligence, and high-throughput screening, offer unique advantages in targeting undruggable proteins and overcoming drug resistance in personalized treatment strategies.
The article discusses challenges in allosteric drug development, including off-target effects and clinical translation, and provides a framework for overcoming these barriers.
This review highlights allosteric modulation's potential to revolutionise therapeutic strategies by enabling highly targeted, effective, and individualised treatments in next-generation healthcare.
