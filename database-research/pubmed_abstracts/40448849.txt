A nano-theranostic system is reported that integrates imaging, detection, and treatment.
The DNA assembly self-assembled by rolling circle amplification (RCA) product and four oligonucleotides are combined with MnO₂ nanosheets to construct DNA assembly@MnO₂.
One repeat unit of the DNA assembly contains an aptamer module for specific targeting, a metal ion-activated intracellular imaging module, and a DNAzyme module for gene therapy (GT).
Upon entering cancer cells, MnO₂ nanosheets are reduced to Mn
