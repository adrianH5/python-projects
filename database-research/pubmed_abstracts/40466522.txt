Colorectal cancer is a disease that poses significant physical and mental challenges for patients and their spousal caregivers.
Guided by the Neffs' self-compassion model, a couple-based self-compassion intervention program was created to help them cope with challenges.
Implementing this study was to test whether this program is feasible, acceptable, and effective in Chinese couples with colorectal cancer.
