Nonetheless, data concerning the effects of heating on the biological activities of garlic are scarce.
The study aimed to examine the effect of heating at various temperatures of garlic homogenate and blanching, baking, and steaming of garlic cloves on the antiproliferative activity against human ovarian cancer cells and antioxidant activity of garlic.
Heating of garlic homogenate (40°C-100°C for 10 min) did not decrease or even increase the content of phenolics and Total Antioxidant Activity (TAC) assayed by ABTS
