Tryptophan metabolism is involved in esophageal carcinogenesis.
However, its genetic mechanisms remain unclear.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic variants that encode tryptophan metabolism on susceptibility to esophageal cancer (EC) and elucidate the mechanisms underlying genetic variation in EC progression.
