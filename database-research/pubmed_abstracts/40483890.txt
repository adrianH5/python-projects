Hypertrophic pachymeningitis, characterized by inflammation and thickening of the dura mater in the skull or spinal cord, poses diagnostic and management challenges.
This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the condition, emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving clinical and radiological assessments.
Clinical manifestations vary based on lesion location, with cranial involvement typically causing headaches and cranial nerve issues, while spinal cases present with back pain, radicular symptoms, and spinal cord compression.
MRI emerges as the gold standard for diagnosis, offering insights into the severity of dural thickening and potential complications.
Differentiating between idiopathic and secondary pachymeningitis is fundamental, with the latter arising from various sources such as infections, immune-mediated processes, neoplasms, and more.
Management predominantly centers on inflammation control, often employing corticosteroids, and surgical intervention might be considered in severe cases.
This holistic approach, blending clinical expertise and advanced diagnostic tools, holds promise for enhancing therapeutic outcomes and refining patient care strategies in hypertrophic pachymeningitis.
