Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a significant global health concern, often progressing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in both humans and animals.
Despite substantial research efforts, effective CLD treatments remain scarce.
Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε), a serine/threonine kinase, plays a pivotal role in several critical signaling pathways, including the Wingless/Integrated (Wnt)/β-catenin, HIPPO, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, all of which contribute to liver disease progression.
