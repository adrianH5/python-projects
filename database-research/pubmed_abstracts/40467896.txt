Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer with poor prognosis.
The current first-line treatment for advanced TNBC (aTNBC) is determined by the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).
In the ATRACTIB trial-a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study-we evaluated the combination of atezolizumab, paclitaxel and bevacizumab as first-line treatment for patients with aTNBC, independently of PD-L1 status.
The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.
One hundred female patients were enrolled, with most evaluable tumors being PD-L1-negative (97.6%).
The primary endpoint was met, with a median progression-free survival of 11.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.0-13.4; P < 0.001).
The objective response rate was 63.0% (95% CI: 52.8-72.4) and median overall survival was 27.4 months (95% CI: 23.4-37.4).
No treatment-related deaths or new safety signals were observed.
This combination demonstrated significant antitumor activity as first-line therapy for aTNBC patients and merits further investigation.
