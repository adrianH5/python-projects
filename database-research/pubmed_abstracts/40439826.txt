Twenty-one volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are markers for anthropogenic and biogenic emission sources were quantified in and around the city of Raipur, Chhattisgarh state in central India from November 2021 to February 2022 and from April to June 2022.
Spatiotemporal VOC patterns, implications for atmospheric reactivity and associated health risks are investigated.
Six monitoring sites represented the urban background, an industrial area, a commercial center, a residential neighbourhood, a refuelling station, and a traffic junction.
Ambient air was drawn through Tenax sorbent tubes followed by analysis using Thermal- Desorption Gas Chromatography Triple Quadrupole Mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS/MS).
Benzene (BeZ) concentrations were ~ 3-8 times higher than the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards of 5 µg-m
