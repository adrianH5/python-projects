Mutations in c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) can be primary oncogenic drivers of multiple tumour types or can be acquired as mechanisms of resistance to therapy.
MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are classified as type I or type II inhibitors, with the former binding to the DFG-in, active conformation of MET, and the latter to the DFG-out, inactive conformation of MET.
Understanding how the different classes of MET TKIs impact tumours with varied MET alterations is critical to optimising treatment for patients with MET altered cancers.
Here, we characterise MET mutations identified in patients' tumours and assess responsiveness to type I and II TKIs.
