Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a pediatric emergency, and rapid genetic diagnosis is necessary for proper patient management, leading to successful stem cell transplantation and gene therapy.
Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) requires early diagnosis to prevent infectious diseases and early detection of cancer.
We aimed to diagnose patients with SCID/AT as quickly as possible and link them to the best treatments via the primary immunodeficiency database in Japan (PIDJ) network.
