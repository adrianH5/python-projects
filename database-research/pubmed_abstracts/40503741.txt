Recent studies addressing the role of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have been published; however, there are challenges in generalizing the findings due to different prognostic characteristics depending on tumor location and resectability.
Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of AC in distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA), a common tumor subtype of CCA.
