VCP/p97 plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum related degradation pathways, and inhibition of p97 was shown to induce ER stress and subsequently cell death in a variety of solid tumors and hematoma.
For acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, inhibition of p97 activity leads to the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins, activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis.
