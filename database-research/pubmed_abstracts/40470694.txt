Autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis (ACAG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder whose diagnostic complexity arises from diverse symptoms mimicking other gastrointestinal disorders, often leading to misdiagnosis.
Despite diagnosis, patients are often treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) before consulting a gastroenterologist, emphasizing the need for accurate identification and management of ACAG in primary care.
This study aimed to explore factors influencing disease progression.
