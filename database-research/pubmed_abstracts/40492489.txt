Resections of the pancreatic body and tail reaching to the left of the superior mesenteric vein are defined as distal pancreatectomy.
Most distal pancreatectomies are elective treatments for chronic pancreatitis, benign or malignant diseases, and they have high morbidity rates of up to 40%.
Pancreatic fistula formation is the main source of postoperative morbidity, and is associated with numerous further complications.
Researchers have proposed several surgical resection and closure techniques of the pancreatic remnant in an attempt to reduce these complications.
The two most common techniques are scalpel resection followed by handsewn closure of the pancreatic remnant and stapler resection and closure.
