Meningioma, a prevalent central nervous system (CNS) tumor, exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical behavior, ranging from benign to aggressive.
Although surgical resection remains a viable treatment option for most cases, higher-grade meningiomas often require a multifaceted therapeutic approach.
Gene therapies have shown potential for use in clinical intervention for the treatment of several types of cancer.
Small nucleic acid molecules such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) can restore aberrant gene expression and selectively silence oncogenic drivers.
However, their clinical application could be improved by addressing challenges such as molecular instability, off-target toxicity, and limited bioavailability.
Despite the rapid progress in nanotechnology that has significantly improved the gene therapy delivery system, its use for meningioma treatment has lagged behind.
The lag in research can be attributed to the critical need for a deeper understanding of the molecular landscape of meningioma and its relative resistance to conventional chemotherapy.
Therefore, our review article focuses on the complex molecular landscape of meningioma and highlights the challenges in its treatment and management.
We also discuss the current gene therapy approaches for meningioma, exploring ongoing clinical trials and elucidating the mechanism of emerging therapies.
Furthermore, we investigate the potential of nanomedicine in enhancing gene therapy for meningioma, highlighting the need for innovative delivery techniques.
This comprehensive analysis not only outlines the status of the therapy in meningioma but also offers valuable insights into the future research direction and their clinical translation.
