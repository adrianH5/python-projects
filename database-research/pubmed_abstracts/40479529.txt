The field of environmental health sciences increasingly demands comprehensive and diverse datasets, particularly in response to emerging research areas such as climate change, mixtures, and exposomics.
The data needed to address the complexity of environmental health research questions often extend beyond the boundaries of a single study or data resource.
Traditional data management approaches struggle to harmonize the ever-expanding and heterogeneous data sources needed for research in the environmental health sciences.
Harmonization may help address this issue as it involves aligning and standardizing various elements of data to allow comprehensive analysis, data pooling and interpretation across studies.
