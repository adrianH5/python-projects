Bioinspired nano/micromotors with drug delivery capabilities are emerging tools with the promising potential to treat numerous diseases.
However, some major challenges must be overcome before reaching real biomedical applications.
Above all, it is necessary to design engines that employ biocompatible and bioavailable fuels to induce efficient propulsion in biological environments.
In addition, ideal nanomotors should also be capable of delivering the cargo on-command using selected stimuli.
To tackle these challenges, we herein present the design and evaluation (both
