This paper reports an innovative green nanotechnology approach utilizing electron-rich resveratrol, abundantly available in grape skin, to transform the palladium salt into biocompatible and tumor-specific resveratrol functionalized palladium nanoparticles (Res-PdNPs).
This 'zero carbon emission' process affords four types of nanoparticles: Res-PdNPs 1-4, wherein the phytochemical serves dual roles of a reductant as well as a nanoparticle stabilizer through the creation of a phytochemical corona.
Complete characterization has allowed selection of Res-PdNP-4 (zeta potential: -40 ± 3 mV; TEM core size: 24 ± 3 nm), with excellent
