Gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (G-EAC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of cervical cancer which is not associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection but has poor prognosis because of its high invasiveness and resistance to chemoradiotherapy.
The early and accurate diagnosis of G-EAC is challenging owing to its nonspecific symptoms and relatively normal cytological and histological manifestations.
