Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with early postoperative recurrence remaining a major cause of mortality.
Body composition and inflammatory-nutritional indices (BCINI) have demonstrated potential in reflecting patients' physiological states; however, their association with early recurrence (ER) after CRC resection remains unclear.
This study aimed to establish and validate interpretable machine learning (ML) models based on BCINI to predict ER after CRC resection.
