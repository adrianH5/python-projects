The monoclonal antibodies consist of an innovative form of immunotherapy, capable of defeating several diseases, such as cancer.
It is an emergent and important theme, that advances evaluation, challenges, and future perspectives with high relevance to identify gaps in recent studies and to consolidate this general theme in only one research.
Its action in Chronic and Acute Lymphoid Leukemia has been evaluated in several clinical trials, which were selected between 2022 and 2023, in order to understand better the monoclonal antibodies that were most studied.
The biopharmaceutical compounds Ibrutinib, Obinutuzumab, Rituximab, Venetoclax, and Inotuzumab Ozogamicin were the ones that most appeared in the most recent publications, indicating the importance of amplifying the studies.
The action mechanisms that are used imply that their combined use has more success in the disease remission, showing a lower recurrence, adverse effects, and toxicity.
Besides the adverse effects and overwhelming prices of the treatment, these immunotherapies results are promising, amplifying the survival rates, improving the patient's life quality, and resulting in a precision medicine, aiming a custom treatment.
The future perspectives on this therapy consist of its application in the public health system, with patients being able to be submitted to this treatment without any costs and receive a better life quality.
