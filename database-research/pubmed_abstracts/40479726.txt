Lung diseases remain a leading cause of mortality globally, posing a substantial challenge to public health.
Conditions such as asthma, tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer are highly prevalent and of increasing concern due to their rising incidence in recent years.
The recent global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further highlighted the urgent need for more effective therapeutic approaches to combat pulmonary diseases.
In this context, growing interest in nanotechnology for pulmonary drug delivery has emerged, driven by its potential to enable localized treatment, reduce dosages, provide controlled release, enhance drug solubility, and improve bioavailability.
Among the various nanomaterials explored, poly(lactic-
