Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are vesicle-like structures secreted by various cell types, playing a crucial role in cell communication.
As an efficient and safe therapeutic carrier, EVs offer new insights and methods for disease treatment and drug development due to high stability, low immunogenicity, and broad resources.
However, current applications on EV-based delivery systems are still challenging, and additional strategies are needed to achieve precise and targeted delivery, enhance stability and safety, and avoid unnecessary immune reactions or side effects.
This review summarizes the latest progress in using smart materials or devices to enhance EV delivery, aiming to provide a reference for designing novel and efficient EV-based targeted delivery strategies.
