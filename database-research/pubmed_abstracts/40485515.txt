Leukemia, a group of malignant blood disorders, arises from the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal white blood cells.
Genetic mutations play a critical role in the initiation and progression of leukemia.
This review aims to provide an overview of the genetic landscape of leukemia, focusing on the most common genetic alterations and their clinical implications.
A literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on genetic mutations in leukemia.
The identified studies were critically appraised to assess their methodological quality.
The present review highlights the key genetic alterations associated with different types of leukemia, including chromosomal translocations, point mutations, and gene copy number variations.
These genetic abnormalities can impact disease prognosis, treatment response, and overall patient survival.
A comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of leukemia is essential for accurate diagnosis, prognostication, and the development of targeted therapies.
Future research should focus on identifying novel genetic markers, elucidating the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis, and developing innovative therapeutic strategies.
