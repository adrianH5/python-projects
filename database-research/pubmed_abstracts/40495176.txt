Despite therapeutic advances, acute leukemia (AL) continues to impose a substantial global health burden, with persistently high incidence and mortality rates.
Notably, the prediction is that the number of incidence and mortality of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases will continue to increase to 184,287.88 and 165,537.59, respectively, by 2040.
Using Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 data, we assessed the worldwide AL burden from 1990 to 2021, analyzing trends by sex to inform public health strategies.
