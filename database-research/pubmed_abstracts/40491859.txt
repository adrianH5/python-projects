Elranatamab is a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
The registrational Phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359) trial was single-armed; the aim of this indirect comparison was to contextualize the efficacy of the most recent 28.4-month follow-up data cut from this trial, allowing for more mature data, with real-world data serving as an external control.
