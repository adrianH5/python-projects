Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and targeted therapies for CRC are urgently needed.
This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms through which rhein induces apoptosis in CRC cells, focusing on its influence on the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88)/toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway.
