Global elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) will require an effective cross-genotype vaccine.
The HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies but also contains epitopes that elicit non-neutralizing antibodies which may provide protection through Fc effector functions rather than direct neutralization.
We determined cryo-EM structures of a broadly neutralizing antibody, a moderately neutralizing antibody, and a non-neutralizing antibody bound to E2 to resolutions of 3.8, 3.3, and 3.7 Å, respectively.
Whereas the broadly neutralizing antibody targeted the front layer of E2 and the non-neutralizing antibody targeted the back layer, the moderately neutralizing antibody straddled both front and back layers, and thereby defined a new neutralizing epitope on E2.
The small size of complexes between conventional (monovalent) Fabs and E2 (~110 kDa) presented a challenge for cryo-EM.
Accordingly, we engineered bivalent versions of E2-specific Fabs that doubled the size of Fab-E2 complexes and conferred highly identifiable shapes to the complexes that facilitated particle selection and orientation for image processing.
This study validates bivalent Fabs as new fiducial markers for cryo-EM analysis of small proteins such as HCV E2 and identifies a new target epitope for vaccine development.
