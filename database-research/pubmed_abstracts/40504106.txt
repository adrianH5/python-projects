Cancer cachexia is associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and reduced survival in patients with cancer.
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 is a widely used cancer-specific health-related QoL questionnaire that comprises 15 scales, consisting of five multi-item functional scales, three multi-item symptom scales, six single-item symptom scales and a global health and quality-of-life scale.
Our study aimed to analyse the association of each scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire with cachexia and explore its influence on survival outcomes in patients with gastric cancer and cachexia.
