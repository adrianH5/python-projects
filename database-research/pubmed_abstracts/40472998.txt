Re-irradiation remains a medical challenge due to the high toxicity risk.
Proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT), which has already demonstrated a remarkable neurotoxicity reduction, could minimize that risk in the central nervous system re-irradiations.
The goal of this study was to perform the first evaluation of the anatomical and functional effects of pMBRT rat brain re-irradiations.
