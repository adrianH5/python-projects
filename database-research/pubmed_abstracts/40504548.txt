Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a critical prognostic factor affecting long-term survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Despite its clinical significance, the optimal postoperative adjuvant therapy for HCC patients with MVI remains undefined.
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) combined with lenvatinib vs PA-TACE alone in HCC patients with MVI.
