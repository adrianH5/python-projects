Early diagnosis of breast cancer leads to higher long-term survival rates.
The development of a germline genetic test, or polygenic risk score, to identify women at high risk of breast cancer holds the potential to reduce cancer deaths.
However, current tests based on SNPs do not perform much better than predictions based on family history and perform significantly worse in populations with non-European ancestry.
We have developed an alternative method to characterize a genome, called chromosomal-scale length variation, which can be applied to polygenic risk scores.
