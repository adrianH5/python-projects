Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have demonstrated significant potential for targeted imaging and drug delivery.
However, their effectiveness may be compromised by the nonspecific adsorption of serum proteins, forming a protein corona that traps surface ligands and interferes with receptor targeting.
This study investigates the impact of the branch morphology of anti-HER2 aptamer-functionalized gold nanostars (AuNS) on their ability to exert cytotoxicity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing cancer cells in the presence of serum proteins.
By controlling reaction kinetics using temperature in HEPES-mediated seeded-AuNS synthesis, we produced homogeneous populations of AuNS with varying branch lengths but comparable hydrodynamic sizes and concentrations.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that longer and sharper branches on aptamer-functionalized AuNS were significantly more effective at avoiding sequestration by the protein corona than shorter branches.
Subsequently, HER2-targeting AuNS with longer branches caused significantly greater cytotoxic effects in HER2-overexpressing SKOV3 cancer cells than did AuNPs with spheroidal morphologies.
The differences in the cytotoxic effect caused by spheroidal AuNPs and AuNS with shorter branches were statistically insignificant.
These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the AuNS branch morphology for improved receptor-specific drug delivery and targeted cancer therapies, offering valuable insights into nanomedicine design.
