This study aims to elucidate the biological mechanisms in the tumour microenvironment as read from images by comprehensive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) based on radiomic features that predict survival.
Furthermore, this study enables biological interpretation of survival prediction using radiomic features, which in turn allows for optimal treatment feedback to improve clinical outcomes.
