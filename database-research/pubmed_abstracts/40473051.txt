Although aspirin has become the prophylactic agent of choice for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention in low-risk patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), there remains a paucity of data in the literature on the efficacy of aspirin as a mode of chemoprophylaxis in patients who had recent cancer.
The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of aspirin versus other anticoagulant medications in primary THA patients who were diagnosed with a visceral organ malignancy within 1-year prior to their arthroplasty procedure.
