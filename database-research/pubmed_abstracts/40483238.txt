We conducted a multicenter, on-line questionnaire interview of 1576 men who have sex with men planning to undergo or having undergone 2-dose MVA-BN vaccination to investigate the risk for acquiring Mpox, Mpox-related knowledge, awareness and willingness of Mpox vaccination, and the vaccination status.
Upon the questionnaire interview, 794 (64.3%) people with HIV and 239 (69.9%) people without HIV had completed full doses of MVA-BN vaccination.
Participants engaged in high-risk sexual behavior within one year (aOR 1.57; 95% CI, 1.24-1.99) and having acquired sexually transmitted infections within a year (aOR, 1.97; 95% CI 1.41-2.76) were more likely, while those with education below university level (aOR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42-0.73) and lower knowledge level about Mpox transmission (aOR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.26-0.45) were less likely to complete full doses of Mpox vaccination, suggesting that promoting health literacy by providing information, education and communication on Mpox may improve the willingness of Mpox vaccination.
