Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery is a treatment option for esophageal cancer (EC).
However, concerns persist regarding cardiopulmonary toxicity and inconsistent daily target coverage due to anatomical changes.
To address these challenges, we implemented a CBCT-based online adaptive radiotherapy (oART) workflow for EC.
This study provides updated dosimetric results and evaluates toxicity and treatment response using daily oART on the Ethosâ„¢ platform for EC in the neoadjuvant setting.
