In Japan, biennial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening for gastric cancer (GC) has been implemented for adults aged â‰¥50 years as part of a population-based screening program.
This approach has facilitated early GC detection and demonstrated individual-level benefits.
However, due to a generational decline in Helicobacter pylori infection, a reduction in the long-term effectiveness of this strategy is anticipated.
Given the allocation of national resources, a cost-effectiveness evaluation is essential.
