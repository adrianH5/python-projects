To evaluate the frequency of total thyroidectomy (TT) for thyroid nodules cytologically classified as high-risk indeterminate (TIR3B) and to explore the impact of patient specific factors (PSFs) (some clinical variables) associated with TT for follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC).
Moreover, we aim to investigate the nodule size as a factor influencing the risk of malignancy (ROM) and the risk of aggressiveness of FTC.
