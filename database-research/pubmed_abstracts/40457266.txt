Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men and is projected to cause approximately 35,250 deaths in 2024.
The utility of total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing as a routine screening tool remains controversial due to limited specificity.
Therefore, the identification of novel, noninvasive biomarkers is essential for improving early diagnosis.
This study aimed to evaluate the methylation status of a specific CpG dinucleotide within the SPDEF (SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor) gene promoter in blood leukocytes of PCa patients, using benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples as a control group.
