Malignant hilar biliary obstruction is associated with a poor prognosis, making biliary drainage important for improving the quality of life.
Endoscopic simultaneous side-by-side deployment of uncovered self-expandable metal stents is a novel approach.
However, reliable clinical data on this method are limited.
This retrospective, single-center study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of simultaneous side-by-side deployment of self-expandable metal stents for malignant hilar biliary obstruction.
