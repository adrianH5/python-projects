Childhood cancer is a growing public health concern in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where over two-thirds of global pediatric cancer cases occur.
Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, malnutrition remains a major barrier to achieving better outcomes.
This study aimed to assess the magnitude of undernutrition and identify barriers to optimal nutrition among pediatric patients with cancer receiving treatment at a major referral hospital in Tanzania.
