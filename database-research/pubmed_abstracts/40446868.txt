The theory of tumor vascular normalization provides new possibilities for the rational use of anti-angiogenesis drugs and chemotherapeutics.
However, clinical implementation of vascular normalization strategies faces two key bottlenecks: figuring out the right dosage of anti-angiogenic agents to balance angiogenic and anti-angiogenic properties, and the technical challenge of real-time monitoring of transient normalization windows for best therapeutic timing.
Additionally, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) often antagonize this therapy by interacting with tumor vasculature.
In response to these challenges, in this study, anlotinib (ANB) was chosen as the model drug, and two drug delivery systems loaded with ANB were prepared and compared: sialic acid-cholesterol conjugate-modified liposomes (ANB-SL) and polysialic acid-modified electrostatic complexes (ANB-PSA).
The results showed that ANB-SL specifically targets TAMs, then enriches within the tumor, releases ANB, killing TAMs while inhibiting vascular endothelial cells, thereby achieving tumor vascular normalization.
