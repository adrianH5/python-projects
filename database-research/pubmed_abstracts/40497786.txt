Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the IL-1 cytokine family, is constitutively expressed in barrier cells such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts.
While the expression of IL-33 in regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been previously reported, its clinical significance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear.
This study aims to investigate the clinical relevance and biological role of IL-33 + Tregs in PDAC.
