Clinical decision-making in oncology is complex, requiring the integration of multimodal data and multidomain expertise.
We developed and evaluated an autonomous clinical artificial intelligence (AI) agent leveraging GPT-4 with multimodal precision oncology tools to support personalized clinical decision-making.
The system incorporates vision transformers for detecting microsatellite instability and KRAS and BRAF mutations from histopathology slides, MedSAM for radiological image segmentation and web-based search tools such as OncoKB, PubMed and Google.
Evaluated on 20 realistic multimodal patient cases, the AI agent autonomously used appropriate tools with 87.5% accuracy, reached correct clinical conclusions in 91.0% of cases and accurately cited relevant oncology guidelines 75.5% of the time.
Compared to GPT-4 alone, the integrated AI agent drastically improved decision-making accuracy from 30.3% to 87.2%.
These findings demonstrate that integrating language models with precision oncology and search tools substantially enhances clinical accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for deploying AI-driven personalized oncology support systems.
