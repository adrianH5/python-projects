Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SR/MA) are becoming essential tools in the fields of musculoskeletal research and cancer-related bone diseases.
This chapter provides a guide on how to design and conduct an SR/MA for basic science researchers and healthcare professionals who are learning the methodology.
The step-by-step format will aid the application of the procedures described.
Ultimately, we hope this chapter to provide a comprehensive introduction to SR/MA, lead to a better understanding of the complexity of the process and facilitate the appreciation of the evidence- and empirically-derived approach required.
