Patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are at risk of developing financial toxicity (FT) due to the high cost of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment and other cancer-related costs.
This theory-based study evaluated relationships between risk factors, patients' behaviors, FT experience, and health outcomes among survivors of CML.
