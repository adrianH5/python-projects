Investigate spleen diameter (d) and volume (v) relationship in patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) by determining volumetric thresholds that best correlate to established diameter thresholds for assessing response to treatment.
Exploratorily, interrogate the impact of volumetric measurements in response categories and as a predictor of response.
