Cell-based gene therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor-T, T-cell receptor-T, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies, have transformed the treatment landscape for certain cancers, yet their efficacy in solid tumors remains limited.
Next-generation therapies aim to overcome biological barriers, enhance potency and safety, and streamline development timelines through innovative approaches.
Recent advances in genome editing technologies have identified hundreds of gene edits that improve T-cell functionality in preclinical models.
However, the limited direct translatability of these findings and the impracticality of testing each of the individual edits in a traditional clinical trial highlight the need for more efficient strategies.This article provides an overview of genome-wide screens that identify gene knockouts and knock-ins to enhance T-cell function and the limitations with translating these results to human trials.
Next, we propose a novel clinical trial design for testing multiple gene modifications simultaneously within a single T-cell infusion product.
This approach would enable head-to-head evaluation of edits in an internally controlled setting, accelerating the identification of promising candidate edits.
Key considerations for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, non-clinical evaluation, and clinical protocols are discussed, with an emphasis on patient safety and ethical transparency.This framework is informed by insights shared at the "Unlocking Complex Cell-based Gene Therapies" workshop, held on May 6, 2024.
Co-hosted by Friends of Cancer Research and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, the event brought together participants from academia, the US Food and Drug Administration, and patient advocacy groups.
By fostering collaboration among these stakeholders, this innovative approach aims to accelerate the development of effective cell-based therapies for complex diseases.
