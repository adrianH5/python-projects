The landscape of diagnosis and treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer has seen an unprecedented evolution in recent years.
Incorporation of results from pivotal studies is crucial for state-of-the-art counselling of patients and to inform treatment recommendations.
However, in daily practice ambiguous situations may occur or various options may seem adequate.
Furthermore, specific national regulations, e.g.
availability of diagnostic tools and drug approvals, may influence treatment choices.
This paper presents the voting results of a Swiss expert panel that convened in August 2024 and discussed selected questions addressed by an international panel of experts during the Advanced Prostate Cancer Conference held in Lugano in April 2024.
The objective is to facilitate national harmonization of diagnosis and treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer and thereby providing a basis for discussion with individuals with prostate cancer.
