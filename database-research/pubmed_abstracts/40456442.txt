Bevacizumab (BEV), the most common antiangiogenic agent for treating ovarian cancer, prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) but does not significantly improve overall survival (OS).
Improving the limited clinical benefit of BEV remains a major challenge in ovarian cancer treatment.
Although several studies have explored the mechanisms underlying tumor resistance to BEV, the clinical translation of these findings to overcome BEV resistance has been limited.
