Early diagnosis of breast cancer relies on detecting multiple cancer biomarkers, which significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy.
In this study, we developed a novel electrochemical dual immunosensor for the simultaneous detection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and mucin 1 (MUC1) biomarkers.
The sensor is based on Ti
