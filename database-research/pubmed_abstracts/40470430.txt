Background Depression and anxiety are common psychological challenges among cancer patients, particularly those receiving palliative care.
These conditions significantly impact the quality of life but are often underdiagnosed and undertreated.
This study evaluates depression and anxiety prevalence in Saudi palliative patients using the Arabic Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), identifies psychological distress factors, and proposes clinical recommendations to improve regional mental health screening protocols in palliative patients.
Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 130 palliative care patients at King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.
The Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess depression and anxiety levels.
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), with a significance level of p<0.05.
Results Sixty-five participants (50%) had HADS for depression (HADS-D) scores of ≥8 (indicating depression), while 40 (31%) had HADS for anxiety (HADS-A) scores of ≥8 (indicating anxiety).
Women exhibited higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to men, though this difference was not statistically significant.
Pain and fatigue were strongly associated with higher rates of depression (p=0.014 and p=0.002, respectively).
Patients with metastatic disease showed lower levels of anxiety (p=0.011).
Patients taking antidepressants had significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety (p=0.024).
Conclusion The high prevalence of depression and anxiety among cancer patients receiving palliative care emphasizes the importance of implementing a routine psychological screening in oncology settings.
The study findings recommend that individuals exhibiting persistent and severe physical symptoms be assessed for possible mood disorders.
Contrary to expectations, metastatic patients reported lower anxiety levels.
However, this warrants further study to disentangle the roles of coping mechanisms, palliative interventions, and cultural factors.
