B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood.
In this study, through a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identify carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) as an essential factor in a subset of MCL tumors.
Our signal transduction studies reveal that CEACAM1 plays a critical role in BCR activation through involvement in two dynamic processes.
First, following BCR engagement, CEACAM1 co-localizes to the membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) by anchoring to the F-actin cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein filamin A.
Second, CEACAM1 recruits and increases the abundance of SYK in the BCR complex leading to BCR activation.
These activities of CEACAM1 require its cytoplasmic tail and the N-terminal ectodomain.
Considering that previous studies have extensively characterized CEACAM1 as an ITIM-bearing inhibitory receptor, our findings regarding its activating role are both surprising and context-dependent, which may have implications for BCR-targeting therapies.
