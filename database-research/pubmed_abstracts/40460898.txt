Cancer progression and the therapeutic efficacy of targeted treatments are increasingly recognized to be influenced by the gut microbiota (GM).
This is particularly evident in the context of immunotherapies, as the composition of the GM can modulate the immune system through different mechanisms.
Emerging evidence suggests that Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), a well-established tumor suppressor, may shape the GM by regulating immune and inflammatory pathways.
Altered RKIP expression within tumors can reprogram the tumor microenvironment and microbiota composition, ultimately influencing the response to immunotherapy.
In this review, we explore the complex interplay between RKIP, downstream pathway, the microbiota, and immunotherapy.
Drawing from both preclinical and clinical studies, we examine how RKIP and kinase inhibitors change microbial composition and immune modulation, and how these interactions affect immunotherapeutic outcomes.
A deeper understanding of these mechanisms could guide the development of more effective cancer treatment strategies and highlight the microbiome's potential role in shaping immunotherapy responses.
