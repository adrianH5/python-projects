Colorectal cancer (CRC) is recognized as a multifactorial disease, where both genetic and environmental factors play critical roles in its development and progression.
The identification of pathogenic germline variants has proven to be a valuable tool for early diagnosis, the implementation of surveillance strategies, and the identification of individuals at increased cancer risk.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has facilitated comprehensive multigene analysis in both hereditary and sporadic cases of CRC.
