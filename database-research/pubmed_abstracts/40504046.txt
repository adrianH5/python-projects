Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) is a debilitating injury that affects a person's ability to communicate and swallow.
Although clinical aspects are understood, how UVFP affects a person's employment and job security is poorly characterized.
This study aims to elucidate how frequently patients request job accommodations or experience job loss related to UVFP.
