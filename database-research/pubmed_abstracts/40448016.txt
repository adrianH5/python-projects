Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide, and specific treatment modalities are lacking.
Accumulating evidence suggests that hepatic inflammation plays a key role in the progression from hepatic steatosis to MASH.
Macrophages, especially anti-inflammatory macrophages, serve as natural immune cells that maintain homeostasis in the immune microenvironment.
Here, we aimed to reveal the role of anti-inflammatory macrophages in MASH and investigate the underlying mechanism involved.
