Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a tumor therapy that leverages the activation mechanisms of T cells in the immune system.
A key challenge in ICB is poor T-cell infiltration and low tumor immunogenicity.
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can increase tumor immunogenicity and make tumors more sensitive to ICB.
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) a major target for ICB.
In this paper, a novel carbon nitride/methyl pyrophaeophorbide a‑copper/folate (abbreviated as CNMCF) nanocomposite was prepared for induced ICD.
In CNMCF nanostructures, methyl pyrophaeophorbide a (MPPa) serves as the photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent, and copper ion serves as the chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent.
CNMCF not only induced ICD, but also alleviated tumor hypoxia.
This led to down-regulation of hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF-1α) and PD-L1, promoted T lymphocyte invasion, effectively enhanced tumor immunogenicity, and elicited strong anti-tumor immune response, thereby suppressing primary tumor growth and metastasis.
