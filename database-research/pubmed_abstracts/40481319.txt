Pineal cysts are benign lesions found in 1-4% of the population.
While surgery is indicated for patients with symptoms related to hydrocephalus or signs of tectal compression, most patients present with non-specific symptoms such as headaches, psychiatric disturbances, sleep dysregulation, dizziness, and fatigue, among others, where the role for surgery remains unclear.
Although the etiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the habenula, which is anatomically and functionally linked to the pineal gland, may contribute to these symptoms through its role in circadian rhythms, pain modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation.
