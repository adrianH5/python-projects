Gastrointestinal bezoars often occur as a complication of previous gastric surgery or in patients with altered gastrointestinal motility.
Complications associated with gastrointestinal bezoars include perforation, peritonitis, protein-losing enteropathy, and acute appendicitis.
Acute pancreatitis secondary to a duodenal bezoar is rare, and few studies have reported this complication.
We report a case of acute pancreatitis and subsequent duodenal obstruction caused by a large duodenal phytobezoar.
