Penicilazaphilone C (PAC) is a novel azaphilone isolated by our research team.
While known for its antitumor properties, the potential of PAC to trigger ferroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells remains unexplored.
This study aims to assess the ferroptotic induction capability of PAC and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.
Our results showed that treatment with PAC demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells.
Flow cytometry analysis and lactate dehydrogenase assay revealed various forms of cell death induced by PAC in both cell lines.
Specifically, flow cytometry analyzed 7-AAD-stained dead cells, and ferroptosis markers, such as lipid peroxidation BODIPY-C11 and Fe
