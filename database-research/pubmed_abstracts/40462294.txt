Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is known for its stepwise progression from healthy skin to premalignant actinic keratosis (AK), followed by a malignant transformation to SCC.
Unfortunately, less attention has been paid to changes in gene expression in the tumour microenvironment during this process.
We retrospectively selected early-stage cutaneous SCC tissue samples containing both invasive and premalignant portions and conducted a spatial transcriptomic experiment using a NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP).
First, we selected invasive and premalignant regions of interest (ROIs) for each tissue.
We then compared the gene expression patterns between the two portions (invasive versus premalignant) of the three segments: tumour cells, immune cells and fibroblasts, in each ROI.
As a result, early-stage cutaneous SCC tissue samples from 17 patients were selected for this study.
We identified 29, 14 and 15 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the invasive and premalignant portions of the tumour cells, immune cells and fibroblasts, respectively.
