Psychedelic compounds are emerging treatments for depression, capable of producing rapid and lasting symptom reduction after 1-2 administrations in the context of psychotherapy - a stark contrast to traditional antidepressants.

Clarifying these mechanisms is crucial for guiding future research and clinical innovation with psychedelics.
