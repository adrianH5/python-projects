Artificial intelligence-based facial recognition (AI-FR) is promising in diagnosis of diseases with distinct facial features.
Our team has retrospectively constructed an AI-FR system for Turner Syndrome (TS) based on 1295 facial photographs in previous research.
This study aims to evaluate this AI-FR system for TS screening in a prospective cohort in real-world clinic setting.
We also aim to elucidate the impact of complexity of facial features on diagnostic accuracy of AI-FR in this cohort.
