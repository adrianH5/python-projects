Smoking is a major public health issue worldwide, particularly in China where it is linked to serious diseases like lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.
The genetic basis of nicotine metabolism, which varies significantly between Chinese and Western populations, impacts the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing nicotine dependence.
Very Low Nicotine Content (VLNC) cigarettes are considered a promising strategy for smoking cessation.
However, their effectiveness may vary due to genetic differences, necessitating specific studies on the impact of VLNC cigarettes on Chinese smokers' nicotine metabolism rates.
