Malignant brain tumors often lead to death.
While improving future treatments is essential, end-of-life care must also be addressed.
To ensure equitable palliative care, understanding the place of death is crucial, as disparities may lead to inequity of care.
This study aims to identify the place of death in adults with malignant brain tumors in Sweden, and the potential associations with official palliative care status by the ICD-10 code Z51.5, sociodemographic factors, health service characteristics, and healthcare service utilization.
