A previous phase 3 FOHAIC-1 study demonstrated that hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of FOLFOX regimen displayed favorable outcomes in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, including those with high-risk features (main portal tumor invasion and >50% liver infiltration).
This study aimed to compare the treatment efficacy of HAIC-FOLFOX versus atezolizumab-bevacizumab in HCC patients.
