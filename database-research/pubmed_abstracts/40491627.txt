We present a case of an 81-year-old woman who developed facial pain, headache, hypesthesia, and diplopia.
Although the diagnosis was initially challenging, further evaluation revealed a lesion in the petrous apex.
Determining the nature of petrous apex lesions is often extremely difficult; however, due to imaging findings suggestive of malignancy or possible metastasis from another organ, whole-body CT was performed, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of metastatic disease from primary lung cancer.
Malignant tumors of the petrous apex are exceedingly rare and often asymptomatic in the early stages, contributing to their poor prognosis.
Neurological symptoms, such as facial sensory impairment, may indicate the presence of a petrous apex tumor and should prompt further imaging evaluation.
Moreover, because tumors in this region are frequently metastatic, a comprehensive systemic tumor search is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
