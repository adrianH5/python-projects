Immune checkpoint inhibitors are the go-to therapeutic option for relapsed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with unidentified oncogenic drivers when first-line platin doublet chemotherapy fails.
Meanwhile, few options exist for the treatment of relapsed patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Through the present study, we evaluate the efficacy and hematologic safety of rechallenging chemotherapy in the second line after the failure of platinum-based chemotherapy.
