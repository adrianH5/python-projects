Black and African Americans face a higher risk and greater mortality from lung cancer than other racial groups.
Despite the proven benefits of lung cancer screening, Black and African Americans, who derive even greater benefit from screening than other races, are less likely to participate.
This study aims to increase the uptake of lung cancer screening by employing novel platforms for patient-centered education and engagement.
