In NABUCCO, safety and efficacy of preoperative ipilimumab plus nivolumab were assessed in stage III urothelial cancer.
Encouraging responses were achieved and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (ipilimumab-high) appeared more effective than ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (ipilimumab-low).
We explored ipilimumab plus nivolumab response biomarkers and tumor micro environment (TME) treatment dynamics.
