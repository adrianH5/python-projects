Phototherapy, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), has demonstrated significant potential for cancer treatment.
However, the therapeutic efficacy of PDT and PTT is often limited by several challenges, such as the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, lack of tumor-specific targeting, incomplete tumor ablation, and heat resistance of tumor cells.
Herein, we report a novel theranostic nanoplatform (PCN-224-IrO
