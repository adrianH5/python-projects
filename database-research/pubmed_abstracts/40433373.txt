The COMPASSION-15 trial demonstrated that cadonilimab plus chemotherapy (CAD-CHM) confers clinical benefits over placebo plus chemotherapy (PLA-CHM) as a first-line treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
However, the introduction of cadonilimab substantially elevates treatment costs, and its cost-effectiveness relative to PLA-CHM remains undetermined.
This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of CAD-CHM compared with PLA-CHM from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system.
