Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is effective in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
However, given concerns about the possible impact of L-OHP-based chemotherapy regimens in the face of physical functional decline, the question of whether they should be actively recommended for elderly patients remains unclear.
This study evaluated the relationship between the Geriatric 8 (G8) score, which assesses overall function in the elderly, and the efficacy and safety of L-OHP-based chemotherapy regimens.
