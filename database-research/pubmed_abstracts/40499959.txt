Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), recognised as the predominant aetiological factor in ovulatory dysfunction-related infertility, accounts for approximately 70% of anovulatory infertility cases.
Patients with PCOS have significantly higher anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) levels than their counterparts undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for non-PCOS indications (eg, male/tubal factors).
Several studies have suggested that a high AMH level is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in IVF, particularly preterm delivery.
However, most of these studies are retrospective studies, and their results are inconsistent.
The majority of AMH measurements are conducted before pregnancy; however, AMH levels fluctuate dynamically during pregnancy.
There is a pressing need for a well-structured prospective study to definitively establish whether high AMH levels during pregnancy are associated with IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients.
