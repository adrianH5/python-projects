Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, has gained much attention due to its high food safety profile and broad biological activities, especial for anti-cancer activities.
However, its clinical application is limited by poor bioavailability.
In this study, we develop liver-targeted carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) nanoparticles named curcumin (CUR)-loaded dual ligand nanoparticles (DL NPs).
CMCS is modified with deoxycholic acid (DCA), lactobionic acid (LA) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), which are regarded as safe common food.
