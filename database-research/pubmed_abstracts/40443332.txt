In recent years,immunotherapy,particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors,has been widely used in the treatment of both solid and non-solid tumors,and it has become an important component of comprehensive gastric cancer treatment.
The clinical application of immunotherapy in gastric cancer has gradually expanded from first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer to perioperative treatment for resectable locally advanced gastric cancer.
The use of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy,targeted therapy,and other treatment modalities in the perioperative management of gastric cancer has injected new vitality into perioperative treatment strategies,establishing a novel model for comprehensive perioperative gastric cancer treatment.
However,the application of immunotherapy in gastric cancer treatment still faces challenges such as limited high-level evidence for perioperative use,drug resistance,and adverse effects.
In the future,efforts should focus on conducting high-level evidence-based clinical research on perioperative immunotherapy for gastric cancer,exploring and optimizing combined immunotherapy regimens,and delving into the molecular biological mechanisms of the tumor immune microenvironment in gastric cancer.
By leveraging artificial intelligence and big data platform technologies,further optimization of screening strategies for potential beneficiaries should be pursued,and personalized precision treatment should be employed to address and overcome the challenges faced by immunotherapy in gastric cancer.
