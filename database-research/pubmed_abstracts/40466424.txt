Metformin is a first-line drug in the treatment of type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.
Its main mechanism of action is the reduction of hepatic gluconeogenesis, improving insulin sensitivity and modulating glucose metabolism.
The benefits of metformin are not limited to glycemic control, as it also has cardiovascular effects, reducing the risk of acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality in people with T2DM.
Additionally, it has positive effects on lipid metabolism, metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease, and pulmonary pathology, as well as potential effects in preventing cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
Its impact on aging and the gut microbiota remains an area of ongoing research.
