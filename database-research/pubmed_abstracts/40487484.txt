Adenoviral vectors demonstrate encouraging clinical outcomes for B and T cell vaccines.
With such approaches, multiple payloads can be delivered, beyond the antigen itself.
Nevertheless, the human adenoviral vector serotype C5 (HAdV5) exhibits limited transduction efficiency to dendritic cells (DCs), therefore necessitating very high viral loads.
Targeting antigen-presenting cells (APCs) has remained challenging.
To solve this problem, we developed a versatile platform that employs modular retargeting adapters to enhance transduction of specific cell types, including challenging host cells.
By rational design, we constructed a dual-adapter for DC-SIGN and CD11c and demonstrate successful targeting of HAdV5 to human and murine DCs.
