Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) during esophageal cancer surgery can help to identify and preserve the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN).
To devise a useful parameter for prediction of left vocal cord palsy (VCP), we measured the electromyographic (EMG) amplitude of the left RLN and vagus nerve (VN) using intermittent IONM.
