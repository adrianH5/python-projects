Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are standard treatments for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer (RM-HNC).
However, variability in treatment response necessitates the exploration of predictive factors, including gut microbiota, which are influenced by antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and statins.
This retrospective study assessed the effects of these medications on the clinical outcomes of ICI-treated patients with RM-HNC.
