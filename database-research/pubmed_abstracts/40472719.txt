Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) often exhibits poor responses to chemotherapy due to mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOCs).
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, hyperactivated in CCA and crucial for cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, may contribute to CCA chemoresistance.
This study investigates the role of Wnt/β-catenin in CCA multidrug resistance phenotype and explores the therapeutic potential of combining chemotherapy with Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors.
