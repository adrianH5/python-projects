Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major global health challenge, with limited efficacy of current immunotherapeutic strategies.
Immunogenic cell death (ICD), characterized by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), offers a promising approach to enhance antitumor immunity.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an ICD inducer, may synergize with PD-1 inhibitors to overcome therapeutic resistance, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
