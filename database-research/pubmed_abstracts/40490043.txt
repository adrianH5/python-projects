Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine cancer that threats to the health of human being seriously, and characterized with resistance to various therapeutic modalities.
The therapeutic efficacy of oxygen-dependent chemotherapy is hindered by hypoxia within tumor tissue heavily.
Therefore, the supply of oxygen in situ is an effective strategy to improve the chemotherapeutic outcomes.
The emergence of nanomedicine open an novel gate for tumor treatment, however, there is still lack of nanoplatforms for sufficient oxygen supply to improve the chemotherapeutic efficiency.
In this study, MnO
