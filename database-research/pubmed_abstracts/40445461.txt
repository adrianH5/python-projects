Liver cavernous malformation (CM) is a slow-flow venous malformation in which involved vessels appear tortuous and enlarged, often surrounded by a dense collagenous matrix.
Endothelial cells (ECs) of affected vessels show disorganized junctions.
Diagnosis usually occurs by computed tomography.
Cavernous vessels are also observed in cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), a disease affecting brain vasculature and occurring following mutations in KRIT1, CCM2 and PDCD10.
Coexistence of brain and extra-neurological lesions has been reported.
In this study, for the first time, we describe the possible common molecular basis between liver and brain cavernous lesions.
