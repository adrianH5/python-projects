Proton beam therapy is an advanced treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
However, evaluating the response to treatment with tumor size alone is insufficient.
Herein, we used kinetic [18F]-FDG PET and diffusion-weighted MR imaging to monitor the biological responses to proton beam therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma mice to assess treatment efficacy.
Murine BNL HCC cells were orthotopically implanted into the livers of 8-week-old male BALB/c mice, which received 20Â Gy of the single dose in proton beam therapy.
The biological responses to proton beam therapy were assessed on pre-treatment and post-treatment days 1, 3, and 7.
