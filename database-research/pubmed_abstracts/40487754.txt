Thyroid cancer (TC) is one of the most prevalent endocrine tumors, and its incidence rates are increasing.
Recent studies have shown that TC disrupts the gut microbiomes (GM) by influencing the levels of thyroid hormones, estrogen levels, weight and insulin resistance.
Traditional treatments, including thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy and checkpoint inhibitors, also alter the GM.
Additionally, GM affects the proliferation of TC by influencing chronic inflammation and metabolism (e.g., effects on short-chain fatty acids and amino acid metabolism).
Notable changes in the GM of patients with TC include increased numbers of
