Isatin (1H-indole-2,3-dione) scaffold is an important heterocyclic building block which can be used for the design and synthesis of anti-cancer agents targeting tyrosine kinases, tubulin polymerization, carbonic anhydrases, and histone deacetylases.
There are also several lines of evidences demonstrating the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in cancer development and its potential as anti-cancer target.
Here we are going to review isatin-derived CDK2 inhibitors and their potential for developing new anticancer agents.
The purpose of this review is to present the importance of isatin scaffold for design of new CDK2 inhibitors from medicinal and biological viewpoints.
Furthermore, the in vitro and in silico studies, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) were also discussed.
The Insights derived from SARs provide crucial directions for the rational design of potent and selective isatin-based CDK2 inhibitors, which improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects of anticancer chemotherapy.
