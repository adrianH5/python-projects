Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remains a major challenge in oncology, with the tumor microenvironment playing a crucial role in disease progression.
This study investigates the function of the Tripartite Motif Containing 26 (TRIM26) in the CRLM microenvironment, focusing on its regulation of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization and its implications for metastatic growth.
