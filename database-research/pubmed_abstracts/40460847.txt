Claudin-18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.
Satricabtagene autoleucel (satri-cel; also known as CT041), an autologous CLDN18.2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, showed encouraging activity in previously treated patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer in phase 1 clinical trials.
In this Article, we report the primary results from the phase 2 pivotal trial (CT041-ST-01) investigating the efficacy and safety of satri-cel for gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.
