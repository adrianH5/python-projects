Genetic analysis of DNA samples from 180 patients with uterine leiomyoma (UL) and 98 women of the control group without UL showed that the frequency of homozygous AA variant of IL17A -197G/A gene polymorphism was significantly increased in UL (odds ratio, OR = 4.33; p = 0.0096).
The frequency of this variant was even more increased when it is combined with homozygote variants GG at positions 238 and 308 of the TNF gene.
The combination of the genotypes of these polymorphisms in the AA-GG-GG positions is not only widespread among patients with UL (OR = 12.22; p = 0.0054), but also was not detected in the control group.
On the contrary, heterozygous IL17A -197 GA in combination with TNF-863C/A, TNF-308G/A, TNF-238G/A, IL1B-31T/C, IL6-174C/G, and IL8-251T/A are detected significantly less frequently among patients with UL than in the control, with taking into account Bonferroni's correction for the multiplicity of comparisons.
The results obtained can be used in the personalized prognosis of predisposition to UL.
