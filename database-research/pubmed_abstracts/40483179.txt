The randomized phase 3 THOR study showed significantly longer survival with erdafitinib (pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor [FGFR] inhibitor) over chemotherapy in adults with FGFR-altered locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC) who had progressed during or after anti-programmed death-(ligand) 1 (anti-PD-[L]1) therapy (Cohort 1).
This exploratory post-hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib in the Asian subpopulation within THOR Cohort 1.
