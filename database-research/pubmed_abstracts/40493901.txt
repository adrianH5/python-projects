Bladder cancer (BCa) is approximately the fourth most prevalent diagnosed cancer in men and is three times less common in women.
Therefore, identifying biomarkers, developing more effective therapeutic strategies, and understanding the mechanisms underlying BCa tumor growth and progression are urgently required to improve survival rates.
Therefore, we aim to investigate the expression of PTEN/Akt in tissue samples of both non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients (n = 70) and human BCa cell lines T24 and 5637, along with the potent role of ellagic acid (EA) in the modulation of the PTEN/Akt pathway and the resulting therapeutic potential.
Results showed low-intensity nuclear or cytoplasmic PTEN staining or loss of PTEN expression in tumor cells and overexpression of p-Akt (Ser-473) with high intensity in the nucleus or cytoplasm.
EA treatment of T24 and 5637 cells reduced cell viability, inflammation (NF-ÎºB, COX-2), invasion (MMP-9), induced the caspase (cas-3 and cas-9) cascade signaling pathway, and induced cell apoptosis along with the suppression of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway after 48h in a dose-dependent manner.
Thus, these data suggested that the EA showed a strong potential anti-cancer effect in T24 and 5637 cells.
In conclusion, the expression of PTEN/p-Akt and the inverse relation indicated an alteration of the PTEN/Akt pathway, and such cases could benefit from treatment with EA in BCa.
