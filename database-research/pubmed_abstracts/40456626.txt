Microfluidic chip analytical technology based on micronanotechnology has shown unique advantages in efficient detection of biochemical samples.
Integrating micronanostructures, preprocessing, derivatives, and detection units on a chip can realize more efficient detection.
In this paper, a multifunctional microfluidic chip integrated with electromagnetic copreprocessing and fluorescence sensing was designed and developed for detecting trace cancer markers total prostate-specific antigen (t-PSA) and free prostate-specific antigen (f-PSA) in whole blood samples.
The copreprocessing mode included dielectrophoresis (DEP) separation and magnetic bead enrichment.
Blood cells were collected and excluded from the microfluidic chip by the DEP force generated by the inverted V-shaped interdigital array electrodes, achieving a 98% separation efficiency.
Simultaneously, severe interference of blood cells in the subsequent magnetic bead enrichment and fluorescence detection could be avoided.
The enrichment module consisted of the immunomagnetic bead Fe
