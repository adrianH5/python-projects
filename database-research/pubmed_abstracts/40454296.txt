Chronic-active antibody mediated rejection (caAMR) is the leading causes of long-term kidney graft failure.
Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has been suggested as a treatment, but data are conflicting.
We retrospectively studied consecutive adult kidney transplant recipients with caAMR or microvascular inflammation (MVI) without Donor-Specific Antibodies (DSA) and without C4d deposition (MVI + DSA-C4d-), who received TCZ as first-line therapy in two European centers.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and DSA were assessed one-year before and after TCZ initiation.
The study included 64 patients who received TCZ between July 2018 and September 2023.
The eGFR trajectory significantly decreased after TCZ treatment (-1.2 ± 0.2 vs. 0.03 ± 0.2 mL/min/1.73 m
