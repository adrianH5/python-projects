Interest in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has increased in recent years.
Several studies suggest that supplementation with these fatty acids decreases metabolic risk, plasma triglyceride levels and attenuates the loss of lean body mass, modulating the inflammatory response.
In adults with cancer, the results of different studies that have evaluated the effects of the administration of these fatty acids suggest that they can be used as adjuvants during treatment acting as receptor agonists, modulating different molecular pathways, reducing the inflammatory response, increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy and consequently improving the overall survival of cancer patients.
The role of nutrition in onco-hematological treatment has not been sufficiently understood, although nutritional status is a modifiable prognostic factor.
Currently, the evidence demonstrating the effect of supplementation with these fatty acids in pediatric patients with leukemia is limited.
It reports benefits related to the preservation of lean body mass, control of dyslipidemias, cardiovascular risk factors, and methotrexate hepatotoxicity during therapy.
Therefore, this review highlights the results of intervention studies with these fatty acids performed in the pediatric population with acute lymphoblastic leukemia published so far.
