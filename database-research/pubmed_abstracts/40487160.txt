Metastasis and recurrence are the main causes of failure in the treatment of ovarian cancer (OC).
Immunotherapy has brought new opportunities for cancer treatment, but the presence of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment limits its application in OC.
Here, we prepared a kind of intelligent nanomicelles that could inhibit OC metastasis and recurrence by combining photothermal tumor ablation and immune remodeling.
In this study, Indocyanine green (ICG), a photosensitizer and Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a Toll-like receptor 4 agonist, were encapsulated into the core of PEG-PLGA nanocarrier, and the surface was further modified with tumor-targeting peptide TMTP1.
The formed TP1-IM nanomicelles with enhanced tumor accumulation could enable robust photothermal ablation of the primary tumor, and induce immunogenic cell death, release tumor-associated antigens, and damage-associated molecular patterns to form an endogenous
