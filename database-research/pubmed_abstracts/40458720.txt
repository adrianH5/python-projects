Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) is a rare condition characterized by excessive gastric acid secretion due to gastrin-producing neuroendocrine tumors.
Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]Lutetium Oxodotreotide is an effective treatment for advanced neuroendocrine tumors, including those associated with ZES.
However, the gastrointestinal toxicity induced by ZES can complicate the administration of PRRT.
We present a case of a patient with metastatic G2 neuroendocrine tumor of the duodenum and ampulla of Vater who experienced severe gastrointestinal complications after the first PRRT cycle due to exacerbated ZES.
The implementation of a prophylactic treatment with high-dose proton pump inhibitors before and after the subsequent PRRT cycles allowed for the successful completion of the therapy.
This case highlights the importance of considering ZES-related complications in patients undergoing PRRT.
Proactive management with high dose acid-suppressing therapy can significantly improve patient tolerance and treatment outcomes.
Further research is needed to optimize the management of ZES patients undergoing PRRT.
