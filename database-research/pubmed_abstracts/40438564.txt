There is evidence for efficacy of high-dose single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SF-SBRT) for painful non-spine bone metastases (NSBMs).
This study ("BONE SHOT") assessed feasibility of same-day magnetic resonance-guided (MRg) planning and SF-SBRT delivery, recorded toxicity and assessed efficacy for treating metastatic patients with NSBMs.
