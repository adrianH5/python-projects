FARSB is a Î²-regulatory subunit of phenylalanine tRNA synthetase.
It is reported that FARSB was involved in cancer progression.
However, the molecular function of FARSB in breast cancer was unclear.
This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of FARSB expression and its relationship with immunity in breast cancer.
