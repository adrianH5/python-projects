Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignant mesenchymal neoplasm that rarely arises in the head and neck and thyroid lodge.
Researchers have documented only few cases in the literature.
We present the case of a young woman diagnosed with synovial sarcoma that originated in the thyroid region one year after a total thyroidectomy for a primary papillary carcinoma and eight years after chemo-radiotherapy for a lymphoma.
