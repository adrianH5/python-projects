Breast cancer screening (BCS) is a prevention strategy for breast cancer (BC) facilitating early detection and treatment.
BCS has been shown to be effective in reducing BC mortality and minimizing the need for more extensive invasive treatments.
Immigrant women's participation rate to BSC is lower than that of native women.
Interventions to support their informed decision-making could make a difference to this.
The aim of this review was to investigate the current evidence of interventions for supporting informed decision-making on attendance to BCS by immigrant women.
An integrative review was conducted by searching online databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus).
A quality appraisal of the articles was performed using Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal checklists and mixed method appraisal tool.
Data were extracted and synthesized using narrative analysis.
A total of 25 articles were included in the study.
Interventional strategies for supporting informed decision-making on attendance to BCS by immigrants were home visits, personal navigation service support, education sessions, and media-led information.
In summary, to ensure the effective adoption of interventions for immigrants, it is imperative to consider cultural and linguistic tailored interventions, involve family members, especially husbands, offer free BCS and navigation services to those with limited financial resources, and, most importantly, uphold women's autonomy in their decision to participate in BCS.
