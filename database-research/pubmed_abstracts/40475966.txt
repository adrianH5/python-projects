Sarcopenia and malnutrition are prevalent among elderly patients with gastric cancer, significantly impairing recovery and quality of life (QoL).
Effective interventions targeting both nutritional and physical deficiencies are critical.
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a home-based exercise combined with nutritional care intervention in improving nutritional status, patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) scores, and QoL among elderly patients with gastric cancer and sarcopenia.
