Gastric cancer (GC) presents a major health challenge owing to its late diagnosis, molecular complexity, and resistance to therapies.
In this work, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, are identified as critical factors in GC progression and treatment resistance.
These findings highlight the potential of ncRNAs in advancing diagnostic strategies and developing novel therapeutic approaches.
However, challenges in optimizing delivery methods and validating clinical effectiveness remain.
Future efforts should focus on integrating ncRNA insights into precision medicine and addressing these clinical barriers to improve patient outcomes in GC.
