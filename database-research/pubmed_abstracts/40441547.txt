A 13-year-old girl presented with enlarging hepatocellular adenomas and a history of glycogen storage disease type Ia.
Her liver function was well controlled by nutritional therapy.
The options of resection and transplantation were considered, and the patient was successfully treated with laparoscopic liver resection.
However, pathology revealed fatty liver, indicating that subsequent surgical treatment may be necessary.
Herein, we report the patient's clinical progress, including the strategy for determining the surgical approach.
In cases where the patient is a low priority for transplantation, laparoscopic liver resection is an important therapeutic choice, even though regrowth of residual lesions has been reported.
