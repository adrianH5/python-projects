Multiple primary malignancies (MPMs) are separate malignant tumors in the same patient that are not caused by metastasis or recurrence; they represent between 1.84% and 3.9% of all malignancies.
Synchronous MPMs, where the tumors are detected at the same time, are even rarer, with a rate of about 0.7%.
Moreover, synchronous primary neoplasms involving both the kidneys and ovaries are extremely rare and have been reported in only a few cases in medical literature.
