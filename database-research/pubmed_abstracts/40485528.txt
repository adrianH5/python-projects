Primary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) of the lung is a rare malignant neoplasm characterized by the presence of both carcinomatous and sarcomatoid components, typically presenting as a solitary pulmonary mass.
Imaging examination serves as a critical tool for the detection and evaluation of pulmonary lesions, the definitive diagnosis of PSC still relies on histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining results.
This study presents a pathologically confirmed case of PSC of the lung with a retrospective analysis of the clinical features and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings.
The purpose is to improve the diagnostic accuracy of this disease.
