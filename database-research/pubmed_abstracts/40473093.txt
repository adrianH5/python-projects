In recent years, many countries have implemented active surveillance (i.e., leaving the lesion untreated) as an option in younger women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 instead of excisional treatment.
This is mainly due to the high regression rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and the observed increased risk associated with excisional treatment.
Women with a previous history of excisional treatment for cervical precancer are at increased risk of subsequent anogenital cancer and precancer.
For a full assessment of benefits and harms of active surveillance for CIN2, we investigated the risk of non-cervical anogenital cancers and precancers in women undergoing active surveillance.
