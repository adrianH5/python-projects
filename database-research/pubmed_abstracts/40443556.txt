Neurotransmitter imbalance is an important pathological basis for epilepsy seizures.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a key hydrolase in the cholinergic system directly affects the metabolism of neurotransmitter.
Unfortunately, owing to the lack of reliable in situ imaging tools in the brain, the association between AChE and epilepsy has not been fully elucidated yet.
Here, we rationally designed a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (
