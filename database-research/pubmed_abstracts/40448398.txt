Cancer cachexia is a severe metabolic disorder leading to skeletal muscle atrophy.
Muscle wasting is a major clinical problem in cachectic patients, as it limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatments and worsens quality of life.
Nutritional support based on branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) has been shown to be a promising approach to counteract cachexia-induced muscle atrophy, but its efficacy is still debated.
Furthermore, the putative role of di-alanine (Di-Ala) supplementation has yet to be evaluated.
The present study therefore sought to assess whether BCAA supplementation, alone or in combination with a Di-Ala peptide, could attenuate muscle wasting in a preclinical model of cancer cachexia.
