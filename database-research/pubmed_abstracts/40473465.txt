Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are highly tumorigenic, self-renewable cells with a key role in tumor relapse, metastasis, and therapy resistance.
Effective CSC-targeted therapies remain an unmet clinical need, strongly dependent on the selection of suitable targets and thorough validation of therapeutic agents.
L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is a targetable CSC-associated biomarker aberrantly expressed in various malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC).
