The American Thyroid Association (ATA) updated guidelines for the treatment of thyroid cancer, leading to a less aggressive approach depending on clinical-pathological features.
As a result, the possibility to perform lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy has significantly increased.
The majority of thyroid cancers are indolent with an excellent prognosis, while only 15% of patients with well-differentiated carcinoma, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), have locally advanced thyroid cancer (LATC) at diagnosis.
We reviewed our practice in treating thyroid carcinoma over the last decade.
