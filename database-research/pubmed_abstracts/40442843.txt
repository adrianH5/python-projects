BRIGHTLIGHT was the first national evaluation of teenage and young adult (TYA) cancer services in England.
BRIGHTLIGHT evaluated care for TYA aged 13 to 24Â years at diagnosis and comprised six interlinked studies.
Young people have been involved in BRIGHTLIGHT design, operational troubleshooting and dissemination.
Divergent conclusions emerged from the programme, which healthcare professionals could not explain.
We sought to gather young people's interpretation of the results based on their lived experience of cancer.
