Background The optimal duration of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for maximum benefits remains unclear.
Recently, the long-term follow-up data from clinical trials suggest the existence of a durable response (DR) that maintains the therapeutic effect even after ICI discontinuation.
The study aimed to explore how the characteristics of ICI therapy influence the effectiveness of subsequent treatments in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods The medical records of 134 patients with NSCLC who received ICIs before December 31, 2022, were retrospectively reviewed.
We evaluated the impact of pretreatment ICIs on survival after completion of ICI administration.
Results Among the 116 included patients, long ICI use (≥180 days) was the only independent prognostic factor for post-ICI overall survival (OS) in the multivariate analysis (HR: 0.382, 95% CI: 0.206-0.708,
