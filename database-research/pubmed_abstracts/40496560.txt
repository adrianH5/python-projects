The Endocrine Multidisciplinary Tumour Board (EMTB) is a specialised board for endocrine tumours, including thyroid, adrenal, and rare endocrine neoplasms.
Although required by major guidelines, little is known about the current EMTB composition and working outcomes.
The present study aims to analyse the use and support provided by an experienced EMTB, highlighting the skills of this board.
