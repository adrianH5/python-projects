Metastatic brain tumors (MBTs) are the most common intracranial tumors, affecting up to 40% of cancer patients.
Traditional treatments such as Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) and Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) have limitations, including neurocognitive decline and potential tumor regrowth.
Minimally invasive keyhole craniotomy (MIKC) and Cesium-131 (Cs-131) brachytherapy offer promising alternatives due to their precision and reduced side effects.
This prospective study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining MIKC with Cs-131 brachytherapy in treating newly diagnosed brain oligometastases.
