Chemoprevention has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce cancer incidence by using pharmacologic agents that interrupt the carcinogenesis process.
This review discusses emerging insights and recent advancements in chemoprevention, emphasizing novel approaches in several cancer types.
Specifically, we examine breast cancer prevention, focusing on optimized endocrine therapy dosing to enhance adherence and minimize adverse effects while maintaining efficacy.
Additionally, the potential of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to mitigate obesity-related cancer risks is evaluated, highlighting their role in addressing an increasingly prevalent risk factor in the general population.
The review further explores strategies targeting colorectal cancer (CRC), specifically in familial adenomatous polyposis, a hereditary CRC syndrome that exemplifies the complex interplay between chemoprevention, genetic risk, and patient management.
In prostate cancer, we highlight the evidence supporting the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, detailing their effectiveness in reducing cancer incidence as well as their safety profile.
Across these areas, this review underscores the importance of precision medicine, advocating for personalized approaches that balance efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life considerations.
Ultimately, advancing chemopreventive strategies through targeted research and clinical trials is essential for reducing cancer burden and improving patient outcomes.
