Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in immune suppression, tumor progression, and metastasis within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of ovarian cancer.
While TAMs are known to promote T-cell dysfunction, the precise molecular mechanisms governing this process remain poorly understood.
Here, we performed an integrated analysis of six high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) single-cell sequencing datasets to investigate the molecular and functional diversity of TAMs in HGSOC.
We identified an SPP1
