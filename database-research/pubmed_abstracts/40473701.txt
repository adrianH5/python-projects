Zinc-finger protein 768 (ZNF768) is an emerging transcription factor regulating cell proliferation and senescence.
Although the role of ZNF768 in regulating cell fate decision has been demonstrated in vitro, its importance in controlling physiological and pathophysiological processes in vivo is still unclear.
Here, we report the generation of a transgenic mouse model allowing the conditional overexpression of ZNF768.
This was achieved by inserting an inverted Znf768 coding sequence surrounded by heterologous Cre recognition sites in the Gt(ROSA)26Sor mouse locus (FLExZnf768).
To study the impact linked to systemic overexpression of ZNF768, mice carrying the FLExZnf768 allele were crossed with CMV-Cre mice to produce a whole-body ZNF768 transgenic mouse (WB-ZNF768-Tg).
As expected, WB-ZNF768-Tg mice showed higher ZNF768 levels in various tissues.
These mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and did not display apparent phenotypes.
Because ZNF768 levels are often overexpressed in cancer, we assessed tumor development in WB-ZNF768-Tg mice.
However, ZNF768 overexpression was not sufficient to promote 3-methylcholantrene-induced fibrosarcoma and KRAS
