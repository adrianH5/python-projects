Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) caused by the accumulation of intracellular iron and lipids and is involved in many pathological processes, including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA molecules exceeding 200 nt in length that do not possess protein coding function can interfere with ferroptosis by binding ferroptosis-related miRNAs or proteins.
Recently, ferroptosis-related lncRNAs (FRlncRNAs) have been identified in cancer and non-malignant disease models, including inprediction of drug resistance, intra-tumoral immune infiltration, metabolic reprogramming and mutation landscape.
Here, we review FRlncRNAs in cancer and non-malignant diseases, from prognosis to treatment.
