Operable pancreatic cancer survivors with diabetes experience fatigue and engage less in diabetes self-management, which could lead to worse health-related outcomes.
However, little is known about the impact of having both diseases on aspects of fatigue and diabetes self-management.
This study aimed to compare characteristics of fatigue and diabetes self-management between operable pancreatic cancer (OPC) survivors with diabetes and people who have diabetes without OPC.
