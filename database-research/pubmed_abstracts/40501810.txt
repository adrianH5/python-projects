Cellular plasticity in mammary epithelial cells enables dynamic cell state changes essential for normal development but can be hijacked by breast cancer cells to drive tumor progression.
However, the molecular factors that maintain cellular plasticity through the regulation of a hybrid cell state (epithelial/mesenchymal) are not fully defined.
As LMO2 has been previously shown to regulate metastasis, here we determined the role of LMO2 in the normal mammary epithelial cells.
Using lineage tracing and knockout mouse models we find that
