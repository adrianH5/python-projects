Active surveillance (AS) strategy aims to avoid unnecessary or excessive early treatment in patients at a low risk for prostate cancer (PCa).
However, a biomarker that can predict the need for early curative treatment in patients under AS has not been identified to date.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of inflammatory biomarkers in predicting the requirement of curative treatment in the early period in patients under AS.
