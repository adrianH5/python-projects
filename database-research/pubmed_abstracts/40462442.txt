This workshop examined the effects of ionizing radiation on certain understudied populations, including pregnant/lactating, in utero, pediatric, and geriatric populations.
Research using animal models has revealed significant age and condition-related differences in radiation-induced injuries, highlighting the need for tailored triage and treatment strategies.
Historical data from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl further support these findings, demonstrating that radiation effects lead to wide-ranging issues with unique profiles during pregnancy, childhood and elderly age.
While some research has been conducted on these groups, ethical and logistical challenges make it difficult to study these populations extensively.
Therefore, developing alternative approaches that offer promising avenues for further research is critical.
Radiation-induced biomarkers and biodosimetry also show age-related differences, including distinctive metabolic disruptions, necessitating further validation of biodosimetry tools.
These findings emphasize the importance of considering age, sex, and demographic factors in preclinical and clinical radiation research to develop treatments that improve outcomes of understudied populations after a radiological or nuclear public health emergency.
