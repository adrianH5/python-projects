Cervical cancer ranks among the most prevalent malignancies impacting women globally.
Disulfidptosis represents a recently identified pathway of cellular demise, although its role in the context of cervical cancer is not well elucidated.
This research investigates the significance of Disulfidptosis-Related Genes (DRGs) within cervical cancer.
Furthermore, it aims to analyze the differences in prognosis and immune infiltration among different molecular subtypes.
