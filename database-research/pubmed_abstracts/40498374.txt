High mobility group (HMG) proteins, the second most abundant chromatin proteins after histones, play essential roles in eukaryotic gene regulation.
Among these, High Mobility Group Box 3 (HMGB3) is critical for DNA repair and has gained prominence in cancer biology due to its involvement in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
This study explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HMGB3's oncogenic functions, with a focus on its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.
We highlight that HMGB3 is frequently overexpressed in tumor tissues and discuss its association with poor clinical outcomes.
Furthermore, we examine the ceRNA network and other regulatory pathways influencing HMGB3 expression, emphasizing their implications for RNA-based therapies.
By comprehensively reviewing HMGB3's role across multiple cancer types, this work provides insights into novel strategies for targeting HMGB3 to improve cancer treatment efficacy.
Our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of modulating HMGB3 expression and pave the way for future research into precision oncology approaches.
