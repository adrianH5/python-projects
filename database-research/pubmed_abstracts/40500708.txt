Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide.
Colorectal cancer has a poor survival rate because it tends to metastasise to the liver and other organs.
PELI2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is down-expressed in a variety of tumors.
However, the role of PELI2 in colorectal cancer has not been revealed.
In the present study, we found that expression level of PELI2 were reduced significantly in colorectal tumors compared with normal tissues.
Patients with low level of PELI2 expression tended to have poor prognosis.
Moreover, PELI2 decreased the proliferation, migration and anti-apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells in vitro.
We also constructed xenograft tumor model to verify colorectal tumor growth slowed down after PELI2 overexpression.
Transcriptome analysis suggested that PELI2 suppressed colorectal cancer progression via the MAPK signaling pathway.
In brief, our study shows that PELI2 inhibits colorectal cancer development by MAPK signaling pathway.
