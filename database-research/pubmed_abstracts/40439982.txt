The Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) aimed to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among U.S. medically underserved populations through promotion and provision of CRC screening.
We used simulation modeling to estimate the lifelong health impact and program cost-effectiveness of direct screening services, typically a single cycle of routine screening/follow-up testing provided through the CRCCP ("intervention").
