Glioma is still one of the most aggressive and common types of brain and central nervous system cancer, with few effective treatment options.
Despite progress in therapy, there is a requirement for new methods to enhance patient outcomes.
Doxorubicin (DOX), a type of anthracycline that has been proven to be effective in different cancers, encounters difficulties in treating glioma because of the blood-brain barrier.
This systematic review is intended to assess the effects of DOX on the survival and quality of life of glioma patients.
