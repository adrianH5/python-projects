Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which arise from peripheral nerves or cells associated with nerve sheaths, are uncommon and biologically aggressive sarcomas.
Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have exhibited antitumor efficiency in various sarcomas.
However, there have been few reports on the clinical features and treatment response of ICIs in MPNSTs.
