Liver cancer is the sixth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent type, accounting for nearly 90% of all liver cancer cases.
The first-line systemic therapy for advanced HCC includes lenvatinib, an oral multi-kinase tyrosine inhibitor.
However, many HCC patients exhibit resistance to lenvatinib, leading to treatment failure.
Recent studies suggest that lenvatinib resistance is multi-factorial.
