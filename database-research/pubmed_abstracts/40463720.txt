Louisiana faces significant environmental health challenges due to elevated air toxicity near industrial sites.
The state hosts over 300 manufacturing facilities, more than 150 petrochemical plants, and 15 refineries, which, although economically beneficial, pose significant health risks to surrounding communities.
Exposure to industrial emissions has been linked to respiratory conditions such as asthma, reproductive disorders, kidney damage, and various cancers.
An 85-mile stretch along the Mississippi River, commonly referred to as "Cancer Alley," has long been associated with elevated cancer rates, particularly among communities with high social vulnerability.
