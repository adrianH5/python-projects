Metastasis, the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant organs, is the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients.
This process often exhibits a preference for specific organs, a phenomenon known as tumor organotropism.
This study focuses on the organotropism of breast cancer and analyzes its genomic alterations following metastasis to four organs (bone, brain, liver, and lung).
The research aims to explore the intrinsic characteristics of primary breast cancer and the interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) within these target organs.
Building upon this foundation, we developed a deep learning model to identify organ-specific metastatic genes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of metastasis.
