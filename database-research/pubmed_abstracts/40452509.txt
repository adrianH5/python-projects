Screening and early detection of cancer is one of the challenges currently facing researchers.
Cancer is a non-communicable disease that annually causes many deaths in the world.
Therefore, finding new biomolecules to be used as biomarkers in cancer diagnosis is very important.
Recently, miRNAs have been introduced as potential biomarkers for the early detection of cancers.
Several detection techniques are employed for miRNA determination, among which biosensing and rapid tests are favored due to their affordability and portability.
However, due to the low-level concentration of biomarkers at the early stage of cancer, sensitive biosensors with low detection limits (nM to pM) are required.
When nanomaterials are used in designing biosensing platforms, this challenge is largely resolved.
MXenes and MBenes are two-dimensional nanomaterials that have this potential.
Recent research reports reveal that these two-dimensional materials, particularly MXenes, have exhibited promising capabilities in miRNA detection methods, like electrochemiluminescence (ECL), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and electrochemical biosensing.
This review comprehensively explores the results, challenges, and underlying mechanisms in utilizing these materials for miRNA detection.
Overall, MXenes and MBenes demonstrate considerable promise in this area, opening up new avenues for further research and development.
