ObjectivesThis study aims to assess hepatic clinicopathological changes in cats with different hepatobiliary diseases and to assess whether specific serum biochemistry changes can help differentiate these diseases.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on serum biochemistry data from 93 cats with hepatobiliary diseases and 80 control cats.
Of the 93 cats with definitive diagnoses of hepatobiliary diseases, 22 had cholangitis, 14 had hepatic lipidosis, 18 had primary hepatic neoplasia confirmed via Tru-cut or laparotomic wedge biopsy and 39 had congenital portosystemic shunting (CPSS) confirmed by abdominal ultrasound.
The biomarkers analysed were alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl-transferase (GGT), total bilirubin and albumin.ResultsCats with hepatobiliary disease had significantly higher enzyme activities, total bilirubin concentrations and lower albumin concentrations compared with controls (
