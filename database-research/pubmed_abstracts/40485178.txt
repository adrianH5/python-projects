Chemotherapy is the basis of cancer treatment.
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major adverse effect.
CIPN has a high incidence rate and substantially affects the quality of life of cancer survivors.
Despite this, no definitive treatment for persistent unmet medical needs is available.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), widely used to treat obesity and diabetes, have recently been reported to be efficacious in treating neuropathic pain.
The authors aimed to confirm its effects on CIPN and elucidate its underlying mechanisms.
