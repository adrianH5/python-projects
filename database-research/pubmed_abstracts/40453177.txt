The present study provides the design, synthesis, molecular modelling investigation and biological evaluation of a series of coumalic acid-based selective inhibitors of hCA IX and XII.
Based on the previously obtained results with carboxamide analogues of coumalic acid, here we explored some modifications of the original scaffold with the aim to expand our knowledge about these compounds and to promote structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies.
Structural modifications as lactone-to-lactam conversion, repositioning of the carboxylic acid moiety, and the introduction of ester or amidic linkers, as well as triazole-based elongation
