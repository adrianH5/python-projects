Despite extensive research, the topic of anti-PD-L1 small-molecule inhibitors remains elusive.
Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and bioevaluation of a series of small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors via optimization of the solvent-interaction region.
Among them, compound GJ19 showed the most potent anti-PD-L1 effects with an IC
