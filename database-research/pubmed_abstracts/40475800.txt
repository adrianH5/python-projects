Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a serious but rare cause of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy which poses a significant morbidity and mortality burden to the maternofetal dyad.
Diagnosing TTP in pregnancy is challenging due to its non-specific clinical presentation, and the potential for similar or concomitant presentation with other thrombotic microangiopathies.
We present an atypical case of TTP diagnosed in an asymptomatic 28-year-old female, at 35 weeks' gestation.
TTP must be considered a differential for thrombocytopenia, especially in the context of autoimmune disease and even in the absence of typical signs or symptoms.
Increasingly available diagnostic tools may help redefine our understanding of TTP presentations in pregnancy.
