We previously reported the results of a prospective observational study evaluating activities of daily living (ADL) at six months after curative surgical resection in patients aged ≥75 years with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
In this manuscript, we report the 24-month longitudinal ADL outcomes in this population, providing important data to support treatment decision-making and to identify risk factors for long-term functional decline.
