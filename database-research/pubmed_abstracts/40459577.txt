The clinical success of metal-based anticancer agents can be achieved by developing not only an efficient metallodrug but also a suitable drug delivery system (DDS).
Although spatiotemporal delivery, enhancing the efficacy, and alleviating toxicity are achievable, modifying the mechanism of action of metallodrugs using a nano DDS remains scarce.
With all this in mind, a series of cyclometalated ruthenium(II) half-sandwich complexes of the type [(Î·
