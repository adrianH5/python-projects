Abiraterone acetate is indicated for high-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
However, abiraterone acetate is significantly associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI).
In this study, we report severe cases of abiraterone acetate-induced liver injury in patients with prostate cancer.
