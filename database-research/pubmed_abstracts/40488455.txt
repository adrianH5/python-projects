Vulvar cancer is one of the rare malignancies affecting women, but its incidence and younger age diagnoses are increasing through time.
Because of its rarity, and low interest in medical society, limited research has been undertaken, especially on the risk factors.
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of HIV infection and other factors on vulvar cancer.
