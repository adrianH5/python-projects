Nuclear receptor related 1 (Nurr1) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and considered as neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory target.
Several lines of evidence support potential of Nurr1 modulation in treating neurodegenerative diseases as well as in certain cancers, but potent and selective Nurr1 modulators are rare.
