CD73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase) is a metabolic immune checkpoint that dephosphorylates AMP to produce adenosine.
Adenosine plays a pivotal role in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) through adenosine receptors expressed on various immune cells.
AB680, a specific CD73 inhibitor, is currently undergoing clinical trials for highly refractory cancers.
In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects and mechanisms of AB680 in glioblastoma (GBM).
