Cervical cancer is a preventable disease for which vaccines are available to provide long-term protection against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
This systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to summarize the efficacy, effectiveness, impact, duration of protection, and safety profile of four licensed HPV vaccines against infection, precursor lesions, and cervical cancer.
Data was extracted from published reports.
The search resulted in 1,136 studies, of which 54 were selected for this review.
A substantial decrease in the prevalence of oncogenic HPV types, high-grade cervical lesions, and cervical cancer was found in countries with high vaccine coverage and routine vaccination programs.
Post-licensure studies of HPV vaccines have reported high efficacy, effectiveness, and health impact across settings and age groups.
Studies emphasize vaccination in younger age groups.
These findings may inform future discussions about HPV vaccination strategies.
