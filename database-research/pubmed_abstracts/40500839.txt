Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) are very rare, aggressive soft-tissue neoplasms developing from and involving the peripheral nerve sheath.
MPNSTs are difficult to diagnose and treat and they contribute to significant morbidity and mortality for patients.
18F-FDG PET/CT is valuable in diagnosing and staging as well as guiding therapeutic interventions, especially therapy response assessment in MPNST.
As the incidence is very low, a valid statement at this point with respect to its role in patient management and optimal care is not defined.
The current review will venture to use the available literature to define a role of this modality in the various aspects of management of MPNST.
