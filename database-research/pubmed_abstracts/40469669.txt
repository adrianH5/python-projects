Cancer cachexia is a complex syndrome marked by appetite loss, weakness, fatigue, significant weight loss, and depletion of both adipose and muscle tissue, driven by metabolic and inflammatory alterations caused by tumors.
Cachexia is a critical contributor to poor cancer prognosis, often leading to reduced efficacy of treatments.
