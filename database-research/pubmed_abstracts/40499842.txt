The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in cancer onset and progression.
Its significance has been increasingly addressed in myeloid neoplasms.
Such a shift marks a departure from the usual tumor-centered approach to a more comprehensive and integrated understanding of the interplay between myeloid tumors and their surroundings.
On this note, we aimed to summarize, in this review, an up-to-date take on how a pro-inflammatory milieu influences clonal selection of genetically altered hematopoietic stem cells towards myeloid malignancies at the expense of their healthy counterpart; the role of NLRP3 inflammasome, a major component of the innate immunity and source of interleukin-1Î², over acute myeloid leukemia development and performance; and, alongside post-translational modifications, how autophagy represents a major NLRP3 inflammasome regulator.
