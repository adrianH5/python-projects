Previous studies have highlighted the prominent role of age in lung cancer risk, with signs of lung aging visible in computed tomography (CT) imaging.
This study aims to characterize lung aging using quantitative radiomic features extracted from five delineated lung lobes and explore how age contributes to lung cancer development through these features.
