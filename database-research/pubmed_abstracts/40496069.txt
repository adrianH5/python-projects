The "hallmarks of cancer" concept provides a valuable framework for understanding fundamental organizing principles common to various cancers.
However, without a consensus gene set for cancer hallmarks, data comparison and integration result in diverse biological interpretations across studies.
Therefore, we aimed to form a consensus cancer hallmark gene set by merging data from available mapping resources and establishing a framework for mining these gene sets.
By consolidating data from seven projects, 6763 genes associated with 10 cancer hallmarks were identified.
A cancer hallmarks enrichment analysis was performed for prognostic genes associated with overall survival across 12 types of solid tumors.
"Tissue invasion and metastasis" was most prominent in cancers of the stomach (
