Stauffer syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with Renal Cell Cancer (RCC), seen in 3 %-20 % of cases characterized by reversible nonmetastatic anicteric, hepatic dysfunction in the absence of direct hepatobiliary obstruction.
We report a case of 78-yr old male, post Whipple surgery who presented with progressive and isolated elevation of Aminotransferases.
Imaging confirmed the presence of a renal mass without hepatic metastasis.
The patient underwent partial nephrectomy.
The patient's clinical course, management, and subsequent resolution of hepatic dysfunction after resection underscore the importance of considering Stauffer syndrome in patients with unexplained liver test abnormalities.
