Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, with various molecules, including vasohibin (VASH), nitric oxide (NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), implicated in its regulation and potential prognostic value in oncology.
However, their roles in modulating surgery-induced angiogenesis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain unclear.
Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess the dynamic changes in VASH, NO, and iNOS levels in HNSCC patients undergoing surgical resection.
