Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with prostate cancer.
ADT can induce body composition change; however, the association between body composition change and cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear.
This study aimed to determine the association between ADT-induced body composition change and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.
