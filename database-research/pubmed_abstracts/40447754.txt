Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of regulated cell death, characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species, which has been implicated in a number of human diseases.
However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying ferroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear.
In this study, we unravel the pivotal role of PRMT5 in the progression of CRC by promoting ferroptosis resistance.
Mechanistically, PRMT5 directly inhibits the transcription of m
