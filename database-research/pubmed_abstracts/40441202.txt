Trousseau syndrome is a well-recognized paraneoplastic syndrome that manifests as thrombosis in patients with malignancies.
It is particularly associated with mucin-producing adenocarcinomas and is known to lead to significant morbidity and mortality due to its thrombotic complications.
The underlying mechanisms involve a hypercoagulable state induced by cancer-related factors, which necessitates vigilant monitoring and management.
