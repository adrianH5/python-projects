Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent incident cancer among males in industrialized countries, but little is known about its aetiology.
A role for occupational exposures is suggested.
Occupational exposure as a firefighter, a protective service occupation (PSO), is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with limited evidence in humans for PCa.
We studied the association between PSO and PCa risk considering tumour aggressiveness and screening practices.
