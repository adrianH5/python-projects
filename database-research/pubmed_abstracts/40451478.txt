Most Cluster Randomised Trials (CRTs) include fewer than 50 clusters, yet the assumption of a "large sample" is relied upon to derive the sampling distributions of treatment effects.
We review the current simulation study literature pertaining to small sample corrections for common analytical approaches for parallel CRTs.
