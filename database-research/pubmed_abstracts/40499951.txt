Lymphangiosarcoma, or Stewart-Treves syndrome, is a rare and aggressive malignancy.
It is associated with poor prognosis due to its high risk of recurrence and metastasis.
This case report highlights the surgical challenges faced in managing lymphangiosarcoma.We present a case of a woman in her 60s who underwent modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant therapy for breast carcinoma.
She developed lymphangiosarcoma of the upper limb and underwent limb disarticulation.
6 months later, she presented with recurrent angiosarcoma at the amputation site.
A wide local excision was performed, followed by reconstruction with a free anterolateral thigh flap.
