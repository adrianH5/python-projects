Systemic responses during tumor progression reshape granulopoiesis.
In this issue of Cancer Cell, Garner et al.
show that tumor-derived signals reprogram neutrophil development early in myelopoiesis.
IL-1Î² blockade restores granulopoiesis, reverses neutrophil immunosuppressive imprinting, and reduces metastasis, highlighting a promising strategy for targeting neutrophil plasticity in cancer.
