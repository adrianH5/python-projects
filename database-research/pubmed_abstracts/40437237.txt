Older adults with cancer have a higher risk of unplanned hospitalizations, necessitating tailored interventions to improve treatment outcomes.

Therefore, we aimed to explore whether frailty assessment enhances the prediction of unplanned hospitalizations in older adults with cancer with an excellent ECOG PS undergoing antitumor therapy.
