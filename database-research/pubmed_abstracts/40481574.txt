Sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT) is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-TROP2 monoclonal antibody coupled to a cytotoxic belotecan-derived topoisomerase I inhibitor (KL610023) via a novel linker.
We report results from theÂ phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts in advanced solid tumors and phase 2 expansion cohorts for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) from the first-in-human MK-2870-001 (KL264-01) study (NCT04152499).
