Cervical cancer remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
Screening of cervical cancer is crucial because it can detect precancerous changes and early-stage cancer.
Regard to the screening methods, combination of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cytological examination has superior sensitivity and specificity compared to cytology alone.
Thus, recent guidelines recommend this combined approach instead of cytology alone to reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality.
By using this combination, HPV testing identifies high-risk strains associated with cervical cancer, while cytology helps detect abnormal cellular changes.
This dual strategy enhances early detection rates, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.
Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that this screening strategy also significantly reduced detection costs, indicating the potential for this screening strategy to be promoted, especially in economically constrained regions.
Despite challenges in screening, such as accessibility, public awareness, and cultural attitudes, educating communities on the importance of HPV testing and cytology can improve participation rates.
Overall, a combined HPV testing and cytology screening strategy represents a proactive approach to cervical cancer prevention, promising to save lives through early detection and treatment.
