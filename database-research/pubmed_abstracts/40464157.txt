Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is a complex condition affecting 1 in 3000 pregnancies worldwide.
While clinical management has improved, the optimal staging approach for PABC remains uncertain.
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) imaging is a standard diagnostic tool for many cancers.
However, its use in PABC staging is controversial due to potential radiation risks to the foetus.
