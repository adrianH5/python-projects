Digital Papillary Adenocarcinoma (DPA) is a rare tumor that can cause metastasis and death.
It can morphologically mimic benign sweat gland tumors.
In 2022, the novel association of HPV-42 and DPA was discovered by means of DNA sequencing.
In this scoping review, we aimed to systematically evaluate alternatives to HPV-42 molecular sequencing.
Of 87 articles on DPA identified in a PUBMED meta-search, eight met the inclusion criteria.
We found that DNA sequencing for HPV-42 is most sensitive (94%).
Comparable tests included HPV-42 in situ hybridization (ISH), which had 82% sensitivity, and p16 immunohistochemistry, which had 70%-75% sensitivity.
We further evaluated the performance of HPV-42 ISH and performed a stratified analysis of HPV-42 ISH-negative DPA cases.
There was a statistically significant difference in HPV-42 positivity in patients younger than and older than 60 years old (p = 0.02).
We recommend HPV-42 ISH for cases with equivocal morphology from patients aged over 60 years.
Tumors with equivocal morphology from patients under the age of 60 years should be sequenced for HPV-42.
For cases with classic morphology, p16 can be used to support the diagnosis, but molecular testing for HPV-42 is unnecessary.
