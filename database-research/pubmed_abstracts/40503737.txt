Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a malignant tumor with a high incidence rate and mortality rate.
This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of dendritic cell cytokine-induced killer cell (DC-CIK) bioimmunotherapy in advanced NSCLC.
Sixty-four NSCLC patients treated in our hospital from June 2019 to February 2021 were chosen as the DC-CIK group, all of whom received DC-CIK bioimmunotherapy based on synchronous radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Following the 1:1 matching principle, another 64 NSCLC patients treated with synchronous chemotherapy admitted at the same time were picked as the control group.
The clinical efficacy, adverse effects, survival period, the content of immune-related indexes (NK, CD3
