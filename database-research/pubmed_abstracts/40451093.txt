Pregnancy requires that the development of immune tolerance to avoid fetal rejection is balanced with functional immune surveillance mechanisms against infectious pathogens.
Trophoblast cells play a unique role in influencing the state of maternal and fetal immune activation.
Placental growth factor (PlGF), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, is a placental-derived factor with maximal expression during early third trimester, when women are at particular risk of morbidity from viral infections.
Having previously demonstrated that PlGF enhanced toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammatory cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes, we hypothesized that PlGF might also contribute to hyper-inflammatory TLR responses in the trophoblast.
