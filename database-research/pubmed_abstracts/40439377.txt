Sarcopenia is considered an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and performance status in head and neck cancer (HNC) receiving chemo-radiotherapy (CRT).
CRT is known to cause sleep disturbances, increased pain perception, depression leading to reduced quality of life (QOL).
Exercise-based rehabilitation has emerged as a promising strategy for improving outcomes in HNC.
Our study aimed to evaluate effect of exercise on sarcopenia and QOL in patients with HNC receiving CRT.
