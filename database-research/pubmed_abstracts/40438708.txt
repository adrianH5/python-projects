Gastric cancer is a serious human chronic disease.
The gastric signet ring cell carcinoma (GSRCC) is the most-dangerous subtype with several acute complications, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastric perforation, pyloric obstruction and so on.
This study aimed to compare the predictive efficiency of positive lymph nodes (PLN) and log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) for survival and to establish a LODDS-based nomogram model in stage III-IV GSRCC.
