Patients with node-positive breast cancer having primary surgery currently undergo axillary node clearance (ANC) to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence.
Evidence that this highly morbid procedure improves survival is lacking, but approximately 30% of patients will develop lifelong complications which significantly impact their quality of life.Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) may be a safe, less morbid alternative to ANC and will be evaluated in the upcoming Targeted Axillary Dissection versus axillary node clearance in patients with POsitive axillary Lymph nodes in Early breast cancer (TADPOLE) randomised controlled trial.TAD is not currently routine practice in patients having primary surgery, so it is vital that the procedure is performed in an agreed upon, standardised way within the trial and procedure fidelity monitored to ensure the results are generalisable and will be accepted by the surgical community.
Robust surgical quality assurance (SQA) is essential.
Here we describe the first phase of the TADPOLE SQA, a consensus process with the breast surgical community to agree upon how (1) surgery should be performed and standardised; (2) procedure fidelity will be monitored and (3) requirements for surgeon credentialling within the trial.
