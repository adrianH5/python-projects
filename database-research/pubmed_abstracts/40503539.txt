Nodal T-follicular helper cell lymphoma angioimmunoblastic type (nTFHL-AI) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm of mature T-follicular helper cells.
nTFHL-AI is characterized by polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, hemolytic anemia, circulating immune complexes, and cold agglutinins.
nTFHL-AI is also often associated with B-cell or plasma cell expansion, mimicking B-cell lymphomas or plasma cell neoplasms.
Therefore, the diagnosis of nTFHL-AI can sometimes be challenging and requires a specific immunophenotypic panel.
However, the peripheral blood involvement in nTFHL-AI seems rare and has not been frequently addressed in the literature.
We report the case of a 54-year-old man with multiple lymphadenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin rash, complaining of asthenia.
Peripheral blood smear showed plasmacytoid cells and red cell rouleaux.
A first flow cytometry screening panel of peripheral blood disclosed marked polyclonal plasmacytosis (12%).
No mature B lymphocytes were detectable.
In the suspicion of an nTFHL-AI, another flow cytometric panel was performed, including CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, and CD10.
The high-sensitivity flow cytometry analysis disclosed a small circulating population of atypical T cells (0.07%) expressing CD4
