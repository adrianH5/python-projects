Tumor cells reprogram their energy metabolism patterns to meet the needs of rapid growth and metastasis.
The underlying mechanisms of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in glucose metabolism remodeling in breast cancer (BC) are still not well understood.
Herein, the expression of a tumorigenic lncRNA, LINC01094 are demonstrated that, is significantly increased in BC tissues and is associated with poorer patient survival.
