The alternative splicing of mRNA precursors allows one gene to yield multiple proteins with distinct functions.
CDC-like kinases (CLKs) serve as pivotal regulators of alternative splicing.
Control of protein expression also occurs at the level of DNA through histone methylation and demethylation.
We investigated the activity of two CLK inhibitors, cirtuvivint and CC-671, and the LSD1 inhibitor iadademstat alone and in combination with anticancer drugs or investigational agents.
Well-characterized patient-derived cancer cell lines from the PDMR (https://pdmr.cancer.gov/models/database.htm) were used along with standard human cancer cell lines.
Multi-cell type (mct) tumor spheroids were grown from a ratio of 6:2.5:1.5 malignant cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells.
Following three days of growth, the spheroids were exposed to the single agents or combinations at concentrations up to the clinical C
