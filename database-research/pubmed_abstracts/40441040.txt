Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still has a high mortality rate and an increasing prevalence trend.
Therefore, improving treatment methods is essential for the management of this cancer.
Turmerones, which are the main volatile natural components of Curcuma longa Linn, have shown a number of beneficial biological activities both in vitro and in vivo.
However, because of their hydrophobicity, their delivery methods need substantial improvement.
Niosomes, which are made of non-ionic surfactants, have shown promising results in drug delivery systems (DDSs).
Due to their appropriate encapsulation rate, stability, bioavailability, and predictable release patterns, they could be useful tools in DDSs.
In this study, we demonstrated the benefit of treatment with turmerone-loaded niosomes on cancerous phenotypes of two HCC cell line in vitro and in vivo.
