Identification of the tissue of origin is fundamental for cancer treatment.
However, squamous cell carcinomas from different sites lack representative histological and immunohistochemical features.
This study aimed to identify mutational profiles and further establish a DNA methylation-based classification for squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.
Samples of unambiguous squamous cell carcinomas and urothelial carcinomas were collected for targeted next-generation sequencing and mutational landscape analysis.
Moreover, using Illumina methylation BeadChip data from public datasets and a local cohort, we developed a DNA methylation-based classifier utilizing the CatBoost algorithm to identify four common types of squamous cell carcinoma (lung, head and neck, esophagus, and cervix) as well as urothelial carcinoma.
