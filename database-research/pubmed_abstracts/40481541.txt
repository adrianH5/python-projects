Computed tomography (CT)-guided insertion of coil and suture hook-wire (SHW) insertion is commonly used for preoperative localization of multiple pulmonary nodules (PNs).
However, the relative clinical efficacy and safety of these two methods have not been established.
This study aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical performance and safety profiles of coil- and SHW-based localization techniques in patients with multiple PNs.
