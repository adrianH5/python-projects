Herein, we report the synthesis of (E)-2-(4-methoxybenzylidene) aminophenol (3a) and its mono/dihalo substituted aryl analogues (3b, 3c, and 3d), achieved by the condensation of 2-aminophenol derivatives with 4-methoxybenzaldehyde.
The structures of these Schiff bases were confirmed using a suite of spectroscopic and analytical techniques.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was used to determine the solid-state molecular conformation and intermolecular interactions that exist in the crystal packing of the resulting Schiff bases.
Interestingly, the presence of a meta-chloro substituent in 3b increases the dihedral angle when compared to 3a, suggesting that the molecular conformation is influenced by the acid dissociation constants (pK
