Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) can progress to ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (IBC) but over 75% of DCIS lesions do not progress if untreated.
Currently, DCIS that might progress to IBC cannot reliably be identified.
Therefore, most patients with DCIS undergo treatment resembling IBC.
To facilitate identification of low-risk DCIS, we developed deep learning models using histology whole-slide images (WSIs) and clinico-pathological data.
