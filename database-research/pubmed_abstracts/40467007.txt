Cancer diagnosis and treatment remains challenging, with unresolved issues such as low targeting, drug resistance, and numerous adverse reactions from chemotherapy.
Cell membrane biomimetic modified nanoparticles(CMBMNPs), wrapping cell membrane on nanoparticles can achieve homologous cell mimicry, so that it can obtain the functions and properties of the type of cell, with strong targeting ability, strong immune evasion ability, long in vivo circulation time, etc., which is getting more and more attention.
This article describes the preparation process of CMBMNPs and the different clinical effects of different types of nanoparticles and mimicking cell membranes in order to select the right match for use.
In addition, we list in detail several important features of CMBMNPs as well as the advantages of CMBMNPs in areas related to cancer diagnosis and therapy, and look forward to the future challenges and prospects of cell membrane-generating nanotechnology, which provides new insights into the application of CMBMNPs in cancer diagnosis and therapy.
