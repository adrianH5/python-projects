Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy, despite the progress in treatment, is still a challenge for both clinicians and affected patients.
Modern treatment regimens including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, CAR-T cell therapy as well as new generations of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors significantly improved clinical outcomes.
Nonetheless, there is still a room for improvement and novel therapeutic strategies.
IL-17-related signaling is a relatively undiscovered area in MM research.
It was established that IL-17 is the growth factor for plasma cells including their malignant counterparts, is associated with myelomagenesis and disease progression.
Furthermore, IL-17 axis can be pharmacologically targeted by monoclonal antibodies currently being used in different indications.
In this narrative review we summarized the role of IL-17 axis in MM.
Specifically, we focused on the role of IL-17 in MM development and progression with a particular emphasis upon clinical implications.
Moreover, we have briefly summarized the potential role of therapeutic interference with IL-17-related singling and have outlined future research directions.
