Low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) is a rare, indolent subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer that often arises from precursor lesions in the ovary or peritoneum and is associated with MAPK pathway mutations.
Unlike high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), which typically originates from cells in the fallopian tube, LGSC shows limited response to chemotherapy.
An isolated presentation in an extraperitoneal site, such as an inguinal lymph node, is exceedingly rare.
We present a case of primary nodal LGSC arising in the setting of endosalpingiosis.
