The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received over 700 botanical investigational new drug applications (INDs) in a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas since 1984.
The greatest numbers were for cancer management.
The aims of our study were to conduct a first-time, in-depth analysis of the regulatory submission profiles for botanical INDs with oncologic indications, in comparison with non-oncologic indications, and to share our regulatory review experience of oncologic botanical drug research and development.
