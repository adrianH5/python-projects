Globally, cancer will develop in one of every five people during their lifetime, impacting families in multiple ways.
Despite the long history of cancer registries, dating back to the early 20th century, they face persistent challenges, such as limited resources, insufficient data, governance failure, and operational inefficiency.
These challenges hinder effective cancer control and public health planning.
Overcoming them is crucial for improving management, enhancing policymaking, and providing more accurate statistics, thus enabling a clearer assessment of the cancer burden.
This study aimed to investigate the challenges faced by cancer registry programs and propose effective solutions to enhance their performance and accuracy.
