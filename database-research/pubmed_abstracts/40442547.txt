Fumarate hydratase (FH) is a key enzyme in the Krebs cycle and cellular energy metabolism, playing a crucial role in tumorigenesis.
It is considered a prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic target for many types of cancer.
Therefore, FH is a popular scientific subject in cancer research.
The current study aimed to identify cancer research in the WoS database and examine studies conducted on FH molecules using bibliometric indicators.
