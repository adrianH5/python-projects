Pituitary apoplexy is a rare but potentially life-threatening endocrine emergency characterized by acute hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland.
While often associated with pre-existing adenomas, it may also occur in previously normal glands.
Risk factors include surgery, pregnancy, and medications such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, which are rarely implicated in pituitary apoplexy.
We present the case of a 59-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prostate cancer who developed intractable headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and blurred vision shortly after receiving a leuprolide, GnRH agonist injection, for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Brain imaging revealed a sellar and suprasellar pituitary tumor with hemorrhage.
He was treated with intravenous fluids and steroids.
The patient underwent emergent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy surgery, and pathology confirmed a gonadotroph adenoma with necrosis.
The patient was discharged in stable condition.
Pituitary apoplexy following GnRH agonist therapy is exceedingly rare, with fewer than 30 cases reported in the public domain.
Proposed mechanisms include sudden cell shrinkage and metabolic hyperactivity within the pituitary gland.
This case underscores the importance of recognizing the clinical presentation of pituitary apoplexy, as timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preventing severe neurological and endocrine sequelae.
Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for pituitary apoplexy in patients presenting with acute neurological or endocrine symptoms following GnRH agonist therapy.
Increased awareness and vigilance in at-risk populations are essential, as routine pre-screening for pituitary adenomas is not currently standard practice.
