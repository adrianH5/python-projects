Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is standard of care for locally advanced Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Induction chemotherapy is given to reduce locoregional relapse, distant metastases and tumor shrinkage.
Response to induction chemotherapy can predict response to radiotherapy, but impact of IC response to survival benefit after radical treatment is less studied.
