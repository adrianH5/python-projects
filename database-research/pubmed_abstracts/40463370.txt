Succinylation, a key post-translational modification, plays a crucial role in metabolic regulation and tumor progression.
However, its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment and its prognostic implications remain unclear.
A systematic pan-cancer analysis of succinylation-related molecular activities is needed.
