The aim of this study was to screen the biomarkers of ginger against gastric cancer (GC) by network pharmacology, WGCNA and machine algorithms.
To find the upstream transcription factors and downstream signaling proteins constituting the signaling axis, so as to predict the possible mechanism of action of ginger against GC.
