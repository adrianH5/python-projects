Advanced thyroid cancer, including papillary (PTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), are the leading causes of endocrine cancer deaths.
Thus, there is a critical need to identify novel therapeutic targets to improve standard of care.
Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is overexpressed and phosphorylated in thyroid cancer and drives thyroid cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis.
FAK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is autophosphorylated at tyrosine 397 (Y397) in response to integrin or growth factor receptor signaling, resulting in the recruitment of SRC proto-oncogene and downstream signaling pathways.
FAK is predominately localized at the plasma membrane but has recently been shown to accumulate in the nucleus as well as the nucleolus to drive tumor growth.
The nucleolus is a membraneless subnuclear organelle that is involved in ribosomal biogenesis through the transcription, processing, and assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
The role of FAK in ribosome biogenesis is currently unknown.
