Primary cardiac angiosarcoma is a relatively rare tumor that frequently metastasizes by the time of diagnosis, with a poor prognosis.
Currently, there is no uniform treatment, with surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy being the mainstays of treatment.
We report the case of a man in his early 30s who presented to the emergency department with hemoptysis and was found to have massive pericardial effusion and right atrial occupancy upon investigation.
Subsequent examination revealed hypermetabolic foci in the lungs and femur, and a final biopsy confirmed the presence of a primary cardiac angiosarcoma.
The patient died 3 days after diagnosis due to cardiopulmonary failure, with a survival period of 4 months from symptom onset to death.
This report describes one of the few cases of cardiac tumor with respiratory symptoms.
