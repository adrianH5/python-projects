Understanding the mechanisms underlying mammalian regeneration may enable development of novel regenerative therapies.
We present a mechanism wherein Desert hedgehog (Dhh), secreted from epithelial neuroendocrine cells, elicits a regenerative/protective response from mesenchymal cells.
In mammalian airway, this mesenchymal response strikingly amplifies the initial signal from rare neuroendocrine cells to activate the entire tissue for survival and regeneration upon injury from SO
