AXL, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is over-expressed in many solid and hematologic cancers, promoting progression and poor clinical outcomes.
It also contributes to resistance against chemotherapeutic agents, especially tyrosine kinase inhibitors, by upregulating AXL signaling or switching oncogenic pathways.
These factors make AXL an attractive therapeutic target.
However, early attempts with naked antibody therapies failed due to the high doses need for efficacy, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting AXL were hindered by off-tumor toxicities due to its expression on normal tissues.
