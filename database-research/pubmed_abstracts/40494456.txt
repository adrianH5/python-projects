Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of numerous drugs in various disease therapies.
Recently, stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems have been employed to treat disease conditions, specifically cancer therapy.
Thermoresponsive drug delivery systems are most frequently applied for cancer treatment as these can be combined with hyperthermia or radiation therapy.
The tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are considered one of the difficult-to-treat cancers due to the limitation of the blood-brain barrier penetration.
Thermoresponsive solid lipid nanoparticles have the additional advantage of easy blood-brain penetration.
This review focuses on the potential application of thermoresponsive solid lipid nanoparticles in CNS tumor therapy.
This article summarizes various types of solid lipids that can be employed for thermoresponsive solid lipid nanoparticle formulation.
Moreover, the methods for preparing thermoresponsive solid lipid nanoparticles have been discussed here.
The mechanisms of drug release from the thermoresponsive solid lipid nanoparticles have also been explained in this article.
Overall, this article provides the readers with a more profound knowledge of thermoresponsive solid lipid nanoparticle formulations, emphasizing the research on these thermoresponsive solid lipid nanoparticles to establish their role in enhanced outcomes of CNS cancer therapy.
