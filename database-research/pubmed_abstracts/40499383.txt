In this work, a novel chemiluminescent semiconducting polymer nanoparticles PFBT-ABEI-PEG (PAP SPNs) has been designed and synthesized, which consisted of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PFBT) main chains, N-(4-Aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI) and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) side chains conjugated.
Through the exploration of covalent linkage and optimal conformation, the distance between donor-acceptor molecules has been considerably shortened, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET).
