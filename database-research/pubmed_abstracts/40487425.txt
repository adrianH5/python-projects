This independent crossover study assessed curcumin bioavailability and excretion in nine healthy males receiving three formulations (AOV, Longvida, and NovaSOL) at about 570 mg, while AOV was also tested at 2280 mg, with and without piperine.
Plasma levels of unconjugated curcumin remained below 2 nM in most cases, including high-dose AOV and piperine combinations.
NovaSOL achieved the highest levels (6.7-38 nM at 30 min), but these rapidly declined and were still 100-fold lower than concentrations used
