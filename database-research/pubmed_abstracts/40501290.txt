Organoid engineering is a rapidly expanding field that involves developing miniaturized, three-dimensional (3D) structures to mimic the architecture and function of real organs.
It provides a powerful platform to investigate organ development, disease modeling, and personalized medicine.
Recent advances in cell printing technology, also known as bioprinting, feature high-throughput potential, precise control, and enhanced reproducibility, enabling the deposition of living cells to generate complex, 3D biological structures.
Cell printing with bioinks composed of cells and supportive biomaterials has been utilized to generate
