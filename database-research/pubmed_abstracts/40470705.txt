Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer, often diagnosed at an advanced stage due to nonspecific symptoms and lack of effective screening.
Over 90% of all ovarian cancer cases are epithelial in origin, which is thought to originate from the fallopian tubes in approximately 70% of cases.
Opportunistic salpingectomy (OS), the additional removal of fallopian tubes during abdominal surgery, has emerged as a preventive strategy.
Despite growing evidence, the implementation of OS varies widely.
This study examines OS counseling and performance trends in the Netherlands from 2019 to 2022 and identifies associated patient, surgical, physician, and institutional characteristics.
