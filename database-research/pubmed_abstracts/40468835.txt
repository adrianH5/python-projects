The present study examines the quality of life (QoL) of transgender and gender-diverse individuals receiving versus not receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) in those assigned male at birth (AMAB) and assigned female at birth (AFAB).
It also explores the relationship between QoL and concentrations of oestradiol and testosterone.
