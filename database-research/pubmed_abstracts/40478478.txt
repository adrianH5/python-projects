Glycopolymer drug delivery nanosystems have attracted increasing attention in the field of sustainable biomaterials and clinical biomedicine, while few studies addressed their intracellular drug delivery properties, endocytosis pathways, intracellular trafficking, autophagy behaviors and the effect of autophagy inhibitors.
Based on our previous study, in this work, a pH-responsive glycopolymer (PMAgala
