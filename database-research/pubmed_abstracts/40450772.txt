In corona discharge-ion mobility spectrometry (CD-IMS), the distorted electric field generated by the discharge needle will penetrate into the reaction region of the IMS tube, forming an inhomogeneous electric field in this region.
Such inhomogeneous electric field is easy to make ions shift to the wall of the IMS tube during their traveling, which affects the trajectory and distribution of ions and reduces the detection performance of IMS.
In order to address the influence of this inhomogeneous electric field on the performance of IMS, we propose a novel method that mounts an isolating grid (IG) downstream of the discharge needle for isolating the inhomogeneous electric field.
A CD-IG-IMS was developed to measure the reactant ions to verify the isolation effect of the IG.
Theoretical simulation and experimental results show that such IG can effectively correct the migration of ions to the wall of the IMS tube and focus the ions on the axis of the IMS tube because it isolates the penetration of inhomogeneous electric field.
It is noteworthy that when the IG is positioned 2 mm downstream of the discharge needle, the ion intensity increases significantly, measuring 9.3 times greater than that observed in the absence of the IG.
When the IG is situated at 6 mm, the signal intensity of the reactant ions increases by 3.5 times, accompanied by a simultaneous 21 % enhancement in resolving power.
The results demonstrate that the existence of an inhomogeneous electric field within the ionization source region of IMS can be effectively isolated by the implementation of the IG.
This straightforward yet efficient design contributes to a marked enhancement in both the sensitivity and the resolving power of IMS.
