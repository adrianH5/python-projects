Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), the second most common primary liver malignancy, accounts for 3% of gastrointestinal cancers.
While surgical resection offers a five-year overall survival (OS) of 25-40%, only 12-30% of cases are resectable.
Advanced or metastatic iCCA often necessitates systemic therapy combined with loco-regional treatments such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
Despite its potential to improve local control (LC) and OS, the role of SBRT remains largely unexplored, particularly its integration with systemic therapy.
This study evaluates the role of SBRT, with a focus on its combination with systemic therapy, in enhancing LC and OS in advanced/metastatic iCCA.
