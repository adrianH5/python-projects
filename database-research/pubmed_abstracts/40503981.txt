Colloid carcinoma of the pancreas, also known as mucinous noncystic carcinoma, is an uncommon subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, accounting for only 1-3% of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms.
It is characterized histologically by abundant extracellular mucin pools containing floating neoplastic cells.
