Colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities in incidence and mortality for African Americans compared to white Americans are explained by socioeconomic, behavioral, biological, and cultural factors in addition to lower screening rates and lower stage-specific survival.
The behavioral clinical trial, "Test Up Now Education Program" (TUNE-UP) tested a community health advisor (CHA) intervention to increase stool-based screening in African American patients of community health centers (CHC) in Florida.
