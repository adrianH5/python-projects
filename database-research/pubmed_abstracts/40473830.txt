In our study, we determined the changes in the oxidative stress (OxS) biomarkers, thiol-disulfide (TD) homeostasis and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels, in patients diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma before and after chemotherapy.
We will examine the indirect effects of chemotherapy on OxS and antioxidant capacity by measuring changes in these blood biomarkers and compare the results with those of the healthy control group.
This case-control study, which was conducted in a single-center, prospective design, included 42 patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 51 healthy volunteers.
Venous blood samples were taken from all participants after 8 h of fasting, their serum was separated, and the serum total thiol, native thiol, disulfide, and IMA values were measured.
In the comparison of the blood samples taken before the chemotherapy treatment of the patient group with the healthy control group, the native thiol (p < 0.001), total thiol (p < 0.001), and native thiol/total thiol (p < 0.001) values were found to be statistically significantly lower, and the disulfide (p = 0.001), disulfide/native (p < 0.001), and disulfide/total thiol (p < 0.001) levels were found to be statistically significantly greater.
In the patient group diagnosed with ovarian cancer, a statistically significant difference was detected between the measurements of cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) (p < 0.001), native thiol (p = 0.019), and total thiol (p = 0.025) values at the 0th month before chemotherapy treatment and the third month after chemotherapy treatment.
In the group that received adjuvant chemotherapy after the operation, the native thiol (p = 0.035), total thiol (p = 0.043), disulfide/native thiol (p = 0.035), disulfide total thiol (p = 0.035), native thiol/total thiol (p = 0.035) and IMA (p = 0.026) values were statistically significantly different between the diagnosis and third-month values.
Our study suggests that TD homeostasis may be an important guide in terms of disease progression, complications during chemotherapy treatment, appropriate dose reductions, and modifications in chemotherapy depending on the toxicities experienced and the goals of the treatment.
