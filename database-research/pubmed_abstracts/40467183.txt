Atypical hyperplasia (AH) of the breast is a benign proliferative breast disorder that is associated with increased risk of a concurrent, associated breast cancer and an increased future risk of breast cancer.
It is often found on screening mammography and in approximately 10% of core needle biopsy specimens.
For women with AH, management could include excisional biopsy, enhanced breast cancer surveillance, and risk-reducing medications.
More in-depth characterization of AH has recently helped identify a lower risk cohort of women who may be able to avoid surgical intervention at the time of their AH diagnosis.
This review updates existing literature on the risk of AH, considerations for surgical excision, management strategies, and mitigation of future risk of breast cancer.
