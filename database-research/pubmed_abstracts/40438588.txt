Valproic acid (VPA) constitutes a branched-chain, short-chain fatty acid that serves as an antiepileptic medication.
It has been increasingly recognized that VPA has presented potential anti-tumor properties, including breast cancer.
However, the exploration of novel breast cancer treatment methods necessitates a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the novel mechanism of VPA inhibition of breast cancer.
It has been proven that farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) participate in oncogenesis and development of cancers.
However, the effect of FDFT1 on breast cancer is still obscure.
Thus, it is important to investigate the potential of VPA to trigger ferroptosis in breast cancer cells via targeting FDFT1.
