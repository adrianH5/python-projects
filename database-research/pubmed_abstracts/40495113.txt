Body mass index (BMI) and some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with IGF1 metabolism are risk factors for breast cancer (BC) in the general population.
No investigation has been performed in women presenting a familial predisposition to BC, except in women carrying a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2).
We investigated the effect of BMI and IGF1-related SNPs in high-risk women with no BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant.
