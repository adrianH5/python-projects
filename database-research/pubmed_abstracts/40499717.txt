For patients with locally advanced esophagogastric cancer, the standard of care in the UK is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by surgery.
Prehabilitation exercise training can improve physiological function and fitness.
If such improvements translate to increased immune infiltration of tumors, exercise could be prescribed as an immune adjuvant during NAC and potentially improve clinical outcomes.
As such, we aimed to determine whether prehabilitation increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
