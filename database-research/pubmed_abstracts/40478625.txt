Resistance to chemotherapy is a critical challenge in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
In this study, the proteomes of pretreatment core biopsy samples from 16 TNBC patients with differential response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS to identify biomarkers of intrinsic chemotherapy resistance.
This led to the identification of cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1) and 71 additional proteins as significantly more abundant in chemoresistant than chemosensitive TNBC.
Immunohistochemical analysis of 80 TNBC confirmed an association between elevated tumor cell CYP1B1 and residual cancer burden class 2/3 disease after NAC in T cell-excluded (TCE) TNBC (P <0.01), but not in T cell-infiltrated TNBC.
The frequency of complete pathologic response in TCE-TNBC with elevated CYP1B1 was 18% versus 56% in TCE-TNBC with low CYP1B1 and 75% in T cell-infiltrated TNBC.
Retrospective review of the chemotherapy regimens suggested that TCE-TNBC with elevated CYP1B1 were particularly resistant to doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.
This study is the first to associate resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC with elevated CYP1B1.
