In recent years, DNA methylation-tumor classification based on artificial intelligence algorithms has led to a notable improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional machine learning methods.
In cancer, the methylation pattern likely reflects both the cell of origin and somatically acquired DNA methylation changes, making this epigenetic modification an ideal tool for tumor classification.
We propose an in-depth method based on the Convolutional Neural Network for the DNA methylation-based classification of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and its follicular (fvPTC) and classical (cvPTC) subtypes.
