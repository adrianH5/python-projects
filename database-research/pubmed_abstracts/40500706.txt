Malignancies of the liver and bile ducts are associated with high recurrence rates after surgery and poor prognosis when disseminated.
Medical treatment has been improved in recent years, with chemotherapy, targeted therapy and checkpoint inhibitors offering opportunities to influence the course of the diseases.
Many patients do not benefit from treatment, however, and predictive and prognostic markers are lacking.
The BILe duct and LIver cancer: ON-treatment Surveillance of Tumor evolution And Response to Systemic treatment (BILLIONSTARS) study aims to map how molecular tumor characteristics and pathways of genetic evolution align with treatment response trajectories.
