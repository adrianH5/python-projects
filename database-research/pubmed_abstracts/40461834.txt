Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) is associated with a lengthy hospital stay, risk of additional complications and substantial costs.
Data regarding the incidence of PPOI following right extended colectomy (REC) with ileo-descending anastomosis is limited.
This study aimed to compare the incidence of PPOI and evaluate risk factors for this condition among patients undergoing REC, left hemicolectomy (LC), and right hemicolectomy (RC) for colon carcinoma.
