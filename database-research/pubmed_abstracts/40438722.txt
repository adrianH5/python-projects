Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) remains a significant clinical challenge with a 30-day mortality of up to 11%.
Peptic ulcers are the most common cause, followed by other conditions like Mallory-Weiss syndrome, Dieulafoy's lesions, and gastric neoplasms.
Treatment strategies include acid-suppressive therapy, endoscopic interventions, and surgical or radiological procedures.
Endoscopic techniques such as over-the-scope clips, coagulation graspers, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatments have significantly improved outcomes, reducing rebleeding rates and the need for surgery.
