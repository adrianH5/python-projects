Dobutamine hydrochloride (DH), a common inotropic drug used for heart failure, has recently been discovered to inhibit Yes-Associated Protein (YAP).
YAP is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway and plays a crucial role in the regulation of hematopoietic cell growth.
The decrease in YAP activity has been shown to increase hematogenic differentiation and the generation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).
Therefore, this study investigates the effect of DH on enhancing the hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs toward HSPCs.
