Tarlatamab, a bispecific delta-like ligand 3-directed T-cell engager immunotherapy, received accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with previously treated small-cell lung cancer.
Whether tarlatamab is more effective than chemotherapy in the treatment of patients whose small-cell lung cancer has progressed during or after initial platinum-based chemotherapy is not known.
