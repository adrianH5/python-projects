Bone repair and tissue engineering require biomaterials that offer both mechanical stability and biocompatibility.
Titanium is renowned for its mechanical durability but has limited bioactivity, whereas magnesium offers high bioactivity but degrades too quickly.
This study develops a novel hybrid scaffold using fused filament fabrication (FFF) to combine polylactic acid (PLA) with magnesium titanate (MgTiO
