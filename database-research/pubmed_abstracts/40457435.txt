Progenitor endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) are critical for vascular homeostasis and hold therapeutic potential for ischaemic cardiovascular disease (CVD).
As angiogenic capacity and efficacy within diseased tissues is particularly impacted in diabetic patients, who show high incidence of ischaemic CVD, targeting of critical ECFC pathways in this setting represents an innovative focus towards enhancing intrinsic vasoreparative function.
We previously reported that NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)-derived reactive oxygen species promote cord blood-derived ECFC (CB-ECFC) pro-angiogenic response, whilst NOX4 overexpression (OE) enhances revascularisation capacity.
Here, we aimed to investigate specific influence of NOX4-dependent signalling on CB-ECFC angiogenic dysfunction observed upon exposure to both experimental and clinical diabetes to define whether NOX4 may represent a viable therapeutic target in this context.
