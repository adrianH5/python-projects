Disulfidptosis, a recently identified mechanism of cell death characterized by intracellular sulfide accumulation, leading to cellular exhaustion.
Our objective is to create a prognostic model using a cohort of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) to assess their prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
This research not only deepens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning LUAD but also offers promising avenues for new clinical treatment biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
