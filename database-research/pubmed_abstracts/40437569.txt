The moral panic surrounding trans, non-binary, and gender diverse (TGD) lives in the United Kingdom (UK) has been incited by high-level political and government actors and exacerbated by pervasive misinformation in social and press media.
This hostile environment contributes to increasing interpersonal violence and social exclusion experienced by TGD people.
Structural and interpersonal discrimination—conceptualised as minority stress—is understood to elicit physiological and psychological stress responses that predispose TGD individuals to a range of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, and risk behaviours such as alcohol use.
