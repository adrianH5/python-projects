Marine-derived polysaccharides have garnered considerable attention in recent years owing to their distinctive molecular architectures and a broad spectrum of biological activities.
The structural complexity of these polysaccharides encompasses not only their primary structure but also higher-order conformations, including secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.
Cutting-edge analytical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), mass spectrometry (MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enable comprehensive characterization of these polysaccharides, focusing on parameters like molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, and glycosidic linkage types.
Such analytical methodologies provide deep insights into the structural intricacies of polysaccharides, elucidating their correlations with biological activities and laying a solid foundation for their potential in drug delivery systems, antioxidant therapies, and anticancer applications.
