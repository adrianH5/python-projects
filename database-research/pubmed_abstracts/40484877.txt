Masses are commonly detected in the kidneys either as incidental findings or upon workup of urinary symptoms on an initial presentation.
We describe a large series of rare cases in which individuals presented with symptoms or imaging findings of kidney masses concerning for primary carcinoma of renal cell or urothelial origin but were found on pathological analysis to be lymphomas or atypical lymphoid proliferations, with or without an accompanying renal malignancy.
These mass lesions, including some unique mimics of renal carcinomas such as reactive follicular hyperplasia and IgG4-related disease primary to the kidney, are all lymphoid kidney proliferations from a single institution.
Herein, we demonstrate the need for consideration of lymphoid abnormalities in the diagnosis of renal masses, which can affect further workup and management.
We also review the differential diagnosis of primary renal masses originating from neoplastic and non-neoplastic lymphoid disorders.
