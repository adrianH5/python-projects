The CXCL10-CXCR3 axis regulates immunity, tumorigenesis, and metastasis in multiple cancers.
Yet, its roles in osteosarcoma (OS), the predominant pediatric malignant bone tumor, are not fully defined.
Our prior work has shown that elevated serum CXCL10 levels correlate with poor OS prognosis.
The current study delves deeper by investigating how CXCL10-mediated CXCR3 signaling influences OS growth and metastatic spread.
