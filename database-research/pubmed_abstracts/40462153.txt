This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pelvic radiation therapy (RT) on the occurrence of severe radiation-induced lymphopenia (SRIL) and identify its clinical and dosimetric predictors using voxel-wise analysis.
Understanding these impacts is crucial for improving patient outcomes and optimizing treatment protocols in radiation oncology.
