Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, has been robustly linked to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
The mechanism of EBV-induced NPC involves complex interactions between viral proteins and host cell pathways.
This review aims to comprehensively outline the mechanism of EBV-induced NPC and the latest advances in targeted EBV vaccines for prophylaxis and treatment.
This review explores the intricate molecular mechanisms by which EBV contributes to NPC pathogenesis, highlighting viral latency, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and immune evasion strategies.
It emphasizes the pivotal role of key viral proteins, including EBNA1, LMP1, and LMP2A, in carcinogenesis.
Subsequently, the discussion shifts towards the development of targeted EBV vaccines, including preventive vaccines aimed at preventing primary EBV infection and therapeutic vaccines aimed at treating diagnosed EBV-related NPC.
The review underscores the challenges and future directions in the field, stressing the importance of developing innovative vaccine strategies and combination therapies to improve efficacy.
This review synthesizes current insights into the molecular mechanisms of EBV-induced NPC and the development of EBV-targeted vaccines, highlighting the potential use of mRNA vaccines for NPC treatment.
