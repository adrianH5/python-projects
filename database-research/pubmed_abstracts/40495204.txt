Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in intercellular communication.
While the effects of EVs released from living or non-dying cancer cells are well characterized, the impact of EVs released from chemotherapy-treated or apoptotic cancer cells is less understood.
This study investigated the effects of the chemotherapy agent cisplatin on EV release and miRNA content in apoptotic medulloblastoma cells, as well as their influence on the growth of drug-na√Øve recipient cancer cells.
