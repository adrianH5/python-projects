Breast cancer (BC) is the second most prevalent cancer among women in sub-Saharan Africa.
Despite dedicated efforts to enhance BC care in the region through improving diagnostic and treatment services, little is known about the treatment outcomes of BC patients and the predictors of outcomes in our local settings have not been enumerated.
This study aimed to investigate the treatment outcomes and the associated factors among BC patients in Tanzania.
