The patient was a 54-year-old woman with chronic myeloid leukemia.
Ten months after treatment with dasatinib, she developed a cough.
Imaging studies showed ground-glass patterns in the lower lung fields of both lungs, which led to suspicion of drug-induced lung injury and prompted discontinuation of dasatinib.
A transbronchial lung biopsy showed epithelioid granuloma without necrosis in the alveolar region.
There were no other systemic symptoms or signs to support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
Fifteen days after withdrawal of dasatinib, both the cough and X-ray findings improved.
Granulomatous tissue was detected on lung biopsy, which indicates that drug-induced sarcoidosis-like reaction (DISR) may cause interstitial lung injury as a respiratory complication of dasatinib treatment.
Case reports of DISR following administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs have recently become more frequent.
Here we report a case of dasatinib-induced DISR with a review of the literature.
