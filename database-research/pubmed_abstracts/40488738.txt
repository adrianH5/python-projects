Bone pasteurization, which treats resected bone at high temperatures to eradicate malignant cells, is an option for preparing an autogenous bone graft for the reconstruction of a bone defect during the resection of malignancies.
The authors here report 2 cases that received mandibular bone reconstruction and occipital bone reconstruction with a pasteurized bone (PB) graft.
Patient 1: a patient with oral floor cancer underwent tumor resection and immediate reconstruction using a pasteurized mandibular bone covered with a free rectus abdominis flap.
Patient 2: a patient with synovial sarcoma of the head received tumor resection followed by reconstruction using a pasteurized occipital bone covered by a trapezius musculocutaneous flap.
Postoperative recurrence was not evident in both patients, and functional and esthetic outcomes were favorable.
The pasteurization method may provide a feasible option for the reconstruction of the craniomaxillofacial region when the patient's condition does not allow the sacrifice of donor bone and cost.
