The field of urological tumor histopathology has long relied on subjective pathologist expertise, leading to diagnostic variability.
Recent advances in digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) offer transformative potential by standardizing diagnoses, improving accuracy, and bridging healthcare disparities.
This study conducted a 20-year bibliometric analysis to map global research trends and innovations in AI-driven urological pathology.
