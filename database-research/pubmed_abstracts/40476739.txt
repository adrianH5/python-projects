Middle-aged and older adults (ages 45+) have historically been overlooked in tobacco research and policy despite a quit rate half that of younger adults and the greatest near-term harms of tobacco use.
A scoping review was conducted on smoking cessation treatment efficacy and its impact on health outcomes among middle-aged and older adults who smoke.
This review was reported in accordance with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews.
