Accurate Gleason score (GS)/International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group (GG) assessment in prostate cancer (PCa) is crucial for risk stratification and treatment.
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and targeted biopsies (TPBx) have enhanced PCa detection, but their accuracy compared to systematic biopsies (SPBx) is under discussion.
This study investigates GS/GG concordance between prostate biopsies (TPBx and SPBx) and radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, evaluating rates and factors associated with GS/GG upgrading and downgrading.
