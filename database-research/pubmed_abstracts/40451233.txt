Testicular cancer is the most common solid malignancy in people with testicles aged 15-44 years, accounting for 1-2% of all tumours in males of all ages.
Approximately 95% of testicular cancers are testicular germ cell tumours.
This Seminar focuses on testicular cancer, with an emphasis on testicular germ cell tumours.
We delve into the epidemiology, clinical presentation, disease management, controversies, clinical dilemmas, follow-up, and future directions.
Furthermore, we explore distinct treatment approaches for seminoma and non-seminoma testicular germ cell tumours across all clinical stages and discuss post-treatment salvage options after relapse.
Our Seminar aims to provide a comprehensive review of testicular cancer, to enhance understanding, and inform clinicians and researchers about the latest developments in management.
