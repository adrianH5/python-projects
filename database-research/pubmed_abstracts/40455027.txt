Kimura technique is a common variant of spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy and preferable for patients with benign pancreatic lesions.

Preoperative imaging revealed fusion of neoplasm with splenic artery and vein within a short segment.
This prepared surgeons for potential laparoscopic vascular suture.
