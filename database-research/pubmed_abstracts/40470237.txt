Tobacco use among the youth in Uganda remains higher than general national estimates.
To tackle this challenge, the Centre for Tobacco Control in Africa and the World Health Organization assert a need for current data and tobacco use monitoring with emphasis on most at-risk populations.
In Uganda, routine monitoring is done through quinquennials; Uganda Demographic Health Survey , World Health Organisation stepwise surveys, Global Adult Tobacco Survey and Global Youth Tobacco Survey.
Although recent assessments reported tobacco use among the general population, current data is scarce among the youth in informal settlements.
We sought to assess the patterns of tobacco use and associated factors among the youth in informal settlements, with focus on daily tobacco smoking and smokeless tobacco use.
