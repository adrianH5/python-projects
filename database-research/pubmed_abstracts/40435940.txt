High-fat diets (HFD) are known to affect the gut microbiome structure and potentially promote the development and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC).
This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which gut microbiome dysbiosis, mediated by the propionate/GPR41 signaling pathway, promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymph node (LN) metastasis in CRC, providing new insights for CRC treatment.
