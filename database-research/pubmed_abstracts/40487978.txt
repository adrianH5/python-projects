Rotator cuff injuries represent a prevalent cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction, significantly impacting the quality of life.
Surgical repair has the potential to restore tendon integrity, alleviate symptoms, and enhance overall function.
However, the limited self-healing capacity of tendons, the propensity for fragile scar tissue formation, and the risk of tendons retear necessitate the exploration of alternative approaches.
Stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising and effective strategy for the regenerative repair of rotator cuff injuries.
This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of this field to explore the current state of research and identify emerging focus areas.
