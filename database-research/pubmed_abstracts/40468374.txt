Detection of DNA methylation biomarkers in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has great clinical potential for cancer management, but there is a high need for method optimization and standardization.
Bisulfite conversion of DNA is the gold-standard pre-treatment method for DNA methylation analyses, but causes also DNA fragmentation and loss.
Enzymatic conversion of DNA represents a promising alternative due to the more gentle treatment minimizing damage to DNA.
The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare enzymatic and bisulfite conversion to identify the best pre-treatment method for detecting DNA methylation biomarkers in cfDNA from plasma using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).
