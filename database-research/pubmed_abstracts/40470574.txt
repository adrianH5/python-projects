Albumin and creatinine are considered important for understanding patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
However, numerous confounding factors complicate the interpretation of albumin and creatinine alone in clinical practice.
This study aims to assess the correlation between survival outcomes and serum-albumin creatinine ratio (sACR) in patients treated with ICIs.
