There is significant concern regarding the inventory of pollutants, with a particular focus on understanding the major sources of emissions and their impact on human health.
The study investigated the indoor air quality of pollutants to which workers were exposed during different painting processes, including those employed in the automotive industry and those engaged in artistic painting.
Sampling was conducted using Tenax-TA in one painting class and two printmaking classes at the Faculty of Fine Arts and Faculty of Education in Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal University, as well as in a car painting repair shop in the city center of Bolu.
A total of 58 volatile organic compounds were identified using TD-GC-MS.
The study also investigated the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects on workers of five-trimethylbenzene, benzaldehyde, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, phenol, acetophenone, naphthalene and biogenic VOCs like crotonaldehyde and d-limonene.
The lifetime cancer risk of carbon tetrachloride, benzene and 1,2-dichloroethane, benzaldehyde was found to range from 5.17 × 10
