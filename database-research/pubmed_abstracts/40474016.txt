Cancer patients are most often accompanied by at least one caregiver along the oncological care path.
Since cancer has been defined as a "family disease", patients may rely on caregivers to take medical decisions.
In some cases, they arrive at shared decisions, and in other cases, they experience some conflict, with negative implications on the care process.
No systematic collection of "moral conflicts", i.e., conflicts pertaining to ethically related issues, occurring among patients and their caregivers in cancer care path is available in current bioethics literature.
