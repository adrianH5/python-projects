Onivyde, a liposome-encapsulated irinotecan, is used for advanced pancreatic, while TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil) is indicated for metastatic colorectal and gastric cancers.
This study aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and safety profiles of liposomal irinotecan combined with TAS-102.
This multicenter, phase I study utilized a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design.
Patients with treatment-refractory solid malignancies received free base liposomal irinotecan at 50-70 mg/m
