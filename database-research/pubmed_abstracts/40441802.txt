The randomized phase III DESTINY-Breast06 trial (NCT04494425) demonstrated superior efficacy with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) versus chemotherapy treatment of physician's choice (TPC) and no new safety signals in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+, IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-negative], and HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) metastatic breast cancer (mBC).
Here, we report the patient-reported outcome (PRO) endpoints in the intent-to-treat (ITT; HER2-low/-ultralow) and HER2-low populations.
