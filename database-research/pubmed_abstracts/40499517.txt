Somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells can lead to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a frequent condition associated with many age-related diseases including solid cancer.
In the New England Journal of Medicine, Pich et al.
report that tumor-infiltrating CHIP correlates with worsened cancer prognosis and clinical outcomes, providing evidence for the impact of mutated immune cells on disease progression.
