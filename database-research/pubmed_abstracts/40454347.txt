Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a pivotal mitochondrial deacetylase, plays a critical role in restoring mitochondrial function, particularly through the activation of autophagy.
Despite its promise as a cardioprotective target, developing SIRT3 activators and their therapeutic applications remains challenging.
Here, we report the identification of
