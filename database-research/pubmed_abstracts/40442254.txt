This study investigates the effect of amine functional groups in ZIF-8 metal-organic frameworks on the loading and release of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
The facile and cost-effective solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE) method was used to exchange 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) linkers with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Atz) in the ZIF-8 structure, which resulted in a synthesis of ZIF-8A with 22, 53, and 74% Atz exchange, respectively.
The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by
