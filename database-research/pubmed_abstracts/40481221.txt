Pharmacological treatment of malignant tumors in obese patients has been reported from several perspectives.
Physiological changes may affect the kinetics of anticancer drugs (e.g., lipophilicity, distribution volume, and metabolism), consequently affecting their efficacy and safety profile.
However, specific guidelines for antineoplastic agent dose adjustment according to body weight, mainly due to the under-representation of obese patients in clinical trials, are currently lacking.
Moreover, considering that certain tumor development is associated with obesity, the clinical management of obese patients is often complex.
We herein report the antitumor treatment options of three obese patients with malignant tumors and review relevant literature to analyze the dosage of antitumor drugs in this setting.
This study aims to provide additional data for the clinical treatment of obese patients with malignant tumors.
