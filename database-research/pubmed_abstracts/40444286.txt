Colon cancer screening studies are needed for the early detection of colorectal polyps to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
Unfortunately, the data generated on colon polyps are typically analyzed in their dichotomized form and sometimes with standard count models, which leads to potentially inaccurate findings in research studies.
A more appropriate approach for evaluating colon polyps is zero-inflated models, considering undetected existing polyps at colonoscopy screening.
