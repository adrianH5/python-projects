Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), a class I PI3K family member, plays a critical role in modulating inflammation and immune responses within the tumour microenvironment.
Emerging evidence suggests that PI3Kγ promotes myeloid cell trafficking and transcription, leading to tumour progression and metastasis.
This review explores the multifaceted roles of PI3Kγ in tumour-associated inflammation, highlighting its involvement in immune cell polarisation, cytokine production, and the dynamic interaction between tumour cells and the surrounding stromal environment.
We also discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting PI3Kγ to modulate inflammation and inhibit tumour growth.
Given its pivotal role in immune response and tumour progression, PI3Kγ represents a promising target for future cancer therapies to reduce inflammation-driven tumorigenesis.
