Glioma, a primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system, remains a formidable challenge despite advancements in treatment.
Immunotherapies hold promise, but their efficacy is hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).
The nose-to-brain transport pathway offers a potential solution for bypassing the BBB and avoiding systemic absorption issues.
In this study, we developed a calcium phosphate (CaP)-covered nanovaccine (NV) based on hepatitis B core antigen derived virus-like particles (HBc VLPs), optimized for mucosal delivery applications.
After biomineralization, this NVs exhibited enhanced mucosal adhesion and significantly higher accumulation in glioma tissue.
Furthermore, by leveraging the immunogenicity of HBc VLPs and displaying a glioma-associated antigen EphA2
