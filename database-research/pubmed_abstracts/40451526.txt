Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising cancer therapeutic candidate because it induces apoptosis preferentially in malignant cells.
However, intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms severely limit its clinical efficacy.
This review highlights strategies to overcome TRAIL resistance, mainly using natural compounds, engineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and nanoparticle-based delivery systems.
Natural products such as polyphenols, alkaloids, and terpenoids could enhance the sensitivity of TRIAL-resistant cancer cells by modulating the apoptosis-evasion-related major signal pathways.
The engineered use of MSCs, which are genetically modified to express membrane-bound or secreted TRAIL, represents a novel targeted delivery strategy to improve the local concentrations of TRAIL by using the tumor-homing properties of MSCs.
MSCs-TRAIL can be used in conjunction with, and may synergize with, other cancer treatments, making it an attractive option.
Moreover, nanoparticle-mediated delivery represents excellent capacity to improve the pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs, increase tumor penetration, and enable adjustable release, thus addressing drawbacks linked with systemic administration and rapid degradation.
Crucially, local TRAIL delivery can bypass the limitations of systemic administration, which include rapid degradation and off-target effects.
Herein, we first glimpse the various molecular pathways and cellular processes contributing to TRAIL resistance in cancer cells.
Then, we delve into current knowledge of these strategies and their potential to boost TRAIL-based cancer therapy, tackle TRAIL resistance, and lead to better cancer therapies for patients.
