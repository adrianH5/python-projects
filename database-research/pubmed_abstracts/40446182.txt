Cellular therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), have revolutionized the treatment of various B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
A number of agents are now approved by regulatory agencies for treatment of large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, and more agents are currently under review.
Notably, while the current approvals are for single agents in the relapsed/refractory setting, clinical trials are now investigating combination approaches as well as incorporating cellular therapies and BsAbs into earlier lines of treatment.
This article focuses on cellular therapies and BsAbs for treatment of various lymphomas, including review of completed or ongoing trials of using these platforms in earlier lines which have the potential to be practice changing in the near future.
