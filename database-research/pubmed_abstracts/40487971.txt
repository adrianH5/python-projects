Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a heterogeneous group of aggressive malignancies arising from the biliary tree.
Epidemiological data show an increase in the incidence of intrahepatic CCA in Western countries and a stable or decrease in the incidence of extrahepatic CCA.
There are conflicting results in literature regarding the trend of the incidence of gallbladder cancer.
However, most studies refer to a time period before 2000.
