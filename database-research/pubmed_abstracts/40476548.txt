Whole-cell cancer vaccines can trigger broader-spectrum antitumoral immune responses.
However, a lack of immunogenicity and unclear interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) hinder their translation into effective personalized immunotherapies.
Herein, tumor cells are engineered via layer-by-layer bimineralization integrating sequential silicification and manganese mineralization, which reprograms the APC recognition with high immunogenicity.
These bacteria-mimicking cells with enhanced mechanical stiffness protect against antigen degradation and facilitate phagocytosis by APCs.
The secondary Mn mineralization creates spiky-like MnO
