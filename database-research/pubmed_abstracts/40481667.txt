Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes 85%-90% of lung cancer (LC) cases, is among the most frequently diagnosed malignancies.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α (PPARGC1A, also known as PGC-1α) emerges as a major modulator of mitochondrial formation and energy expenditure and serves critical functions in a range of malignancies.
Nevertheless, its clinicopathological significance and biological function in the development of NSCLC remain obscure.
This investigation revealed that PGC-1α expression exhibited elevated levels in LC.
Moreover, enhanced PGC-1α expression augmented the oncogenic potential of NSCLC cells, whereas the downregulation of PGC-1α inhibited the proliferative and migrative capability and suppressed tumor growth
