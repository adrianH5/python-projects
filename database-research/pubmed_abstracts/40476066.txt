While known sex differences in bone health exist, scientific studies on bone degeneration and regeneration frequently disregard sex impact as a variable in outcomes.
Evidence has established a higher risk of osteoporosis and increased bone degradation rates in women when compared to men.
Accumulating research suggests that this disparity is also present in bone regeneration and repair.
However, no comprehensive review highlighting the influence of sex currently exists in this field.
This paper aims to review the information presently available on the cellular mechanisms behind skeletal sexual dimorphism specific to hormones and bone's degenerative and regenerative sex differences.
This review will discuss the optimization of personalized regenerative therapies accounting for sex.
The review emphasizes that sex impact must further be investigated to advance the field of bone regeneration and improve patient outcomes and quality of life.
As translational medicine is JOT's focus, authors must highlight the translational potential or clinical significance of their work in both the abstract and the discussion.
To this effect, it is required to include a statement following the abstract (included in the abstract word count) under the following heading: "The Translational Potential of this Article".
