Tissue-agnostic cancer therapies promise to revolutionize oncology by targeting molecular drivers.
Sledge et al.â€™s study of nearly 300,000 tumors found 21.5% with tissue-agnostic indications.
Despite nine FDA approvals, real-world implementation challenges persist.
Progress depends on universal genomic testing, an oncogenomic-savvy workforce, innovative trials, updated regulations, and real-world evidence to maximize potential.
