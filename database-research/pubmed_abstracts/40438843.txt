We report a case of thyroid lipoadenoma of the thyroid gland, an extremely rare benign lesion containing both adipose tissue and thyroid tissue.
A 74-year-old Chinese female underwent a series of examinations for the incidental thyroid nodule.
The sonogram showed a well-encapsulated and hyper-isoechoic nodule in the left thyroid gland.
The CT revealed a low-attenuation thyroid nodule without evidence of extrathyroid extension.
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology reported atypia of undetermined significance.
As none of these studies could confirm the diagnosis and rule out potential malignancy, the patient ultimately received minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT).
Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of thyroid lipoadenoma, consisting of adipose tissue and follicular cells, with adipose tissue comprising approximately 40% to 50% of the lesion.
Common diagnostic tools for thyroid nodules offer limited utility in identifying thyroid lipoadenoma, often requiring thyroidectomy for definitive diagnosis and management.
