Over the past decade, there has been a qualitative improvement in the understanding of gut microbiota in cancer development and treatment.
Gut microbiota regulates metabolic reprogramming that occurs in the competition between tumor cells and immune cells for essential nutrients in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Besides, gut microbiota dysbiosis is one of the key factors leading to the formation of aging environment, which has many similarities with theÂ TME.
Accumulating research findings have demonstrated that gut microbiota enhances the efficacy of cancer therapies by activating the immune system and facilitating the biotransformation of drugs.
Other studies also have shown that specific microbial composition is the effective biomarker of drug resistance and toxicity for cancer treatment.
Microbiota-directed therapies are being explored intensively for their potential in cancer prevention and treatment.
In this review, we summarize the role of gut microbiota in metabolic reprogramming and immune remodeling; provide an overview of the relationship between gut microbiota and the efficacy, resistance, and toxicity of cancer treatment; propose a series of strategies to integrate gut microbiota into cancer treatment, optimizing antitumor effectiveness and reducing side effects.
