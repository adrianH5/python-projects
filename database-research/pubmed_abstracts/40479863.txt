Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is an antibody-drug conjugate associated with clinically meaningful responses as advanced-line treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC).
Practically, SG has been most commonly used in the post-enfortumab vedotin (EV) setting, but data are scarce regarding the efficacy in this population, including the negative phase III study that enrolled mostly EV-naive patients.
