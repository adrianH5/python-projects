Although decitabine (DAC) shows activity against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), patient responses are limited, and prognoses remain poor.
Preclinical studies have indicated that arsenic trioxide (ATO) and carboplatin (Carbo) enhance DAC's epigenetic gene derepression.
Consequently, we initiated a randomized phase 2 clinical trial evaluating DAC alone, or with Carbo or ATO, in patients with MDS/AML.
Thirty patients were initially randomized to receive DAC alone (20 mg/m
