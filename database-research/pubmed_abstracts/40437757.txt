Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is a prevalent mode of metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) with rapid disease progression and limited treatment options.
Locoregional infusion of immune cells have been explored in different types of solid tumors, but the feasibility and safety of locoregional chimeric antigen receptor-natural killer (CAR-NK) cells in treating CRC-PM is still unknown.
We report the results of a phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial (NCT05213195) using intraperitoneal infusion of NKG2D CAR-NK cells in heavily-pretreated patients with CRC-PM, and the immune-modulatory effect of CAR-NK cells was also illustrated using multi-omics analysis and functional validation.
Locoregional NKG2D CAR-NK cell therapy showed preliminary efficacy and tolerable toxicity in this study.
Of nine patients, three achieved stable disease, and the disease control rate was 33.3%.
