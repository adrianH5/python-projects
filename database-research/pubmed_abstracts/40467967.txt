Exercise following cancer treatment has been shown to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and other important health outcomes, yet barriers to participation prevent many cancer survivors from exercising according to recommendations.
Live-remote exercise methods could improve accessibility; however, evidence on their efficacy is limited.
The EX-MED Cancer Sweden randomised controlled trial compared the effects of a 12-week live-remote online exercise intervention to usual care in adult cancer survivors.
