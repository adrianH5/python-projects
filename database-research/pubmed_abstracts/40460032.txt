Drug combination therapy is an effective strategy for cancer treatment, enhancing drug efficacy and reducing toxic side effects.
However, in vitro drug screening experiments are time-consuming and expensive, necessitating the development of computational methods for drug synergy prediction.
While current methods focus on molecular chemical structures, they often overlook the biological context, limiting their ability to capture complex drug synergies.
