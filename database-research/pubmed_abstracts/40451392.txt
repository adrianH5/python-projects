Gynecological cancers are cancers that begin in the female reproductive organs.
Gynecological cancer is the second most common cancer type among women and has become a global health burden for the female population.
More than 50Â % of all gynecological cancers can be defined as rare cancers.
Three main types of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), namely, microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play crucial regulatory roles in physiological and pathological processes.
Increasing evidence has revealed that ncRNAs closely participate in gynecological cancers.
In this review, we focus on the role of ncRNAs in rare gynecological cancers.
We first introduce the definitions, classifications, epidemiological characteristics, prognoses and treatments of rare gynecological cancers.
Next, we summarize the differentially expressed ncRNAs and the molecular mechanisms underlying ncRNA connections to tumorigenesis, metastasis, chemoresistance, and recurrence.
Finally, we highlight the potential applications of ncRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
