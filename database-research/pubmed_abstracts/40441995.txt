Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) represent a diverse group of tumors originating from neuroendocrine cells, characterized by their unique biological behavior and clinical manifestations.
The incidence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) has been rising, necessitating effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
Molecular imaging, particularly through techniques such as PET and SPECT, plays a pivotal role in the management of NETs.
This review highlights the significance of somatostatin receptor imaging in the initial diagnostic work-up, staging, and treatment planning for NETs, emphasizing the utility of radiopharmaceuticals like [
