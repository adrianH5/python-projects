Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a lifelong infection, often acquired in childhood and persisting throughout life, that can lead to serious gastric diseases, including gastric cancer in adults.
While asymptomatic in most children, it may cause extraintestinal manifestations affecting growth, necessitating distinct pediatric management strategies-particularly in countries with a high risk of gastric cancer.
Accurate diagnosis is critical in high-risk populations.
The stool antigen test is a reliable, non-invasive method for young children.
Despite Bhutan's high H. pylori burden, diagnostic tools remain scarce.
This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of H. pylori infection in Bhutanese children and validate a new in-house immunochromatography test (the A-ICT) kits.
