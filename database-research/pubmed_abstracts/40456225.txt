Since treatment of patients with head and neck cancer is often challenging due to adverse events and especially severe adverse events, continuous efforts are required optimize patients' health status before therapy in order to achieve as little toxicity as possible, while providing the same therapeutic standards especially for elderly individuals, who statistically represent the largest group of patients with head and neck cancer.
Modern prehabilitation concepts, that primarily aim at optimizing the nutritional status of patients before beginning of treatment and during treatment, appear to be of particular interest in order to adequately meet this challenge.
In this context, both poor nutritional status and frailty have been established as well known risk factors and predictors of poor outcome in patients with head and neck cancer.
Assessment of the nutritional status, pretherapeutic evaluation of frailty and the associated potential optimization of the patient's general health status is barely implemented in German head and neck cancer centers, but should be included in the multidisciplinary treatment of head and neck cancer patients in order to reduce the rate of severe adverse events in particular.
This article is therefore intended to contribute to a better understanding of the importance of pretherapeutic assessment of frailty, nutritional status and its optimization, as well as further explain the concept of prehabilitation in head and neck oncology.
