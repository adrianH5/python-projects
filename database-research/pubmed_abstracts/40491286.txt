Colorectal large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, a rare and aggressive type of cancer, accounts for <0.6% of all colorectal cancers.
Neuroendocrine carcinomas are associated with hereditary conditions such as Lynch syndrome; however, their co-occurrence with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is poorly documented.
To date, only 1 patient of colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma in a patient with FAP has been reported.
This report presents a patient with FAP.
Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with lymph node metastasis was discovered during right colectomy.
Histopathological and immunohistochemical assessments confirmed neuroendocrine differentiation with a high Ki-67 index (>90%).
Genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic germline
