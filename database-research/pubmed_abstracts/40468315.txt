Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors found in women.
Plastic endoscopic surgery is a new surgical procedure that incorporates treatment for the tumor followed by breast reconstruction.
The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of plastic endoscopic surgery vs. traditional procedures (modified radical surgery) regarding the quality of life and clinical prognosis for patients with early-stage breast cancer.
