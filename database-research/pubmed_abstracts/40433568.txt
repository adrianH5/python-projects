Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a typical reproductive endocrine system disease with high incidence rate among childbearing age women.
Several clinical data show that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) might have therapeutic effects on PCOS, but the mechanisms are still unclear.
Here, we aim to assess the effects of semaglutide (a weekly preparation of GLP-1RAs) on PCOS in vivo.
