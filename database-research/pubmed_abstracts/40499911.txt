Free Latissimus Dorsi Flaps in Head and Neck Reconstruction at a Modern High-Volume Microsurgery Center.
Journal of Reconstructive Microsurgery , Published May 2025)on the use of free latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps in head and neck reconstruction, we provide additional insights based on our experience at a tertiary oncology center.
While the authors emphasize the LD flap as a salvage option, we highlight its value as a primary reconstructive choice in patients with contraindications to anterolateral thigh (ALT) flaps, including those with prior thigh trauma or unfavorable body habitus.
We also underscore the vascular advantages of the LD flap in comorbid patients, its utility in composite reconstructions when combined with parascapular elements, and its role in secondary surgery through pedicled approaches.
Furthermore, we discuss its benefits in infection control, aesthetic contouring, and dead space management.
Lastly, we advocate for the cephalic vein transposition as a reliable alternative venous outflow in vessel-depleted necks.
Our experience supports expanding the LD flap's indications beyond salvage use, reinforcing its versatility in modern head and neck reconstructive surgery.
