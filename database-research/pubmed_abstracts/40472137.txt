Effective leadership is essential in today's health care environment.
To date, no study exists identifying the best practices for Leader Development (LD) within the physical therapy profession, nor has there been a published review of existing leadership curricula against health care industry best practices.
The purpose of this project is to (1) design and develop a comprehensive checklist to guide physical therapy educators when developing and evaluating LD curricula and (2) to implement and evaluate this checklist by reviewing a current Leadership Development Program (LDP) within the physical therapy profession.
