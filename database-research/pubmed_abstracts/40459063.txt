There are currently no effective treatments available for clear cell ovarian cancer (CCC).
In this study, we aimed to identify effective drugs for CCC through high-throughput drug screening (HTDS) using ovarian cancer organoids and determine novel therapeutic targets based on the biological characteristics of CCC through omics analysis.
An ovarian cancer organoid biobank was established, and HTDS was conducted using CCC organoids based on libraries of 361 and 4,560 compounds.
The efficacy of the identified drugs was verified in in vitro and in vivo experiments using a patient-derived organoid xenograft mouse model.
Transcriptome analysis was performed to identify genes related to the pathways targeted by the identified drugs in CCC and to assess their potential as therapeutic targets.
Proteasome inhibitors and dinaciclib were extracted using HTDS and shown to inhibit tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.
CCC, like multiple myeloma, exhibited activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), and treatment with proteasome inhibitors further enhanced ER stress and UPR, ultimately leading to cell death.
Transcriptome analysis identified anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) as a key gene involved in UPR in CCC.
CRISPR knockout of AGR2 suppressed cell proliferation, increased sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors, and reversed platinum resistance in CCC.
AGR2 knockout also upregulated Schlafen 11, contributing to platinum sensitivity.
ER stress and the UPR are activated in CCC, and proteasome inhibitors disrupt this balance, ultimately leading to cell death.
AGR2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in CCC.
