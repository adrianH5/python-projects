This study explores the multifunctional application of vanadium ferrite-doped mesoporous bioactive glass-ceramics (MBGCs), presenting a novel approach to synergistically integrate chemohyperthermia and controlled cisplatin delivery in cancer treatment.
Using the sol-gel method, MBGC formulations were developed, which VF0510 (a formulation containing 5 mol% V
