Nanotechnology is an emerging field in the therapeutic domain of cancer research.
The development of novel anticancer agents in combination with nanotechnology is a highly promising area as it could offer safer and more effective delivery methods for better overall outcomes.
Considering this, a naturally occurring silkworm protein (sericin) was combined with nanoparticle formulations to explore the subsequent anticancer effects in breast cancer.
In this study, a breast cancer animal mice model was developed by using 7, 12-dimethylbenzneanthracene (DMBA) (a carcinogenic compound) followed by evaluation of the antitumor effects of a natural protein (sericin) and its nanoparticle conjugates.
For this purpose, the mice were treated with two different concentrations of individual sericin protein together with conjugated silver nanoparticles (100-200 mg/kg, b.w.).
Mice were dissected after 60 days of the treatment, and biochemical results showed that sericin and its conjugated nanoparticles had significant effects against the DMBA-induced carcinogenic group in comparison with the untreated control group.
Particularly, sericin-conjugated NPs induced more prominent effects in the animal model.
The histopathological analysis of the spleen and mammary tissues showed cytotoxic effects in the DMBA group, and sericin-conjugated NPs were highly effective and minimized the cytotoxic effects of DMBA.
Consequently, sericin-conjugated nanoparticles induced more efficient anti-breast tumor effects in animal mice models and have promising future clinical applications in overcoming drug resistance.
