Breast cancer (BC) as a heterogeneous disease is routinely managed according to its intrinsic subtypes.
Mammographic BC screening reduces overall mortality in females.
Our aim was to analyze the association between different intrinsic subtypes and mammography screening coverage (pre-screening-aged, screening-aged vs. post-screening-aged), attendance (attendance vs. non-attendance), and means of detection (screen-detected vs. interval BC) and BC survival.
