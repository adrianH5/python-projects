Outcomes for patients with early breast cancer have improved in recent years as detection and treatments have improved.
The goal of many recent trials has therefore been to identify patients in whom de-intensification of therapy may be appropriate, thereby maximizing the therapeutic ratio of breast cancer treatments.
In each discipline within breast cancer, surgery, radiation oncology, and medical oncology, trials have explored treatment de-escalation.
In surgery, studies evaluate the omission of surgery to the breast or axilla; in radiation oncology, studies evaluate reduced dose and/or number of fractions (hypofractionation), reduced target [partial breast irradiation (PBI)], and omission of RT altogether; in medical oncology, studies evaluate reduced duration, alternate forms, and omission of ET altogether.
In many cases, these studies have shown that targeted omission or de-intensification does not compromise outcomes.
The challenge in multidisciplinary care is how to implement these deintensification strategies for a particular patient in relation to other aspects of the overall treatment plan.
In this critical review, we review the data in support of omission or de-intensification of surgical, radiation, and endocrine therapies in patients with low risk breast cancer, and consider these approaches in relation to one another.
