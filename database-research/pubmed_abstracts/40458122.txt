Telomerase activation is essential to malignant transformation and progression including uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), while telomerase co-factor DKC1-mediated RNA pseudouridylation is required for functional telomerase by stabilizing telomerase RNA component (TERC) and its upregulation occurs in many cancers.
Surprisingly, there is only one publication studying DKC1 in UCEC, which shows its significant downregulation.
