Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is recognized as a major risk factor for gastric cancer (GC).
However, the precise mechanism by which H. pylori influences macrophage immune responses in cancer progression remains poorly understood.
This study investigates how H. pylori affects macrophage polarization via the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and its subsequent role in gastric cancer cell proliferation.
