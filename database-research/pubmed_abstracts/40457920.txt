Bauxite is an ore from which Aluminium is produced.
Malaysia, once the leading producer of bauxite has reduced production as mining activity has caused community outrage.
Due to concerns about health concerns, rising pollution and environmental hazards, the government has revoked the licenses of bauxite miners.
We therefore did a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between exposure to Bauxite and Alumina with mortality of overall cancer as well as specific types of cancers.
Participants of were individuals of all ages who were exposed to Bauxite and Alumina while working in Bauxite mines and Alumina refineries.
Exposure to bauxite and alumina did not cause variations in mortality of overall cancer and specific types of cancer such as cancer of lip, cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, cancer of digestive organs and others.
We conclude that there is no evidence that bauxite or alumina exposure cause increase mortality due to cancer but due to the small number of studies included in this review, we recommend more cohort studies to be done in future.
