Durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) is the standard of care for patients with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
However, patients often receive sequential chemoradiotherapy (sCRT) due to factors including advanced age or frailty, comorbidities, or disease- or access-related concerns.
The phase II PACIFIC-6 trial (NCT03693300) evaluated the safety of durvalumab after sCRT in this setting.
Interim results indicated a similar safety profile to that observed with durvalumab after cCRT, with encouraging preliminary efficacy.
We report outcomes from the final analysis.
