Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted imaging has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool for various oncologic and nononcologic conditions.
However, the increasing employment of FAP-targeted imaging with small-molecule radiotracers mandates a standardized reporting system to ensure consistent interpretation across various clinical scenarios, especially in oncologic imaging.
This study proposes an FAP reporting and data system (RADS) framework (FAP-RADS version 1.0) to address those needs, aiming to standardize FAP-targeted imaging reports, improve clinical communication, and support multicenter research.
