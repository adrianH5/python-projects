For gastric cancer patients, peritoneal metastasis poses a life-threatening risk due to the high incidence of treatment failure and disease recurrence.
Conducting additional research aimed at identifying more efficacious strategies is imperative for enhancing treatment outcomes.
This study examined the efficacy and safety of systemic chemotherapy plus a PD-1 inhibitor combination with intravenous or intraperitoneal bevacizumab for gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
