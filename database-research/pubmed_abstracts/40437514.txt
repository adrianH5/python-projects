Neuroblastoma and other peripheral nerve cell tumors (NB-PNT) are the most common extracranial solid tumors in children.
This study aimed to describe the global burden of NB-PNT across different age groups and genders, including incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in various countries and regions.
Additionally, we analyzed changes in the disease burden over the past three decades and predicted future trends up to 2036.
