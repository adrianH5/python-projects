Study DesignThis study is part of the AO Spine Metastatic Tumor Research and Outcomes Network [MTRON], an international multicenter prospective observational registry including patients with spinal metastases.ObjectivesThis study aims to elucidate the incidence of surgical complications, their risk factors and consequent effects on survival outcomes, hospital length of stay, and overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL) parameters in a large cohort of patients affected by spinal metastases who were surgically treated.MethodsAvailable data from February 2017 to July 2023 were analyzed.
The primary outcome of this study was the evaluation of the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative adverse events (AEs).
The secondary outcomes included the assessment of risk factors for surgery-related AEs and the impact of AEs on survival, length of hospital stay and quality of life.ResultsAmong the 1267 patients analyzed, 6.9% experienced intraoperative AEs and 19.3% experienced at least 1 postoperative AE.
Several factors resulted to be associated to the occurrence of postoperative AEs: age, smoking habit, poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status, previous radiation therapy at the index target, duration of surgery, number of instrumented levels, simultaneous anterior and posterior approach, presence of metastases at other sites, multiple spinal metastases.
Postoperative AEs were associated with reduced survival rates, increased hospital length of stay and poorer HRQOL outcomes, particularly in domains such as neurological function and mental health.
In general, surgery substantially improves HRQOL across multiple domains, with these benefits persisting over time despite the occurrence of AEs.
However, patients with preoperative risk factors, including comorbidities, smoking, neurological impairment, and prior radiation therapy, experienced less improvement.ConclusionsThe negative impact of AEs on overall survival and HRQOL could be associated with the presence of some preoperative parameters of frailty that are detected as risk factors for AEs occurrence.
This finding emphasizes the need for personalized preoperative assessments and optimized perioperative care strategies.
