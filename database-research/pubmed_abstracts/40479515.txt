FANCM-RMI is a protein-protein interaction that maintains genome stability during DNA repair events in cancers that rely on the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway for survival.
We report the first valid chemical inhibitors of the FANCM-RMI interaction discovered by screening cyclic peptides via mRNA display.
These inhibitors engage the FANCM-binding pocket of RMI1/2 with nanomolar affinity (
