Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) accounts for 40% of endometrial cancer-related deaths.
The standard of care for stages III and IV USC yields a 20%-30% survival at 2 years and a 10%-20% survival at 3-5 years.
Recent advances in the second-line treatment of advanced or recurrent USC are rapidly evolving.
Targeted therapeutic approaches with the use of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, as well as the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan, offer new hope for successful second-line therapies for patients.
However, further investigation into novel targeted therapeutic approaches is warranted, given the high burden of disease associated with this aggressive histological subtype.
USC shares clinical and genomic similarities with epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting a correlation with 'BRCAness'.
Niraparib, a potent PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor, was shown to have a positive impact on platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, regardless of the presence or absence of BRCA status.
Our hypothesis is that patients with stage III, stage IV and platinum-sensitive recurrent USC receiving niraparib maintenance in addition to standard therapy for USC may have an improved progression-free survival.
