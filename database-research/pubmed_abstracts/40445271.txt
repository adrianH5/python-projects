Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are known for their specific functions in the nervous system.
One of the latest factors to be studied is neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF).
NDNF was first introduced as NTF in 2010.
However, the NDNF-specific expression and function are somewhat different from other NTFs.
The most significant known function of NDNF seems to be its role in facilitating the migration of GnRH neurons.
To date, limited studies have been conducted on this gene.
Therefore, this study aims to review all the information from previous investigations.
Additionally, bioinformatics tools and other databases were used to investigate the functions, interactions, and conservation of NDNF.
The functional analysis suggested the involvement of conserved NDNF in various molecular and signaling pathways, such as cGMP-PKG and PI3K-AKT.
The association of NDNF variants and defects with other diseases and malignancies, such as cancers, seems to be clear.
The present study presents all available information on NDNF.
Further research is necessary to enhance our knowledge of NDNF.
