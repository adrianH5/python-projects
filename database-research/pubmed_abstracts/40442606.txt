Cancer patients with a pre-existing mental disorder or substance use disorder (SUD) have a poorer prognosis compared to other cancer patients, with suboptimal routes to diagnosis and treatment as possible contributing factors.
Shorter intervals from suspicion of cancer to start of cancer treatment have been observed following the implementation of Cancer Patient Pathways (CPP) in the Nordic countries, which may have led to a better prognosis.
We aimed to investigate whether incident cancer patients with and without pre-existing mental disorder or SUD were equally likely to be included in a CPP.
We also investigated the associations between pre-existing mental disorder or SUD and low primary care utilization, and cancers diagnosed post-emergency or close to death in non-CPP enrolees.
