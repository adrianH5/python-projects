A series of more than 20 new amides of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid with selected aromatic amines were synthesized, and the structures of all compounds were analyzed and elucidated.
Moreover, the compounds were subjected to the cytotoxicity assays in four cancer cell lines (CCRF-CEM, MCF7, HeLa, and G-361), using normal human fibroblasts (BJ) as reference cells for determining the toxicity of the investigated compounds.
