Background Violence and stress significantly contribute to the growing mental health crisis in Pakistan.
However, access to appropriate care remains limited for many.
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of violence and trauma on mental health, identify the prevalence of trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and assess gaps in mental healthcare integration.
Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Abbas Institute of Medical Sciences, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, from April 2024 to December 2024.
The study included 316 participants who had a history of exposure to violence or trauma and associated mental health issues.
Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that assessed demographic characteristics, trauma exposure, and mental health conditions.
Standardized diagnostic tools were employed to screen for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression.
Data analysis was carried out using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 26.0; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY).
Chi-square and t-tests were used to assess associations between trauma exposure and mental health outcomes.
A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results The most prevalent form of trauma exposure was domestic violence (n=102; 32.28%), followed by terrorism-related trauma (n=68; 21.52%) and natural disasters (n=60; 18.99%).
PTSD was the most common mental health condition, affecting 34.81% of participants (n=110).
Anxiety disorders were present in 31.01% of participants, while 26.90% (n=85) experienced depression.
Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between exposure to trauma and an increased prevalence of mental health disorders (p<0.001).
Conclusion The findings underscore the need for improvements in the integration of mental health services into primary healthcare systems in Pakistan.
There is a need for the development of community-based programs and the implementation of policy reforms aimed at providing comprehensive support to individuals affected by trauma-related mental health conditions.
