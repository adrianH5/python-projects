Ferroptosis serves as a pivotal mechanism in diverse clinical chemotherapeutics and physiological processes, profoundly impacting tumor metabolism and the tumor microenvironment.
Recently, the immunosuppression induced by ferroptosis has raised major concerns regarding tumor recurrence upon ferroptosis-based antitumor therapies.
However, due to the lack of cell specificity, the antitumor and immunosuppressive effects in ferroptosis are inherently intertwined.
Herein, we address the conflicting challenges between immunosuppression and antitumor efficacy in ferroptosis-based therapy by enabling cell-specific ferroptosis, thereby targeting tumors while sparing immune cells.
By employing a specially designed nanoagent, i.e., ferrous selenide half-shell-covered gold, we induce notable upregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and downregulation of prostaglandin E2, leading to an increase in CD
