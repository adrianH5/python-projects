Oral-related cancer accounts for the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths and one death every hour in the United States [1].
Several factors may contribute to the formation of oral tumors, including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets low in fruits and vegetables, age, and general lifestyle.
Smoking and alcohol consumption, in particular, have been found to contribute 80% and 61% to oral cancer in men and women, respectively [2].
It is also well-known that oral cancer is more prevalent in underprivileged groups, where access to healthcare and health education, particularly education on making informed decisions to protect one's health, is often not prioritized or enforced.
In recent studies, besides tobacco and alcohol, HPV has been identified as a prominent risk factor, particularly HPV type 16, for oropharyngeal cancer.
This virus is often associated with oropharyngeal cancers, which occur in the tonsils and base of the tongue.
