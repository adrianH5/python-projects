Breast cancer is the most diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally.
Cuproptosis plays a significant role in tumor progression and therapeutic response.
Increasing studies suggest that targeting cuproptosis presents a promising strategy for cancer therapy, such as through the development of copper nanoparticles as therapeutic agents.
However, resistance to cuproptosis has emerged as a critical hallmark of cancer.
Therefore, it is essential to further investigate the mechanisms underlying cuproptosis resistance to enhance its therapy effect.
