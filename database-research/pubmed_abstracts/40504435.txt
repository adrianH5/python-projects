Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most common malignancy of the respiratory tract after lung cancer, presents symptoms like hoarseness, sore throat, and dysphagia, and about 150,000 new cases are diagnosed worldwide annually.
Risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and genetic variations, including TAS2R16 polymorphisms, significantly influence LSCC development.
Recent research suggests TAS2R16, a bitter taste receptor, may play a role in inflammation regulation and could be linked to cancer susceptibility, particularly in individuals with alcohol and nicotine dependency.
