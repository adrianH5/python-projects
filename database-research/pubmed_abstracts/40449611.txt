The intricate interplay between neurons and gliomas has emerged as an important area of investigation in glioma biology.
Accumulating evidence underscores that structural and material alterations constitute the fundamental basis of neuron‒glioma interactions and their pathological consequences.
This review comprehensively examines the mechanisms underlying these interactions, with a particular emphasis on specialized structures that facilitate neuron‒glioma communication, including synapses, cell surface ion channels, and tumor microtubules (TMs).
In addition to classical neurotransmitters, we highlight the exchange of cytokines, proteins, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) between these cell types.
By synthesizing current research findings, this review establishes a conceptual framework for developing innovative therapeutic strategies targeting neuron‒glioma interfaces, offering new perspectives for glioma treatment approaches.
