Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating hematologic malignancies.
However, its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited.
One of the major challenges is the lack of specific tumor antigens.
Therefore, the exploration and rational selection of novel tumor targets is urgently needed.
In this study, we investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting CD155 in cancer by CAR-T cells.
