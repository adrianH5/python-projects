This study investigates the use of list-mode (LM) maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation maximization (EM) incorporating prior information predicted by a convolutional neural network for image reconstruction in fast neutron (FN)-based proton therapy range verification.&#xD;Approach.
A conditional generative adversarial network (pix2pix) was trained on progressively noisier data, where detector resolution effects were introduced gradually to simulate realistic conditions.
FN data were generated using Monte Carlo simulations of an 85 MeV proton pencil beam in a computed tomography (CT)-based lung cancer patient model, with range shifts emulating weight gain and loss.
The network was trained to estimate the expected two-dimensional (2D) ground truth FN production distribution from simple back-projection images.
Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and the correlation between shifts in predicted distributions and true range shifts.
&#xD;Main results.
Our results show that pix2pix performs well on noise-free data but suffers from significant degradation when detector resolution effects are introduced.
Among the LM-MAP-EM approaches tested, incorporating a mean prior estimate into the reconstruction process improved performance, with LM-MAP-EM using a mean prior estimate outperforming na√Øve LM maximum likelihood EM (LM-MLEM) and conventional LM-MAP-EM with a smoothing quadratic energy function in terms of SSIM.
&#xD;Significance.
Findings suggest that deep learning techniques can enhance iterative reconstruction for range verification in proton therapy.
However, the effectiveness of the model is highly dependent on data quality, limiting its robustness in high-noise scenarios.&#xD.
