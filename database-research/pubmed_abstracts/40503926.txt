Exposomics is a conceptual framework positioned at the intersection of environmental health sciences and precision medicine.
It seeks to comprehensively understand how environmental exposures and the body's response to these exposures impact human health across the life course.
Introduced in 2005, the exposome concept represents a paradigm shift from single-pollutant studies to an integrated approach considering a broad range of exposures.
