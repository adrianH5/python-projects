Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is one of the important treatment modalities for a wide range of malignant and nonmalignant hematological disorders, as well as congenital and acquired disorders of the immune system.
Through bone marrow transplantation, candidates face unique challenges throughout the treatment process, which can be accompanied by high physical and psychological burdens.
To address the challenges, emerging interventions, such as supportive and palliative care, have shown significant potential for improving quality of life, enhancing overall well-being, alleviating pain, and reducing patient symptoms.
The integration of supportive and palliative care in all types of bone marrow transplantation has become increasingly crucial throughout all phases of transplantation, including pre-, during, and post.
Therefore, there has to be a specialized team available that can provide complete care, from diagnosis to post-transplantation.
Supportive and palliative care requires collaboration for their shared efforts in meeting the special needs of the patients, increasing their quality of life, hope, mood, and well-being.
Accordingly, supportive and palliative care, as an integral part of the transplant process, provides patients comprehensive care that addresses their physical, emotional, and psychological well-being.
