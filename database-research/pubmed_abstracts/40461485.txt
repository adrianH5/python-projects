To evaluate the value of self-made breast model in preoperative communication between doctors and patients with breast cancer.
200 patients with mammary tumor were randomly divided into control group and model group (100 patients in each group).
The control group received traditional preoperative interpretation, and the model group used self-made breast model to assist interpretation.
The mastery degree and satisfaction degree of the two groups were compared.
The average score of communication mastery in model group (80.23 ± 11.46) was significantly higher than that in control group (64.01 ± 13.29) (P < 0.001).
Satisfaction was significantly higher in the model group than in the control group in all four surgical subgroups (P < 0.05).
The self-made breast teaching model can significantly improve the understanding and satisfaction of patients with preoperative communication, which is beneficial to the diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases.
