CDKL3 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-Like 3) is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase-like (CDKL) family.
The first cloning of human CDKL3 was achieved in 1999.
Despite the fact that the CDKL3 sequence shares features of both the MAPK (Mitogen-Associated Protein Kinase) and CDK (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase), suggesting that it may have important physiological functions, CDKL3 has long been under-explored.
Over the past two decades, studies have revealed the involvement of CDKL3 in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression.
However, the in-depth mechanism by which it exerts these effects remains to be elucidated.
Recently, we have performed systematic studies on CDKL3, providing a comprehensive revelation of the pivotal role of CDKL3 in cell cycle regulation, metabolic disease, cancer initiation and progression.
We hence review CDKL3 in terms of its molecular mechanism, function and the relevance of CDKL3 to other proteins, and discuss the future perspectives in studying CDKL3.
