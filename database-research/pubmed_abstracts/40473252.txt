Open window thoracostomy (OWT) is an ancient surgical intervention, born for managing chronic thoracic infectious diseases.
Our goal is to report our 25-year experience in the management of these patients, focusing on its feasibility and usefulness in our modern era.We retrospectively reviewed our database (1999-2024), reporting all clinical preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data of patients undergoing OWT for treating chronic empyema, linked to broncho-pleural fistula after lung resection, or not.
Data were collected on the type of original surgical intervention, perioperative and postoperative management, 30- and 90-day mortality, overall survival, and following reintervention to close OWT.Sixty-six OWTs were performed to treat acute and chronic septic complications due to original lung intervention for cancer.
OWT was performed for treating a late broncho-pleural fistula after pneumonectomy (56 cases; 85%) or after lobectomy (8 cases; 12%) or pleural chronic empyema (2 cases; 3%).
Thirty- and 90-day mortality after OWT following pneumonectomy was 3% (2 patients) and 6% (4 patients), respectively.
No 30- and 90-day death was observed in the other patients.
In 15 out of 66 patients (22.7%), OWT was closed by muscle, skin, or omentum flaps.
No statistical differences were observed comparing the survival of the patients undergoing or not undergoing OWT closure, after pneumonectomy (
