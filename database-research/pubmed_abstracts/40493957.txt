Casein kinase 2 (CK2) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target across a broad spectrum of malignancies, including pediatric and orphan cancers.
The identification of a ligandable allosteric αD pocket on the CK2α subunit has enabled the development of bivalent inhibitors, which bind simultaneously to both the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) site and the allosteric pocket.
Here, we report the discovery and pharmacological characterization of
