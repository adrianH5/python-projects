The increasing implementation of the 3R principles of reduce, replace, and refine, as well as costs and ethical considerations associated with animal experiments, will lead to an incremental reduction in in vivo experimentation.
To fill the gap between in vitro generated data and findings obtained following in vivo animal experiments, there is an urgent need for reliable and robust in vitro models with high comparability to the respective in vivo situation.
This applies in particular for models of the central nervous system (CNS) due its unique anatomical and physiological characteristics with the resulting limited accessibility for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and, simultaneously, the devastating consequences of CNS diseases.
Sophisticated in vitro canine models will contribute to progression in veterinary medicine and are uniquely suited to study a broad range of human diseases, including monogenic hereditary illnesses, cancers, degenerative and inflammatory diseases, and epilepsy.
In addition, notable neurotropic or pantropic pathogens such as rabies virus, canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus,
