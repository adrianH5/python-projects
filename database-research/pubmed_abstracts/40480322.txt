MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression, playing pivotal roles in cancer biology.
Among these, miR-429, a member of the miR-200 family, influences migration, metastasis, apoptosis, and cell proliferation, all of which are vital for controlling cancer biology.
This review examined the biogenesis, regulation, and signaling pathways associated with miR-429, as well as its interactions with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and other molecular networks that contribute to tumorigenesis.
We explore its diverse expression patterns across various malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and glioblastoma, highlighting its dual role in tumorigenesis and metastasis.
Additionally, it addresses the clinical relevance of miR-429, assessing its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and its promising therapeutic implications.
Through a detailed analysis of miR-429 expression patterns and their impact across different cancer types, this review highlights its complex mechanisms in different cancers and its potential for targeted cancer therapy.
