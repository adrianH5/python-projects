Malignant tumour represents a significant global public health concern.
The advent of immunotherapy has brought about a revolutionary shift in the landscape of tumour treatment, offering a ray of hope to patients across the globe.
Immunotherapy strategies have demonstrated considerable promise in clinical trials.
However, the immunosuppressive environment within the tumour microenvironment has constituted a significant obstacle to the advancement of immunotherapies.
It is therefore imperative to develop more efficacious and personalised approaches.
The utilisation of non-invasive ultrasound-assisted immunotherapy represents a promising strategy.
Ultrasound has the capacity to induce an immune response and stimulate other drugs to achieve a specific response, thereby reducing the toxic side effects of treatment and enhancing the outcome of immunotherapy.
This paper presents a systematic introduction to the various mechanisms related to ultrasound and reviews the recent advancements of ultrasound-assisted tumour immunotherapy, including ultrasonic ablation, combined application with contrast agents, and sonodynamic therapy.
