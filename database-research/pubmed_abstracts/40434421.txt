Recent findings have demonstrated that Docetaxel (DTX) and Carboplatin (CRP) exhibit significant anticancer and antiproliferative properties in cancer cells.
This study aims to explore the effects of DTX on enhancing CRP-induced apoptosis in liver cancer cells and the associated molecular pathways.
