Some patients undergoing prostatectomy develop biochemical recurrence or have persistently detectable prostate-specific antigen level.
Salvage radiotherapy (RT), delivered over ≥4 wk, is a current standard of care.
Our objective was to demonstrate that salvage RT delivered in a five-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) regimen does not significantly increase patient-reported genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms compared with a 20-fraction regimen (HYPO).
