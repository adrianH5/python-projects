Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical instillation therapy is the standard treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).
One of the factors that may affect the risk of recurrence after TURBT is the quality of surgery that may vary between individual surgeons.
While there has been a large number of studies demonstrating the ability to reduce the risk of recurrence of NMIBC with different types of the intravesical therapy, less attention was paid to the quality of TURBT in improving long-term treatment results.
The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of the quality of TURBT on the recurrence rate of NMIBC based on surgeon experience.
