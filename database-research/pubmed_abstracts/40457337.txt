First-void urine (FVU) collection for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing has game-changing potential to improve cervical cancer prevention among under-screened women who remain unreached by clinician-based cervical cancer screening and vaginal self-sampling.
Yet, the wide variation in the clinical accuracy of hrHPV testing in urine for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 + /CIN3 +) across studies and clinical settings highlights the importance of local piloting and validation.
This study determined the relative clinical accuracy of hrHPV testing in FVU versus clinician-collected cervical samples to detect CIN2 + /CIN3 + in a Danish referral population.
