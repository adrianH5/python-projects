Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is characterized by an unusual and persistent sensation of tiredness that can occur during or after treatment, potentially impacting both physical and mental capability, and which does not ameliorate with rest.
Aerobic exercise (AE) has been identified as a potent modality to mitigate the severity of CRF in such patients.
