The increased risk of fractures associated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) therapy has been well established in clinical trials; however, data on Asian populations remain limited.
Furthermore, the impact of AIs on fracture risk across different age groups and breast cancer stages has not been thoroughly investigated.
This study aimed to assess the association between AIs therapy and major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) in postmenopausal Taiwanese women with breast cancer using real-world data.
