Growing evidence suggests that immune/inflammatory pathways play a crucial role in the persistence of symptoms in diverticular disease (DD).
We hypothesize that chronic diverticulitis triggers a self-sustained inflammatory status which can be detected by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
The aim of this study was to investigate the systemic levels of TNF-α and IL-6 before and after elective surgery in patients with DD, and their relationship with the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) score.
