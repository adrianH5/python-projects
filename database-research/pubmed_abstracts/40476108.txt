Background Soft tissue neoplasm is a broad term referring to tumors that can arise from various tissues, including muscle, tendons, fat, nerves, and lymphatic and blood vessels.
These neoplasms may be either benign or malignant, with classification based on the tissue of origin and tumor behavior.
The aim of this study was to assess the relative frequency of soft tissue neoplasms among all neoplasms, determine the incidence of benign and malignant soft tissue tumors (STTs), and examine variations in age, sex, anatomical location, and histological subtypes.
Methods This descriptive study was conducted at Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Government Medical College, Ambajogai, India, from November 2015 to November 2017.
It included cases of soft tissue neoplasms diagnosed through clinical history and examination, followed by biopsy or surgical excision and histopathological analysis.
Results A total of 200 soft tissue neoplasm cases were identified out of 4,494 neoplasms recorded during the study period, accounting for 4.45% of all neoplasms.
Of these, 188 cases (94%) were benign and 12 cases (6%) were malignant.
Benign neoplasms were most common in individuals aged 21-40 years and showed a slight male predominance.
The upper extremity was the most frequent site for benign STTs, followed by the trunk, head and neck, and lower extremity.
In contrast, malignant soft tissue neoplasms were most commonly found in the lower extremity.
Among the 200 soft tissue neoplasms, adipocytic tumors were the most prevalent, comprising 105 cases (52.5%), followed by vascular neoplasms with 32 cases (16%) and peripheral nerve sheath tumors with 22 cases (11%).
Conclusions This study provides insight into the clinicopathological features of soft tissue neoplasms, highlighting their distribution across different age groups, sexes, anatomical sites, and histological subtypes.
