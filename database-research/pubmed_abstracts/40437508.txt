Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for localized prostate cancer offers non-inferior oncological outcomes and toxicity profiles compared to conventionally or moderately hypofractioned radiotherapy regimens, with shorter treatment durations.
However, SBRT may not be suitable for all patients, particularly those with lower urogenital tract symptoms and/or prostatic hyperplasia.
