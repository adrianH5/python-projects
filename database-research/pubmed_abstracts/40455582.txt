The Alinity m HR HPV assay is a qualitative molecular assay that simultaneously detects high-risk human papillomavirus (hr HPV) genotypes HPV16, 18, and 45 and reports the 11 other hr HPV genotypes in 2 aggregates as other HR HPV A (HPV31, 33, 52, 58) and other HR HPV B (HPV35, 39, 51, 56, 59, 66, 68).
Here, we describe the prevalence of hr HPV genotypes in the Alinity m HR HPV assay US clinical trial population stratified by age, cytology, and cervical disease status.
