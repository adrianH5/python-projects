Chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in the development and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Prostate cancer with bone metastasis (PCa-BM) is the most common metastatic form of advanced prostate cancer in the elderly, significantly affecting prognosis and quality of life Although chemotherapy is commonly used for PCa-BM, the chronic inflammation it causes may exacerbate the risk of joint injuries to induce RA and related complications.
Therefore, exploring the risk of chemotherapy-induced chronic inflammation on RA risk in PCa-BM patients holds critical importance.
