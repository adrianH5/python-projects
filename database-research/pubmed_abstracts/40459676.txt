Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) for HER2 + breast cancer (HER2 + BC) has historically been used to downstage disease to facilitate surgical de-escalation; however, in 2019, the KATHERINE trial identified a survival benefit to adjuvant T-DM1 for those with residual disease after NST.
We aimed to determine national rates of NST for patients with cT1-2 N0 M0 HER2 + BC and identify factors associated with receipt of NST vs upfront surgery with adjuvant systemic therapy (US-AST).
