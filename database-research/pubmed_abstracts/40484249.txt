Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), are leading risk factors for liver cancer.
While inflammation and fibrosis are known to promote tumorigenesis in advanced MASH, it remains unclear how earlier stages of MASLD contribute to cancer initiation.
Here, we investigated how steatosis alone, in the absence of significant fibrosis and inflammation, influences liver cancer development in mouse models.
