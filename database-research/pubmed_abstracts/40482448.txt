Bisphenols are widely found in plastic products and may be hazardous to human health due to their estrogenic effects.
Bisphenols may be involved in the carcinogenic process through endocrine-disrupting properties, especially in breast cancer.
However, the specific targets and mechanisms of bisphenols remain unclear.
By integrating network toxicology, transcriptomics, and molecular docking technology, this study aims to methodically identify the possible targets and mechanisms of five bisphenols in causing breast cancer.
Targets linked to breast cancer were screened using the disease database, and bisphenols targets were screened using the compound and its prediction database.
Ultimately, 424 targets associated with bisphenols and breast cancer were selected.
With the STRING database, Cytoscape, and enrichment analysis, 12 core targets were identified, which are predominantly engaged in chemical carcinogenesis - receptor activation and estrogen signaling pathway.
Furthermore, 26 common differentially expressed genes, including the core target PGR, were found by transcriptomic analysis in human breast cancer cells exposed to four bisphenols.
Molecular docking showed that the PGR protein and five bisphenols had the lowest binding energy (-7.7 ∼ -7.0 kcal/mol) and the highest binding affinity.
This study suggests that bisphenols may bind to PGR and induce its expression, thus contributing to breast carcinogenesis.
This may happen via chemical cancer-receptor activation, estrogen signaling pathway, and endocrine resistance pathway.
This study offers a theoretical basis for disease prevention and control besides providing a new perspective on the pathogenic mechanism of environmental pollutants.
It also promotes the application of the integrated research strategy of network toxicology, bioinformatics, and molecular docking technology in environmental pollutants research.
