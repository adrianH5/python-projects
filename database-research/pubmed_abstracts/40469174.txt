Microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair (MMR) protein testing is important for Lynch syndrome (LS) identification, prognostic stratification, and immune checkpoint inhibitor screening in many solid malignancies.
MSH6, an MMR protein, is less studied in LS, and the exact mechanism of inconsistent MSI and MMR results among endometrial cancer (EC) patients who are carriers of MSH6 mutations remains unclear.
The aim of this study was to identify the molecular patterns and clinicopathological characteristics of MSH6 protein-deficient LS-related EC and to further investigate possible causes of discordant MSI and IHC results in
