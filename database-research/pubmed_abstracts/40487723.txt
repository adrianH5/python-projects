A sub-fractionation workflow enables a substantial reduction in planning target volume (PTV) margin in prostate cancer (PCa) patients by reducing systematic motion during magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiotherapy.
This study assessed geometric and reconstructed dose outcomes in patients treated with a tight-margin sub-fractionation workflow on a combined linear accelerator with a 1.5Â T MRI scanner (MR-Linac).
