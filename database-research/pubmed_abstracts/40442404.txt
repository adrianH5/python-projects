Cystic brain metastases (CBM) present significant clinical challenges due to their heterogeneity and the limitations of current diagnostic methods in guiding treatment.
Traditional tissue biopsies are invasive and may not capture tumour heterogeneity, while plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis is impeded by the blood-brain barrier, leading to low sensitivity for detecting intracranial lesions.
These limitations create a critical gap in the personalised management of patients with CBM.
