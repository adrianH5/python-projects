Venetoclax (VEN) plus a hypomethylating agent (HMA) regimen is the standard of care for older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, it is associated with significant myelosuppression and complications, potentially limiting its use in those who are very old.
We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of VEN-HMA treatment in octogenarians and nonagenarians to further understand the tolerability, feasibility, dosing considerations, and clinical efficacy in this unique group.
Patients with AML aged ≥80 years who received VEN-HMA between March 2015 and April 2022 were reviewed.
VEN-HMA dosing was determined by treating physician, accounting for CYP3A4 drug interaction dose adjustments.
In total, 154 patients were included, with a median age of 82 years (range, 80-92), who received treatment with VEN-HMA (83% with azacitidine and 17% with decitabine).
Most patients (53%) had European LeukemiaNet 2017 adverse risk AML, 33% had intermediate, 8% had favorable, and 6% were unknown.
With a median follow-up of 7.7 months, 36 patients (23%) remained in remission, with 31 (20%) still on VEN-HMA.
The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 8.5% and 17%, respectively.
The composite complete remission (CRc) rate for patients with newly diagnosed AML without prior myelodysplastic syndrome was 73% (48 of 66).
Median overall survival (OS) was 8.1 months, and in patients who achieved a response (CRc), median OS was 13.2 months.
Landmark analysis from the time CRc was first achieved showed that patients receiving VEN for ≤14 days had improved OS; median, 24.0 months.
Patients who are very old can be treated safely with combination VEN-HMA with expectations of dose reductions and cycle extensions to ensure tolerability over the long term.
