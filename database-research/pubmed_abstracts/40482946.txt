After treatment for cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) patients remain at risk for recurrent AIS, high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and cervical carcinoma (combined AIS/CIN3+).
This study aimed to determine the optimal follow-up strategy for high-risk HPV and cytology testing in conservatively treated patients with AIS.
