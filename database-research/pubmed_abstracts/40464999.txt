The purpose of this study was investigating the risk factors of biochemical failure in cases with positive surgical margins after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
We identified 630 cases of RARP that had been performed in a single institution from November 2011 to December 2017.
A total of 145 cases showed positive surgical margin after RARP.
After excluding patients that had undergone adjuvant therapies (androgen deprivation or radiation), 114 cases were evaluated.
Clinical and pathological parameters were investigated in this cohort and were analyzed to identify factors predicting biochemical failure.
Subsequently, we developed a risk classification based on these risk factors.
The median values of PSA, age, preoperative prostate volume, were 67 (internal quartile range [IQR]: 65-72) years, 9.3 (6.5-12.0) ng/mL, and 37 (25-45) cm
