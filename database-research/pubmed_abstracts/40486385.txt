Although cancer-related mortality in the United States (US) has generally been decreasing, this has not occurred among Hispanic populations, where cancer is the leading cause of death.
The population growth of the Hispanic population in the US from 2010 to 2021 was substantially larger than the overall US population growth rate (24% vs. 7%).
This increased population growth adds importance to addressing cancer care delivery barriers facing this patient population.
We discuss early implementation of the Navigator-Assisted Hypofractionation (NAVAH) program in addressing these barriers.
