Eutymeroterpenoids A-G (1-7), seven new eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids, together with one known compound cryptosphaerolide (8), were isolated from marine-derived Eutypella scoparia GZU-4-19Y.
Their structures were established by analysis of their NMR data and electronic circular dichroism calculations.
All of them featured the unique 11â€‘carbon alkyl chain were rarely found in natural sesquiterpenoids.
The isolates were evaluated for their anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro.
Compounds 4, 5, 7 and 8 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against two human cancer cell lines (HT29 and HepG2).
In addition, compounds 5 and 8 displayed good inhibitory activities against lipopolysaccharide-induced NO production in RAW264.7 cells with IC
