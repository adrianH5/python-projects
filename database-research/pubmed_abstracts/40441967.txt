A recent study published in Nature Medicine shows that adoptive cell therapy using neoantigen-selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is feasible in refractory metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, showing durable responses, especially when combined with anti-PD-1.
Despite low tumor mutational burden (TMB), enriched neoantigen-reactive TIL improved objective response rates (ORR), highlighting the role of the tumor microenvironment and supporting further clinical development.
