Suboccipital craniotomy in the park bench position is linked to considerable physiological alterations.
Effective fluid management in this context is a challenge to anesthesiologists.
No published data exist on pulse pressure variation and central venous pressure guidance in patients undergoing tumor resection in the park bench posture.
We undertake a study to evaluate the concept that two approaches of goal-directed fluid treatment enhance optimal fluid management and improve hemodynamic stability.
We established the fluid management protocol for this process.
