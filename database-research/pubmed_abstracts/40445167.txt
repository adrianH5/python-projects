Brain solid tumors are a leading cause of cancer-related mortality at all ages.
The updated 2021WHO Central Nervous System tumor classification is based on genomic diagnostics.
Nonetheless, extracellular vesicles (EVs) proteomics is a platform for protein biomarker discovery in brain tumor patient management.
Tumor metabolic reprogramming, also through epigenetic mechanisms, is central to cancer.
EVs transfer proteins and nucleic acids that relay the metabolic and redox state of the parent cells.
