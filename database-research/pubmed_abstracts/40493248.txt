Protocatechualdehyde (PCA) is a phenolic aldehyde with many pharmacological features.
It is composed of two hydroxyl groups attached to C3 and C4 of the benzene ring.
This review aims to discover the source of PCA, discuss its pharmacological efficiency, investigate its implication in related mechanistic pathways, approve safety, and elaborate scientific foundation for future studies.
This compound has been detected in various plants, especially Salviae Miltiorrhiza Bumge.
which is considered as the main source.
PCA has been confirmed to possess strong antioxidant activity by inhibiting free radicals in different in vivo and in vitro models.
Interestingly, PCA has an important anticancer potential and is involved in various mechanistic pathways, such as apoptosis in different cancer cells, degradation of cyclin expression, cell cycle arrest, and downregulated regulator proteins.
Furthermore, this molecule has a clear effect in reducing inflammation via inhibition of cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukins (IL-6, IL-1β), reduction of NLRP3, GSDMD, and caspase-1 expression, activation of the Nrf2 pathway, and suppression of the ERK/c-Fos/NFATc1 signaling axis.
In addition, the antimicrobial proprieties and antibiofilm activity of PCA have been proved on Micrococcus luteus, MRSA, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
Also, it is highly reported in neurological illness and cardiovascular treatment.
Particularly, PCA exhibits significant anti-atherosclerosis activity, protects skin, and is valuable for endothelial function.
Exploring the pharmacokinetic applications, toxicity and recent advances in researches on PCA, we have developed the scientific insights required for future research for the accurate exploitation of PCA in future pre-clinical and clinical trials.
