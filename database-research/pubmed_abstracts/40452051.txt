Cytological samples are genotyped to inform clinical management of HPV-infected women due to their accessibility.
Conversely, HPV genotypes identified in biopsies are deemed directly associated with cervical lesions.
Thus, investigating genotyping agreement between these two sample types and potential influence of lesion severity and vaccination status on their degree of concordance is essential for understanding their diagnostic reliability.
