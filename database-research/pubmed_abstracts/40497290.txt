Early detection of lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening can shift diagnoses to early-stage disease and improve survival.

We report here secondary and exploratory endpoints of the Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer combined with different smoking cessation approach in Finland (LDCT-SC-FI) study including recruitment channels, LDCT performance, and long-term smoking cessation.
