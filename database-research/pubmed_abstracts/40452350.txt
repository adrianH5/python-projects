Breast cancer is one of the leading cancer types in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Although developing technology, early diagnosis and treatment opportunities provide positive contributions to the treatment of breast cancer, research on new drugs that are less toxic to healthy cells, safer and more effective for cancer cells, increasing the quality of life of the patient is still ongoing.
Coumarin and its derivatives have been shown great interest to develop safer and more effective anticancer drugs.
Therefore, we investigated the anticancer activity of novel coumarin-3-carboxamide derivative 3i in MDA-MB-231 cells.
We found that coumarin-3-carboxamide derivative 3i inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration.
However, coumarin-3-carboxamide derivative 3i did not induce apoptosis and autophagy.
Consequently, our findings suggest for the first time that novel coumarin-3-carboxamide 3i has anticancer activity and may be an important drug candidate for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.
Further investigations are required to elucidate its impact on breast cancer.
