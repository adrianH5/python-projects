Patients with gastric atrophy (GA) and intestinal metaplasia (GIM) are considered to be at risk for gastric neoplasia (GN: dysplasia or cancer).
During the last decades, standards of practice and endoscopic technologies have been developed and proposed.
This meta-analysis reassesses GN incidence rates in GA and GIM patients, analyzing its evolution and the impact of standard protocols and scores.
