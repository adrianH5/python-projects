Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is carcinogenic and has the potential to cause progressive gastric lesions and gastric cancer (GC), which also represents one of the essential constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GC.
The infiltration and functional status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME affect the anti-tumor function of the body.
However, the impact of H. pylori on anti-tumor immunity and prognosis of GC is still unclear.
