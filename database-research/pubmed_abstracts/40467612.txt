Esophageal cancer has an overall five-year survival rate of < 20%.
The McKeown esophagectomy is invasive and carries a high risk of anastomotic leakage.
Robust prospective outcome data comparing non-placement versus placement of a cervical drainage tube during McKeown esophagectomy are lacking.
This study aimed to evaluate whether the placement of a cervical drainage tube is useful.
In this randomized controlled, noninferiority trial, 106 patients with histologically proven, surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma were randomized to either placement or non-placement of a cervical drainage tube.
The primary outcome was the percentage of Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher anastomotic leakage.
Secondary outcomes included the duration from surgery to oral intake, hospital stay, and type and dose of analgesics used during hospitalization.
Fifty-two and 54 patients were randomized to McKeown esophagectomy with non-placement and placement of a cervical drainage tube, respectively.
There was no significant difference in anastomotic leakage rates between the non-placement (12/52 [23%]) and placement (13/54 [24%]) of drainage tube.
However, non-inferiority was not demonstrated (risk difference, -0.100 [-0.17, 0.15]; p = 0.0591).
There were no significant differences in the secondary outcome measures.
Non-inferiority of nonplacement of a drainage tube around the cervical anastomosis after McKeown esophagectomy to placement of that was not demonstrated.
Further large multicenter studies are needed.Trial registration: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (identification number jRCT1052180016).
