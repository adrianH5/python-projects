Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection drives cervical carcinogenesis, yet regional variations in genotype distribution and viral load dynamics remain understudied in Beijing, China.
This study investigated HPV prevalence, genotype-specific patterns, and viral load correlations with cervical disease severity among women outpatient clinics from Peking University First Hospital in Beijing.
In a retrospective study of 25 197 women undergoing cervical ThinPrep cytology (TCT) and HPV testing from October 2023 to October 2024, colposcopy results from 714 cases were also analyzed.
HPV genotyping and quantitative for HPV types (16, 18, 33, 52, 58) were performed.
Overall HPV positivity was 16.50% (4157/25 197), peaking in women aged 31~40 years (30.05%).
Dominant genotypes were HPV 52 (18.89%), 16 (18.55%), and 58 (12.10%).
HR-HPV prevalence and viral load escalated with disease severity (p < 0.001), notably HPV16 and HPV33.
HPV11, 43, 45, and 68 were absent in severe lesions.
Single infections (76.35%) predominated, but multi-infections showed genotype synergism (e.g., HPV51 + 42).
The study highlights specific HPV epidemiology and genotype dominance in China, indicating gaps in vaccine coverage.
Viral load is a key biomarker for risk assessment, suggesting the need for tailored vaccination programs and viral load monitoring in clinical practice.
