Leptomeningeal metastasis in medulloblastoma poses challenges for effective treatments due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may be addressed through intrathecal or intraventricular drug delivery.
However, the lack of pharmacokinetic modeling for pathological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) geometries has limited the ability to predict effective intrathecal and intraventricular drug exposure.
