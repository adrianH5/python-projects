While rare, esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have higher malignant potential and are typically diagnosed at larger sizes compared to gastric GISTs.
However, well-defined guidelines for their optimal management remain lacking.
Most esophageal GISTs are surgically managed with enucleation, while esophagectomy is reserved for larger tumors.
Recent advances in endoscopic techniques, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection and submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (ER), have allowed for endoscopic removal of submucosal esophageal lesions, including GISTs.
