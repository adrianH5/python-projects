Breast cancer (BC) is a complex heterogenous disease that is a leading cause of death in women.
For patients with early stage disease following primary BC therapy, approximately 30% will develop metastatic BC (MBC).
The median survival of MBC patients is ~ 2-3 yr.
While the early detection and monitoring of BC progression have improved prognosis and reduced BC-related mortality, there is a lack of long-term surveillance strategies for monitoring patients for recurrence of MBC.
The aim of our study was to identify non-invasive urinary biomarkers for detection and monitoring of MBC.
