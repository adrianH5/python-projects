The local surgical treatment of thyroid cancer recurrence poses significant challenges, particularly when addressing areas affected by extensive scar tissue.
Cryoablation of local recurrences might be a promising minimally invasive alternative, especially for patients who are not ideal surgical candidates or prefer nonsurgical interventions.
This report discusses 2 cases of recurrent thyroid cancer successfully managed with curative intent cryoablation.
Follow-up ultrasound revealed complete involution in the first patient, and 73% volume reduction of the lesion in the second patient.
No delayed complications were observed.
It underlines the potential of cryoablation as a feasible treatment option for local recurrence of thyroid cancer and advocates for future research to better define its role within thyroid cancer management protocols.
