Out of several types of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), glioblastoma (GBM) represents one of the most frequent and malignant forms of brain neoplasms.
To date, GBM holds very limited therapeutic options leaving patients with poor prognosis of survival.
As such, novel treatment approaches are constantly quested.
One of these strategies is based on the utilization of proteasome inhibitors (PIs).
However, although several PIs have been approved as therapy for patients with hematological malignancies, these treatment benefits cannot not be easily extrapolated to brain tumors.
This is mostly due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeability of the majority of PIs, which is then followed by their low brain bioavailability.
Marizomib (MZB) is a unique, irreversible, second-generation proteasome inhibitor, which unlike other PIs can penetrate through the BBB, making it a promising therapeutic tool in brain tumors.
Despite an indisputable therapeutic potential of MZB, it has yet failed to be successfully introduced to the clinics as a ready-to-use chemotherapy for GBM-suffering patients.
Therefore, in this work we describe the potential of PIs as candidates for neuro-oncological drugs, present results of preclinical and clinical investigations concerning MZB in brain tumors, discuss possible reasons of failure of MZB-based therapies and delineate future directions of MZB-related studies.
