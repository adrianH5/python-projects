Gastric cancer has a risk of early transcoelomic spread.
Despite perioperative chemotherapy and surgery, peritoneal recurrence is a frequent contributor to mortality.
The addition of neoadjuvant normothermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) allows early treatment of microscopic disease.
Our study aims to systematically evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant IPC in patients with gastric cancer who are at high risk of peritoneal recurrence.
