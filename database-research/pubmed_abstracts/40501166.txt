Steatotic liver disease (SLD) is an overarching term to encompass metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MASLD with increased alcohol intake (MetALD), and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD).
However, the impact of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on the association between SLD and mortality risk remains uncertain.
This study aims to compare all-cause and cause-specific mortality across SLD subtypes stratified by MetS.
