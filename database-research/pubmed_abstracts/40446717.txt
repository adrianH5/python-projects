Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of apoptosis, differs from the caspase-dependent apoptosis.
Mitochondria plays an irreplaceable role in the ferroptosis processes.
Compared with normal mitochondria, mitochondria of ferroptosis process are characterized by smaller mitochondrial membrane densities, mitochondrial crista may be reduced.
The microenvironmental parameter viscosity is active in the physiological processes of mitochondrial respiration and metabolism.
Abnormal mitochondrial viscosity concentration have been linked to many diseases, including diabetes, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and even cancer.
Monitoring the change of mitochondrial viscosity is of great significance for understanding the occurrence of ferroptosis disease.
So far, some fluorescent probes reported have short absorption and emission wavelengths and small Stokes shifts, which will affect its application in living tissues.
In our work, we reported four novel mitochondria-targeted NIR fluorescent probes for viscosity detection.
These probes contain different electron-donating groups, among which Mito-Vis-4 with large Stokes shift (200Â nm) and mitochondrial targetable can be used image the viscosity changes during ferroptosis process.
The results indicated that Mito-Vis-4 is a promising noninvasive and sensitive tool for monitor the viscosity changes in vivo.
