Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically effective antitumor treatment offering spatiotemporal precision, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity.
However, its application is limited by the shallow penetration of external light sources, particularly for deep-seated tumors.
Moreover, PDT alone often fails to fully inhibit tumor growth, prompting its combination with other modalities such as photothermal therapy (PTT), which induces tumor cell death through localized heating.
In this study, we developed a nano-bacteria biohybrid, EcN-QS-iLux@Pd@MC540, by biomineralizing the engineered probiotic
