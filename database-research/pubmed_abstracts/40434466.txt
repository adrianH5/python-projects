Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) has emerged as the primary treatment option for retinoblastoma management.
It enables the localized delivery of a higher concentration of chemotherapeutic agents (melphalan, carboplatin and topotecan) in the ophthalmic artery, enhancing tumour control and potentially avoiding the need for enucleation.
Nevertheless, procedure-related complications have raised concerns.
In this article, we outline the various technical considerations for performing safe IAC and minimizing procedure-related complications.
