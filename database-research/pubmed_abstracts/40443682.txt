Chronic inflammatory airway diseases (CIAD), such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pose a significant threat to public health, with its prognosis closely tied to the body's inflammation level and nutritional status.
As a composite indicator, the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) integrates inflammation and nutritional status.
Despite its potential utility, the link between ALI and the prognosis of patients with CIAD remains unexplored.
This study aimed to investigate this relationship.
