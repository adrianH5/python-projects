The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical driver of prostate cancer (PCa).
To study regulators of AR protein levels and oncogenic activity, we created the first live cell quantitative endogenous AR fluorescent reporters.
Leveraging this novel AR reporter, we performed genome-scale CRISPRi flow cytometry sorting screens to systematically identify genes that modulate AR protein levels.
We identified and validated known AR protein regulators including HOXB13 and GATA2 and also unexpected top hits including PTGES3, a poorly characterized gene in PCa.
PTGES3 repression resulted in loss of AR protein, cell cycle arrest, and cell death in AR-driven PCa models.
PTGES3 is not a commonly essential gene, and our data nominate it as a prime PCa therapeutic target.
Clinically, analysis of PCa data demonstrate that PTGES3 expression is associated with AR-directed therapy resistance.
Mechanistically, we show PTGES3 binds directly to AR, forms a protein complex with AR in the nucleus, regulates AR protein stability
