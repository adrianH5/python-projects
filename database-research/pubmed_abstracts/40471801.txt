Despite advancements in treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in recent decades, many patients still relapse or are refractory to treatment, which represents a high unmet medical need.
Novel CD20 × CD3 T-cell-engaging bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have created a new paradigm for the treatment of B-NHL.
Pivotal studies of four CD20 × CD3 bsAbs, mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, epcoritamab, and odronextamab, as monotherapy, have demonstrated robust responses with generally manageable safety profiles in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after ≥ 2 lines of systemic therapy.
These agents have presented unique challenges (e.g., cytokine release syndrome [CRS]), which have required different strategies to overcome.
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical development of these four CD20 × CD3 bsAbs that have been investigated for the treatment of B-NHL, with a specific focus on translational assessments to select starting doses in first-in-human studies, management of CRS, application of modeling and simulation approaches to aid dose escalation and optimization/selection, and strategies used in the design of phase I-III clinical trials.
By highlighting learnings and experiences from these four bsAbs assessed, which have not been summarized collectively elsewhere, we aim to promote more efficient study design for novel bsAbs in B-NHL in the future.
