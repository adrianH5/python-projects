Breast cancer has now overtaken lung cancer as the "world's leading cancer," yet detecting and implementing effective therapies remains a significant challenge.
Substantial advances have been made in photothermal therapy (PTT), where photosensitizers use photonic energy to induce localized hyperthermia for cancer eradication.
This pioneering approach is gaining traction in clinical settings.
However, traditional PTT faces inherent limitations, including the risk of damage to neighboring healthy tissues and potential inflammatory responses due to overheating.
Drawing inspiration from the distinct characteristics of aggregation-induced emission the small molecule, PM331, was chosen for study.
This donor-acceptor-donor system displays good photothermal conversion efficiencies (40% and 66%) upon excitation at 808 nm and 1,064 nm, respectively.
It is also characterized by attractive optical features in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window.
Using nanoparticles containing PM331,
