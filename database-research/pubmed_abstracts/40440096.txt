The prevalence of lung cancer has increased significantly in recent years.
This malignancy is the most lethal form of tumor and exhibits the highest morbidity and mortality rates among all malignant tumors.
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Although DVT and PE are presentations of VTE at various stages, most PE emboli originate from DVT.
DVT is a severe condition as blood clots produced in the veins can detach and enter the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism.
Lung cancer has the highest incidence of DVT, which is one of the most prevalent preventable causes of hospital-associated death.
The formation of DVT in lung cancer patients is connected to several factors, including anticoagulants, surgery, chemotherapy, genetics and age.
Tissue factors (TFs), platelets, and inflammatory factors have also been reported to play crucial roles.
However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to provide a holistic analysis of the specific mechanisms and treatment of DVT in combination with lung cancer.
This review offers a thorough analysis of the risk factors contributing to DVT formation and coagulation-related substances in cancer patients with DVT, focusing specifically on the mechanisms underlying DVT in lung cancer.
The clinical management of DVT complicated by lung cancer is also discussed.
