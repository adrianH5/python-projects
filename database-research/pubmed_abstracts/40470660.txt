The use of mobile phones, one of the popular recent sources of radio-frequency fields (RFF), is increasing.
It has been shown thatRFF exposure can increase free radical levels and oxidative stress.Obesity is an important risk factor for many diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, and has been shown to increase oxidative stress.
In this study, rats were exposed to 2100 MHz RFF(electric field 15 V/m) for 15 minutes daily and 4 hours daily for 3 weeks.
It aims to investigate the effects of 2100 MHz RFF on brain tissue and plasma of normal and obese rats.
The rats were divided into eight groups (
