T cells play a pivotal role in cancer immunotherapy by recognizing tumor-specific neoantigens presented on HLA molecules, which are specifically expressed on cancer cells.
While neoantigens are generally unique to individual cancers, certain neoantigens, known as 'shared neoantigens' that are common in a subset of cancer patients, represent promising immunotherapeutic targets.
We previously identified an immunogenic shared frameshift neoantigen, 1472SP2, derived from recurrent frameshift indel mutation cluster (APC-F2-1472*) in the
