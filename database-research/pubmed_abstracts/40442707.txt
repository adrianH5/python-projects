Profilin 2 (PFN2), indispensable in all organisms, is important for cancer initiation and progression.
Here, we found PFN2 highly overexpressed in tumor tissues with poor prognosis of Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients had a novel role in remodulating angiogenesis.
However, the mechanism of PFN2-mediated LUAD angiogenesis remains unelucided.
