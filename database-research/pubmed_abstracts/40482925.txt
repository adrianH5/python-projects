The metabolic remodeling occurring in carcinogenesis cells is firmly established.
However, to understand the connection between the cellular metabolic profile and carcinogene sis, an accurate measurement of metabolic fluxes is required.
In order to quantify the fluxes in these metabolic pathways, stable isotopes tracers and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques were employed.
For that purpose, two human non-small lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H1299) were used.
For the quantification of carbon intermediary metabolism cells were grown in
