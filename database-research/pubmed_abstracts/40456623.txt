X-ray microtomography (microCT) represents a modern high-resolution imaging technology enabling detailed analysis of the tissue.
It offers a unique perspective on three-dimensional architecture, bridging the gap between macroscopic and histological imaging.
In anatomical pathology, microCT is particularly utilized for morphometric tumor analysis, evaluation of surgical specimen resection margins, and detection of metastases in lymph nodes.
The combination of microCT with traditional histopathological techniques, and with digital 3D reconstructions, opens new avenues for analyzing complex pathological processes.
Although this method is currently used in research, its clinical potential is significant.
Key advantages include non-invasive imaging and the ability to be integrated with digital pathology and artificial intelligence tools.
Current limitations include the need for sample contrast enhancement, the monochromatic nature of the images, and high radiation exposure.
Advances in technological development, however, may overcome these barriers and enable the broader adoption of microCT in routine clinical diagnostics.
This article explores the diagnostic potential of microCT in pathology, highlighting its applications, advantages, and limitations, while offering insights into current capabilities and future perspectives of this technology.
