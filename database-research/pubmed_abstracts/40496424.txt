Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a significant global mortality burden which particularly affects the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Enhancing diagnostics to identify drug-resistant infections and improving appropriate access to novel Reserve antibiotics in LMICs can address AMR-related morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.
This article characterizes the AMR landscape across 14 LMICs and describes an introductory pathway for novel Reserve antibiotics.
