The unregulated administration of currently available antimicrobial agents resulted in overspreading of resistant microbial phenotypes.
In this study, Mucor racemosus was used for biosynthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) through fungi-based ecofriendly approach.
The biosynthesized of ZnO NPs was initially considered based on analytical practices including UV-vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Additionally, their cytotoxicity and anticancer activity were analyzed using suitable cell lines and their antioxidant effect was also assessed.
Microbiologically, their inhibitory activity was comparatively evaluated against various methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillinsensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
Characterization of ZnO NPs displayed a distinct maximum absorption peak at 320 nm appeared in the UV-vis.
Also, TEM revealed predominantly spherical ZnO NPs with particle size distribution ranging from 15 to 55 nm (mean size ≃ 40 nm).
The normal cell line (Wi-38) illustrated the biosafety of ZnO NPs, where results showed IC
