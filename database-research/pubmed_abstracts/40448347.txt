This paper provides a comprehensive overview of cardiopulmonary events associated with the occurrence, development, and treatment of tumours, serving as a valuable resource for the clinical management of cancer patients.
It explores the complex relationship between the heart and lungs, collectively discussing the cardiopulmonary implications linked to tumours.
Common risk factors that connect tumours with cardiac and pulmonary conditions are delineated, highlighting their direct and indirect correlations.
Additionally, the paper addresses the cardiopulmonary disorders and symptoms resulting from tumour progression and their subsequent manifestations.
The final section focuses on the cardiopulmonary repercussions of various tumour treatments, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, elaborating on their associated cardiopulmonary effects.
Effective management of aggressive proliferative diseases, such as tumours, requires selecting appropriate treatment modalities that balance therapeutic efficacy with vigilant monitoring of cardiopulmonary function and thorough assessment of treatment outcomes and related side effects.
