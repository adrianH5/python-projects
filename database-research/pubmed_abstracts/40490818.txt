Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays well-established roles in cancer cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); however, its role in thyroid carcinoma (TC) remains unclear.
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of TGF-β on EMT in TC and determine its underlying mechanisms.
