Current treatment of metastatic peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM) arising from colorectal cancer (CRC) and appendiceal cancer involves cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) [Elias (J Clin Oncol 28:63-68, 2010), McMullen (Oncotarget 8: 43481-43490, 2017), Lemoine (Int J Hyperthermia 33:582-592, 2017)].
There have been several intraperitoneal (IP) trials of appendix and colon cancer with conflicting results and insufficient evidence regarding both HIPEC efficacy and optimal HIPEC regimens [Quenet (Lancet Oncology 22:256-266, 2021), Arjona-SÃ¡nchez (JAMA Surgery 158:683, 2023), Verwaal (Ann Surg Oncol 12:65-71, 2004), Benzaquen (Can J Surg 64: E111-E118, 2021), Turaga (Ann Surg Oncol 21: 1501-1505, 2014), Nash (J Clin Oncol 41: 160, 2023)].
Given the heterogeneity of prior data and the variability in patient responses to different HIPEC regimens, further research is needed to optimize and personalize treatment.
