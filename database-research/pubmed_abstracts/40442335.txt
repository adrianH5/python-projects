The most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) is caused by intracellular obligate bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) globally.
Many Chlamydia infected women are asymptomatic or only experience minor signs, but others go on to develop salpingitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor infertility.
It's been linked to both the spread of HIV and new infections, and it's suspected of playing a role in the emergence of cervical cancer.
Clinically applicable rapid approaches for timely and precise identification of C. trachomatis infection would provide early treatment, hence reducing the risk of consequences.
Traditional diagnostic methods Cell culture, direct immunofluorescence etc.
are time-consuming but very sensitive assays for C. trachomatis infection.
New and fast diagnostic method includes extraordinary optical transmission (EOT), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF) is more simple, rapid, sensitive, and cost-saving.
This review provides fresh insight into our current understanding of C. trachomatis infection with emphasis on women's health.
We outline a crucial summary of risk factors, molecular and clinical picture, prevention, diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection.
Further, this review provides various modes of treatment, including available vaccination against genital C. trachomatis infection and the future directions to combat this sexually transmitted infection.
