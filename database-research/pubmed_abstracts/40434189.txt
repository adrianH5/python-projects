Pyroptosis-immunotherapy has potential for triple-negative breast cancer treatment, but its efficacy is limited by insufficient pyroptosis activation and the need for phased, balanced, and spatially controlled activation of active species during long-term treatment.
To reconcile intracellular/extracellular demands in tumor ablation, a nanoparticle-hydrogel hybrid enabling spatiotemporal reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulation is engineered.
An open-shell sonosensitizer with unpaired electrons in its molecular orbitals is prepared by chelating Cu
