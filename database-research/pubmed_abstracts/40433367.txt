Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death associated with cancer.
However, the characteristics of ferroptosis in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are still uncertain.
This study aimed to explore the application value of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) classification in prognosis and characteristics prediction to provide clues for targeted SCLC therapy.
