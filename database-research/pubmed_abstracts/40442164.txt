To investigate the prediction of a model constructed by combining machine learning (ML) with clinical features and ultrasound radiomics in the clinical staging of cervical cancer.
General clinical and ultrasound data of 227 patients with cervical cancer who received transvaginal ultrasonography were retrospectively analyzed.
The region of interest (ROI) radiomics profiles of the original image and derived image were retrieved and profile screening was performed.
The chosen profiles were employed in radiomics model and Radscore formula construction.
Prediction models were developed utilizing several ML algorithms by Python based on an integrated dataset of clinical features and ultrasound radiomics.
Model performances were evaluated via AUC.
Plot calibration curves and clinical decision curves were used to assess model efficacy.
The model developed by support vector machine (SVM) emerged as the superior model.
Integrating clinical characteristics with ultrasound radiomics, it showed notable performance metrics in both the training and validation datasets.
Specifically, in the training set, the model obtained an AUC of 0.88 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.83-0.93), alongside a 0.84 accuracy, 0.68 sensitivity, and 0.91 specificity.
When validated, the model maintained an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63-0.88), with 0.77 accuracy, 0.62 sensitivity, and 0.83 specificity.
The calibration curve aligned closely with the perfect calibration line.
Additionally, based on the clinical decision curve analysis, the model offers clinical utility over wide-ranging threshold possibilities.
The clinical- and radiomics-based SVM model provides a noninvasive tool for predicting cervical cancer stage, integrating ultrasound radiomics and key clinical factors (age, abortion history) to improve risk stratification.
This approach could guide personalized treatment (surgery vs. chemoradiation) and optimize staging accuracy, particularly in resource-limited settings where advanced imaging is scarce.
