In this study, we investigated the biochemical mechanisms induced by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in magnetically targeted photodynamic therapy (MT-PDT).
An insight into the underlying oxidative/nitrosative stress mechanism is vital for optimizing treatment protocols, enhancing therapeutic efficacy, and minimizing adverse effects of MT-PDT.
We have synthesized and characterized methylene-blue-loaded cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (MB-SCFNP) and evaluated their MT-PDT efficacy in breast cancer.
