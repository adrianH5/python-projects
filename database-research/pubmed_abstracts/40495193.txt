Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rapidly progressing disease, frequently caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and a higher prevalence in males than females.
Over 60% of HCCs harbour frequent activating mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERTp).
However, the relationship between TERTp status, sex, and expression of specific genes remains poorly understood.
