WAVE1 (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome verprolin-homologous protein family memberÂ 1), a gene associated with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, has been identified as an oncogene with high expression in various tumors and has been linked to metastatic conditions.
Nevertheless, expression pattern of WAVE1 and its function in bladder cancer (BC) remain unknown.
This study aimed to uncover the effect of WAVE1 on migration and metastasis in BC.
In this study, four different human urinary BC cell lines (T24, RT4, J82, and BIU87) were examined using immunohistochemical and Western blot assays to assess the pattern of WAVE1 expression.
Subsequently, the regulatory role of WAVE1 expression in migration, and EMT in the BC cell lines was investigated.
WAVE1 was significantly expressed in the BC tissues
