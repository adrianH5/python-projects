Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumours (IMTs) are rare pulmonary neoplasms, accounting for less than 1% of lung tumours.
Patients present with non-specific symptoms and diverse radiological findings.
A 32-year-old female presented with progressively worsening cough, haemoptysis, low-grade fever and increasing shortness of breath.
Chest X-ray revealed a total right lung collapse.
Further imaging revealed a mass obstructing the right mainstem bronchus.
A staged debulking procedure using rigid bronchoscopy was performed, followed by the insertion of a silicone stent to maintain airway patency.
Endobronchial growth turned out to be an Inflammatory Myofibroblastic tumour.
The patient showed significant improvement in respiratory function and lung re-expansion.
Adjuvant therapy with ALK inhibitor was initiated.
IMTs, while benign histologically, may recur or metastasise, requiring long-term monitoring.
Bronchoscopic interventions offer effective treatment for localised disease, while surgery is preferred for extensive tumours.
Early diagnosis, genetic profiling and a multidisciplinary approach are key for optimal outcomes.
