Cancer is one of the major diseases threatening human health in the world.
According to the latest global cancer statistics from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there were approximately 20 million new cancer cases and 10 million cancer deaths worldwide.
Amidst this global health concern, branched chain amino acids have emerged as key players, playing an important role in the occurrence and development of cancer.
In certain malignancies like colorectal cancer, the average level of BCAA in tumor tissues is twice that in normal tissues.
BCAA metabolism is intricately associated with the progression of multiple tumors and is modulated by diverse enzymes, including BCAT, BCKDH, and BCKDK.
The metabolism of BCAA involves multiple enzymes and biochemical processes via signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AMPK/mTOR, etc.
In addition, mTOR inhibitors show potential value in cancer treatment by regulating the metabolism and signaling pathways of tumor cells, which provides a new direction for anticancer efforts.
Simultaneously, BCAAs are closely associated with tumor immunity, including NK cells, CD4
