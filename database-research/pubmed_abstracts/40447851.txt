Leptomeningeal metastatic disease (LMD) is a severe complication of solid cancers with poor outcomes and limited treatment options.
The antibody-drug conjugate patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) demonstrated efficacy in breast and lung cancers, and HER3 is involved in central nervous system metastases, particularly in parenchymal colonization.
In this study, we investigated HER3-DXd efficacy and safety in patients with LMD in cohort 3 of the TUXEDO-3 phase 2 trial.
Key eligibility criteria included age ≥18 years, treatment-naive LMD or LMD progressing after radiotherapy from any solid tumor and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2.
Between January and July 2024, 20 evaluable patients (nine with type I and 11 with type II LMD) were accrued and received HER3-DXd 5.6 mg kg
