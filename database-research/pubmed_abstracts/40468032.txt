Gastric fundus and cardia cancer are increasingly common, diagnosed at a late stage, often with severe obstruction, and have a poor prognosis.
Transcatheter arterial lipiodol chemoembolization (TACE) is rarely used for gastric cancer.
This single-center retrospective study aimed to analyze the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) combined with TACE in advanced gastric fundus and cardia cancer with obstruction and compare it to bland embolization (BE).
