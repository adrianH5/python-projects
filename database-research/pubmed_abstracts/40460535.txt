With improved systemic disease control, the incidence of brain metastases in patients with cancer is increasing.
Neurosurgical resection is recommended in selected cases, although local control following surgery remains an ongoing concern.
Both fractionated radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) improve local control after surgical resection.
Although postoperative SRS can avoid whole brain radiotherapy-associated toxicity, due to lack of survival and quality of life data, the optimum strategy remains debated.
Furthermore, some cavities may be too large for SRS.
