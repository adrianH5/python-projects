Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women experience inequitable cervical cancer outcomes including higher incidence and mortality rates than other Australian women.
Cervical cancer can be prevented through human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, which is primarily delivered through school immunisation programmes and found to be very effective.
However, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents have lower rates of HPV vaccination uptake compared with non-Indigenous adolescents.
