As a novel cancer treatment method, photothermal therapy (PTT) is considered an up-and-coming candidate for cancer treatment owing to its low invasiveness and ease of implementation.
Nevertheless, single PTT in the first transparency (NIR-I, 750-1000 nm) biowindows is often insufficient to eliminate tumor cells due to light scattering and absorption at the tumor site.
Therefore, the rational design of multifunctional nanocomposites for multimodal combination therapies based on PTT is attractive for improving treatment efficacy while reducing drug resistance and adverse reactions.
Herein, we report a smart multifunctional nanocomposite DOX-Mo
