Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a high mortality rate due to the lack of early-stage detection strategies and lethality of advanced stage presentations.
New-onset diabetes (NOD) in individuals >50 years old increases the risk 6-8-fold, making this group a target of early detection studies.
There is also evidence that deteriorating diabetes (DD) may be a risk factor.
