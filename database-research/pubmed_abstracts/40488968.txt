MYC proteins are potent oncoproteins that drive tumorigenesis in a wide range of cancers, making it critical to understand their oncogenic functions and underlying mechanisms.
Although MYC overexpression induces transcriptional and replication-associated stress, recent studies have paradoxically identified MYC as a key resilience factor that protects cancer cells from these stressors.
In this review, we explore the dual role of MYC in both driving and mitigating cellular stress to achieve its oncogenic function.
We also examine how MYC-induced transcriptional and replicative stress generates potentially immunogenic nucleic acid species while simultaneously helping cancer cells evade host immune recognition.
We propose a model in which MYC plays a critical role in managing the stress it induces, thereby maintaining a balance that promotes tumor growth.
Based on this model, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting MYC-dependent stress responses, offering new avenues for cancer treatment and highlighting the complexity of MYC-driven oncogenesis.
