Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy comprising 10% of hematologic cancers, associated with bone marrow dysfunction and organ damage.
High-risk cytogenetic MM patients, identified by specific genetic abnormalities, face poor outcomes despite recent advancements.
Traditional treatments often prove inadequate, necessitating novel regimens.
This review assesses the efficacy of emerging therapies-next-generation proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and CD38-targeting agents-aimed at improving outcomes for this patient subset.
