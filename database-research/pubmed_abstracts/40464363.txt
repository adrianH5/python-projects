Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently a global health burden, with staggering worldwide prevalence.
CRC is ranked as the third most common and second deadliest cancer worldwide.
With rising life expectancy population growth, CRC incidence and mortality are projected to increase, particularly among individuals under 50.
This underscores the need to improve early detection of CRC.
Although colonoscopy remains the preferred diagnostic technique, due to its high sensitivity and specificity for CRC its invasive nature and cost result in low adherence rates.
Consequently, the scientific community is actively exploring alternative diagnostic methods, primarily through biomarkers, molecules exhibiting dysregulated levels associated with specific diseases.
Lipidomics has become crucial in cancer research, as lipids play key roles in metabolic pathways driving cancer development.
Recent investigations have revealed decreased levels of lipid classes such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in CRC patients compared to healthy controls, alongside an increase in specific sphingolipid species across multiple studies.
In the context of CRC progression, triglycerides (TGs) stand out as the lipids that display the most pronounced differentiation among different disease stages.
These lipid dysregulations present promising avenues for identifying potential therapeutic targets and innovative diagnostic methods, however, a comprehensive understanding of these processes requires further exploration.
