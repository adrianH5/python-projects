As a drug delivery vehicle, liposomes still have problems such as lack of targeting, difficulty in achieving effective tumor tissue penetration, and cellular internalization.
Based on this, the drug-loaded liposome nanomotors with liposomes that can respond to NO degradation as carriers and loaded with anticancer drug DOX were designed for the treatment of peritoneal metastases cancer (arginine-functionalized-DSPE@NO-responsive-lipids-DOX, l-Arg@Lip-DOX).
The drug-loaded liposomal nanomotors have the ability to move toward tumors at high concentrations of ROS/iNOS, thereby achieving deep penetration and effective cellular internalization of tumor tissues.
In addition, the guanidine group on the nanomotors can react with ROS/iNOS highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment to produce NO, which promotes the degradation of drug-loaded liposomal nanomotors and the rapid release of anticancer drug DOX.
Further in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the nanomotors can achieve good therapeutic effects, providing a design idea for the treatment of peritoneal metastases and providing a promising candidate material for the delivery system of cancer treatment drugs.
