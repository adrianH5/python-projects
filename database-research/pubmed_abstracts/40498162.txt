Postoperative complications in colorectal surgery can significantly impact patient outcomes and healthcare costs.
Accurate prediction of these complications enables targeted perioperative management, improving patient safety and optimizing resource allocation.
This study evaluates the application of machine learning (ML) models, particularly deep learning neural networks (DLNN), in predicting postoperative complications following laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for colon cancer.
