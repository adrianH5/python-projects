The prevalence of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in India ranges from 34% to 60%.
The prognosis for DLBCL can vary widely depending on various factors, including vitamin D deficiency.
Research suggests that low vitamin D levels may be linked to poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in DLBCL patients.
Additionally, polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, specifically the BsmI and TaqI alleles, have been significantly associated with disease prognosis.
However, the association of VDR polymorphisms and vitamin D deficiency with DLBCL is yet to be explored.
Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the association of VDR gene polymorphisms (BsmI, TaqI, FokI, ApaI) in DLBCL patients.
