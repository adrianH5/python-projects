The hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacts the effectiveness of various therapies on breast cancer.
Conventional chemotherapeutic agents are unable to target hypoxic tumor tissue specifically, leading to reduced treatment efficacy and severe systemic toxicity.
In order to improve drug targeting ability, we developed a bioactive biomotors system (MDPP@Bif) for chemoimmunotherapy against breast cancer.
Utilizing the self-driving properties of the anaerobic
