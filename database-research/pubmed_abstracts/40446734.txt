Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is one of deubiquitinases and has been reported to regulate cancer cell biological processes through removing ubiquitin modifications from protein substrates.
Myosins of class VI (MYO6) is shown to be highly expressed in many of cancers, and is associated with tumor progression in several cancers by affecting cell survival.
Moreover, USP7 and MYO6 have been revealed to be involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression.
Here, we aimed to investigate the intricate interplay between MYO6 and USP7 in CRC, and whether their interaction was associated with deubiquitination.
