SMARCA-4 deficient cutaneous tumor is extremely uncommon.
These are aggressive tumors to begin with, and should be recognised at the outset from their extremely high-grade morphology and absence or extreme paucity of not only usual carcinoma markers but also complete absence of SMARCA-4, which should be performed.
We present such a case with extensive metastases, notable for relatively quite small size of primary skin lesion.
The case must be evaluated in full to rule out systemic including thoraco-visceral disease.
