Insufficient blood supply to free jejunal grafts after total pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy (TPLE) occurs primarily due to failure of the vascular anastomosis, often resulting in rapid graft necrosis.
This report details a case of ischemic enteritis caused by an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the mesentery of the free jejunal graft, resulting in chronic stenosis and total removal of the jejunal graft.
