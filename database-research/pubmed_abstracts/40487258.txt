Melanoma is one of the most common types of skin cancer with an annually increasing mortality rate.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an imperative role as a cancer biomarker in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin and thromboxane during inflammatory reactions.
Its overexpression has been demonstrated in various cancer types, including melanoma.
However, its clinicopathological association with melanoma is controversial.
We aimed to immunohistochemically evaluate COX-2 expression in malignant melanoma (MM) tumors.
