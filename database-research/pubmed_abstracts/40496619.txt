Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is among the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer worldwide, largely due to the lack of early symptoms and frequent late-stage diagnosis.
G protein Î³ subunit 7 (GNG7) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration across various cancers.
However, its immunological role in LUAD progression remains poorly understood.
