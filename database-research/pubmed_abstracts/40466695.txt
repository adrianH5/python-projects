This cross-sectional study enrolled 70 women aged 18-40 years in Baqubah City (Iraq), from September to November 2024.
Participants were divided into two age-matched groups: a control group (n=35, healthy nulliparous women) and a patient group (n=35, physician-diagnosed breast cancer cases).
Blood samples were collected from both groups, processed via centrifugation, and analyzed for key biochemical markers, including the tumor antigen CA15-3, apelin, sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, etc.
), and essential minerals (e.g., calcium, zinc).
Statistical analysis revealed highly significant differences (p â‰¤ 0.001) in serum biomarker levels between breast cancer patients and controls.
Elevated CA15-3 and altered apelin concentrations were observed in cancer patients, alongside dysregulated sex hormones and mineral imbalances.
These findings underscore the potential diagnostic utility of these biomarkers in breast cancer and highlight metabolic disruptions associated with the disease.
Further research is warranted to validate their clinical applicability.
