Fistulae can severely impact a patient's quality of life, causing physical pain and excessive malodorous discharge.
Beyond the physical symptoms, they also impose significant psychological and social burdens.
This report presents a unique case involving the intravenous administration of a single dose of infliximab to a terminally ill patient with rectal adenocarcinoma complicated by severe enterocutaneous fistulae in the genital, subscrotal, and gluteal regions.
This home-based intervention not only improved the patient's quality of life but also alleviated caregiver burdens and facilitated the timely completion of end-of-life tasks.
