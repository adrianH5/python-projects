A metamaterial integrated applicator operating at 2.45 GHz has been developed for focused heating in clinical hyperthermia applications, effectively heating tumors while minimizing surface hot spots.
This innovative applicator combines a double spiral antenna (DSA) for energy delivery, a spiral frequency selective surface (SFSS) for focused energy distribution, and an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) as a reflector to enhance penetration and uniformity.
To ensure durability and environmental protection, the entire structure, including the DSA, SFSS, and AMC, is encased in a Teflon layer.
The applicator's performance is evaluated using heterogeneous phantoms, the Gustav Voxel model, and head tissue-simulating liquid, replicating real-world conditions.
Its thermal efficiency is further analyzed with a water bolus that includes a 1 mm polyvinyl chloride (PVC) layer to safeguard superficial tissues and enable uniform heat distribution.
The applicator achieves a therapeutic temperature of 44 °C in tumors with just 3 W of input power, demonstrating exceptional efficiency.
Impedance matching and resonance at 2.45 GHz ensure effective energy delivery to target tissues.
Specific absorption rate (SAR) measurements at 0.1 W input confirm consistent energy distribution across varying depths.
The strong alignment between simulation and experimental results validates the applicator's design, making it a reliable and precise tool for hyperthermia therapy.
