Medulloblastoma (MB) treatment includes surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy (CT).
Cisplatin-based regimens for standard-risk (SR) MB are effective but associated with significant toxicities, particularly ototoxicity.
This study compares the toxicity profiles of two CT regimens, focusing on grade ≥ 3 ototoxicity, hematologic, hepatic, renal, and neurologic toxicities.
