We report a neoteric study that accentuates the effectiveness of substrate-less molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) block acting as probe in detecting a carcinogenic food preservative, formalin (FOL).
FOL is generally mixed with consumable products to increase their shelf-life.
However, its ingestion has exposed human health to severe illnesses, comparable to chronic cancer.
Present study demonstrates FOL detection through phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) alongside MIP.
The LSPR spectra arising from the attributes of embedded NP's are recorded to characterize the MIP probe.
There exists a wide linear range (R
