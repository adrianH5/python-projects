Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer has high recurrence rates and its frequent treatment can become a burden for both the patient and healthcare professionals.
Recent treatment advances have focused on lessening the invasiveness of treatment options through laser ablation and outpatient resection.
Several randomized controlled trials have highlighted the efficacy of laser ablation for small bladder tumor recurrences, however outpatient tumor resection techniques that allow for histopathological analysis remain unstudied.
