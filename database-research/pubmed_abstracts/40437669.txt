The isatuximab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (Isa-Pd) regimen has shown survival benefits for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in several trials, while evidence of effectiveness and safety among Chinese patients is limited.
This study aim to provide real-world evidence of Isa-Pd in Chinese patients with RRMM.
