Scoliosis affects up to 5% of the population, and early detection is crucial to prevent progression and surgical intervention.
X-ray imaging remains the standard for scoliosis assessment, but repeated exposure to ionizing radiation increases cancer risks, particularly in pediatric patients.
This study evaluates bone-enhanced 3D ultrasound (BEUS) as a non-ionizing alternative for scoliosis measurement.
