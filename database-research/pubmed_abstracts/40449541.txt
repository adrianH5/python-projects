The prognostic role of systemic inflammatory biomarkers in patients with chondrosarcoma remains unclear, and evidence is lacking.
The modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) is an inflammation-based prognostic score consisting of preoperative CRP and albumin.
This has been validated for a number of carcinomas and soft-tissue sarcoma, where its use is recommended.
This national multicentre study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of preoperative systemic inflammatory biomarkers, primarily the mGPS, in the prediction of survival in patients with a chondrosarcoma.
