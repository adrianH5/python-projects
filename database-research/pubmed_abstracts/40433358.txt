Tumor immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, particularly through the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 axis.
While PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is an established predictive biomarker for therapeutic response, emerging evidence highlights the importance of PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells, both in the periphery and within the tumor microenvironment (TME).
This study explores the immunomodulatory effects of the selective HDAC6 inhibitor ITF3756 on monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs).
