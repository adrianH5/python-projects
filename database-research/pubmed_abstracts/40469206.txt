Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignancy that originates from the epithelial cells of the biliary system.
Despite advancements in medical diagnostic techniques, CCAs remain a challenge to detect due to their silent clinical progression, making it difficult to diagnose these diseases.
There are several well-established risk factors for CCA, including biliary tract infection and inflammation.
However, there is also growing evidence that community and occupational exposures play a significant role in the development of bile duct cancers.
This review examines the geographical distribution of these risk factors and the importance of surveillance in individuals exposed to these toxins who are more prone to developing CCA.
