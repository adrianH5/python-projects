Metastasis plays a significant role in the high mortality rates associated with cancer and is usually the endpoint of a series of sequential and dynamic events.
A crucial step in metastasis development and progression is the formation of a premetastatic niche (PMN), which provides a conducive microenvironment for the settlement and colonization of disseminated tumor cells at distant metastatic sites.
Extensive research has demonstrated the significance of macrophage populations within primary tumors in promoting metastatic progression.
Nevertheless, the contribution of macrophages at secondary sites to the regulation of PMN formation is frequently overlooked.
This review systematically explores the role of macrophages in priming the PMN to facilitate cancer metastasis.
Additionally, we provide a compendium of existing strategies to target macrophages in cancer therapy.
