Traditional chemical interventions regulate cellular processes but often affect non-target biomolecules.
Precise and site-specific control is crucial for studying complex systems.
Conventional laser-based methods offer high spatial precision and speed but rely on prior sample knowledge and do not apply to highly mobile targets.
Real-time precision opto-control (RPOC) overcomes these limits using closed-loop feedback for automated and signal-determined real-time laser activation to regulate chemical processes in live biological samples.
This review compares RPOC with other optical control techniques and explores its advancements, applications, and future directions.
