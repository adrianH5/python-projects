Active learning methodologies, such as case-based learning (CBL), are widely used in undergraduate medical education.
CBL is associated with high student satisfaction, knowledge acquisition and the development of critical thinking abilities.
The aim of this review is to determine whether these findings are generalisable to postgraduate medical oncology trainees.
A systematic review was conducted using Medline and Embase, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines.
Studies were evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and a narrative synthesis without meta-analysis was completed to summarise findings.
There is a lack of published data in this area.
Three studies were eligible for review: one randomised controlled trial (RCT), one qualitative study and one educational pilot.
Two studies were based in the UK and one study was based in China.
In total, there were 111 participants and studies were published between 2012 and 2024.
Studies universally demonstrated CBL was viewed positively by practicing doctors.
Further findings included CBL being associated with perceived increases in confidence, learning and examination results.
There were no reported negative aspects of CBL.
All three studies had significant methodological flaws limiting the validity and reliability of stated findings.
There is a lack of robust data in this field; however, the available evidence supports findings from the undergraduate setting, namely CBL is valued by trainees.
Further studies are required to demonstrate whether CBL courses are feasible within speciality training programmes and whether they benefit trainee performance.
