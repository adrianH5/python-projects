Preventive medicine is one of the core elements of primary care physicians' (PCPs) work.
This includes screening for cancer (such as Mammography and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) for breast and colon cancer) and also screening for chronic conditions (like bone density scans (DEXA scans) for osteoporosis).
In recent years, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telemedicine increased dramatically.
This study aimed to identify the rate of preventative medicine referrals and performance in individuals who mostly had face-to-face encounters compared to those who mostly had remote encounters.
