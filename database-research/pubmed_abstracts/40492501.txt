Cancer treatment is often ineffective due to poor bioimaging and resistance to standard therapies.
This issue is exacerbated by multiple low-penetrable bio-barriers that limit the theranostic agents' effectiveness in tumors.
Here, a hollow nanomotor PM-HMSN/Arg is fabricated by a sequential process involving: electrostatic adsorption of Mn
