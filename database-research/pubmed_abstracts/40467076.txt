Metastatic spread of breast cancer to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is uncommon.
When it does occur, it is typically associated with invasive lobular carcinoma and most often involves the stomach and intestinal wall, though the colon may be involved in rare instances.
We present a unique case of metastatic breast cancer diagnosed via a colonic polyp found during routine screening colonoscopy.
This case illustrates an unusual presentation of metastatic breast cancer.
