BackgroundChemotherapy is a well-known treatment modality against cancer.
Occupational exposure to chemotherapy and related adverse effects are widely reported.
Safe handling is vital in the reduction of possible risks.ObjectiveTo assess perceptions of occupational exposure and adherence to safety measures of handling Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) among nurses.MethodsA phenomenological study was carried out using a semi-structured, in-depth interviewer guide following the Health Belief Model (HBM) components.
The study adopted a purposive sampling method, and data was collected until it reached the saturation point.
A thematic analysis was carried out, preserving the study's trustworthiness.ResultsThe nurse's main role was to administer chemotherapy.
The primary learning sources were clinical experience and follow-up with seniors.
Nurses accept that they are occupationally exposed to chemotherapy and believe that safety measures are protective against exposure.
Surgical gloves and masks were common PPE, and chemotherapy-specific masks and gowns were mainly used in mixing drugs.
Staffing, safe work practices, separate waste disposal, and seniors' guidance are identified as protective measures.
Headache, vomiting, hair loss, skin irritation, and miscarriages were commonly perceived as adverse effects of handling SACT.ConclusionsAn increased patient count, frequent complex doses, a lack of PPE and facilities, and discomfort with PPE might increase exposure.
