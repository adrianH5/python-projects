A number of X-ray repair cross complementing group (XRCC) genes are found to be involved in the DNA repair by the repair of single strand breaks (SSBs).
Variation in these genes may lead to variation in DNA repair capacity, thereby increasing the genetic susceptibility to numerous human cancers.
Among the known genetic polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, there are many functional genetic variants have been identified in the XRCC genes particularly XRCC4, XRCC5, XRCC6 and XRCC7 that shows the positive association with the multiple cancers including cancers of GI tract.
Therefore, in the present study, polymorphic variants of XRCC4, XRCC5, XRCC6 and XRCC7 were chosen to be studied in association with gastrointestinal cancer susceptibility in the south western Maharashtrian population.
Methods: A total of 200 histologically confirmed cases of gastrointestinal cancer (GI) and 200 hospital-based controls were included in the study.
The genotyping for XRCC4, XRCC5, XRCC6 and XRCC7 genes was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
