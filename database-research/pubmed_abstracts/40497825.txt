Computed Tomography (CT) is widely acknowledged as the gold standard for diagnosing thoracic diseases.
However, the accuracy of interpretation significantly depends on radiologists' expertise.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable promise in various medical applications, particularly in radiology.
This study aims to assess the performance of leading LLMs in analyzing unstructured chest CT reports and to examine how different questioning methodologies and fine-tuning strategies influence their effectiveness in enhancing chest CT diagnosis.
