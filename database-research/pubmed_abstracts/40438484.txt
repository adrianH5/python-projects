Epithelioid sarcoma is an uncommon mesenchymal malignancy which represents less than 1% of all sarcomas.
Rarer still are reports of this tumor initially presenting in the vulva.
We report a case of vulvar proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma.
A 52-year-old had a 5-month history of slowly growing papule on the right labia majora.
Excision of the mass revealed a tumor composed of large polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
An immunohistochemistry panel revealed cytokeratin AE1/AE3 positivity only.
She underwent radical vulvectomy with bilateral groin node dissection.
The specimen revealed a cream tan, firm, fairly defined mass at the right vulva.
Microscopic examination showed a sheet-like growth pattern of large pleomorphic epithelioid cells with large vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli.
The tumor showed loss of INI1 nuclear expression and absence of CD34 staining.
EMA was positive.
The case was signed out as proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma of the right vulva.
Two months post-operatively, the patient was given concurrent chemotherapy with 5 cycles of cisplatin 40 mg/m
