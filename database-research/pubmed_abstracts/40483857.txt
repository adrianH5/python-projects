Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is an important method for cardiovascular risk assessment.
While artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to automate CAC scoring in calcium scoring computed tomography (CSCT), its application to low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans, typically used for lung cancer screening, remains challenging due to the lower image quality and higher noise levels of LDCT.
