Pancreatic signet ring cell carcinoma (PSRCC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of pancreatic cancer, with a poor prognosis and limited evidence on the survival benefit of chemotherapy.
From the perspective of conditional survival (CS) prognosis, this study sought to assess the effect of chemotherapy on PSRCC survival and to construct a predictive model integrating CS analysis.
