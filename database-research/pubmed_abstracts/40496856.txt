Myasthenia gravis (MG) and connective tissue diseases (CTD) are both B-cell-mediated, antibody-associated autoimmune diseases that share similar mechanisms of immune dysfunction.
The coexistence of MG and CTD is a rare phenomenon, and its management remains challenging.
Here, we report three cases of coexisting MG and CTD-specifically systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and all three patients presented significant improvement 4 weeks after initiation of treatment with telitacicept.
Minimal symptom expression (MSE) was achieved after 4, 6, and 7 weeks of treatment with telitacicept, for patients one-to-three, respectively.
This therapy also enabled a reduction in prednisone dosage, with clinical symptoms of CTD remaining well controlled.
These findings present preliminary evidence supporting Telitacicept as an effective treatment and a double-target therapy for the management of MG-CTD.
