S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) is the vital component of the Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which precisely regulates CDK inhibitors by coordinating with Cks1 and has been identified to be involved in the progression of many human malignancies.
Inspired by our previous study, we designed novel 2,3-diarylpyrazine derivatives via molecular hybridization strategy to enhance Skp2-Cks1 inhibition.
Compound 10h emerged as the most potent inhibitor, displaying an IC
