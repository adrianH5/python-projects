This article describes an uncommon clinical case of a 71-year-old patient diagnosed with pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma, which presented as a significant pulmonary embolism complicated with acute cor pulmonale.
The diagnosis was confirmed via histological and immunohistochemical examination, verifying the tumor's mesenchymal characteristics.
This article underscores the criticality of early detection and timely surgical intervention when a malignant pulmonary artery tumor is detected, as it poses a substantial risk to the patient's life.
Given that these rare cancers can mimic more common illnesses like pulmonary embolism in their symptoms, this instance emphasizes the difficulties in detecting them.
Appropriate diagnosis and treatment depend on early detection by sophisticated imaging and histological confirmation.
