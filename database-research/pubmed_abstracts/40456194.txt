Despite the use of therapeutic modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, breast cancer remains a potentially fatal condition for humans.
The primary problems with these treatments are their low efficacy and their inevitable side effects to the surrounding healthy tissues.
Overcoming these challenges has been achieved through precision therapeutics, where personalized interventions have significantly improved treatment efficacy.
However, the development of nanoparticles has largely remained focused on optimizing delivery platforms based on a one-size-fits-all approach.
As lipid-based, polymeric, and inorganic nanoparticles are now being engineered with greater specificity, they are increasingly suited for customization-paving the way for truly personalized drug delivery in the era of precision medicine.
In this line, the current study focuses on breast cancer, and recent developments in drug delivery.
The first part of this review looks at practical difference between precision medicine and precision targeting.
It describes breast cancer signaling pathways, highlighting the exciting potential of nanotechnology in cancer drug delivery using precision targeting - an approach closely linked to precision medicine.
We also go over how nanostructures can improve the way drugs, genes, and immunotherapy are delivered in the treatment of breast cancer.
Lastly, we discuss challenges, solutions, future directions, and possibilities for the practical use of nanotechnology in the treatment of breast cancer, while introducing nano-products based on clinical trials.
