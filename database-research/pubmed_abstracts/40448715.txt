Surgical video review (SVR) is an emerging tool for assessing patient outcomes, especially in complex surgeries such as robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN).
Adhesive probability and morphological scores are used to evaluate fat management and warm ischemia, respectively; however, the factors influencing renal hilum control (RHC) during RAPN have not yet been assessed.
The aim of this study is to use SVR to identify the renal vascular patterns and factors that influence RHC.
