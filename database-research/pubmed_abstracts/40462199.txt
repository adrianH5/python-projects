Thresholds for clinical importance (TCIs) were previously established for the cancer-specific patient reported outcome (PRO) measures EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ CAT Core, and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL.
TCIs aim to aid the interpretation of scores for individual patients at a single point in time.
They intend to indicate whether a symptom or functional health limitation is of clinical relevance, i.e., requires to be discussed with healthcare professionals.
In this systematic scoping review, we aimed to describe the uptake of TCIs by the research community and discuss opportunities and threats in their application to PRO data.
