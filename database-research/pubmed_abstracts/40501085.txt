Marine fungi are the leading producers of bioactive metabolites with medicinal properties against several diseases.
However, since marine species survive in diverse climates, they are usually difficult to culture in laboratory setups, making them challenging to study.
This study aimed to optimize culture conditions for marine fungi and evaluate the inhibitory action of the marine extract on primary pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Culture conditions for marine fungi were optimized using biomass production, hyphal density, and radial extension, considering temperature and humidity.
The study isolated a new
