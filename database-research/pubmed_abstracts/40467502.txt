The poor prognosis of lung cancer during pregnancy requires complicated management.
A 40-year-old woman at 25 weeks' gestation was admitted with persistent back pain.
Imaging findings suggested lung cancer.
A multidisciplinary team determined that early intervention was crucial, and Caesarean delivery was performed at 27 weeks' gestation.
Thereafter, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastasis.
The patient underwent rapid opioid titration and radiation therapy for the bone metastases.
We then introduced chemotherapy and offered an advanced care plan.
A multidisciplinary approach is essential for pregnant women with lung cancer.
Early delivery is recommended to expedite the diagnosis and treatment.
