Uremic pruritus (UP) is a prevalent and debilitating condition experienced by patients undergoing hemodialysis, influenced by multiple underlying mechanisms.
Despite the availability of various treatment options, many patients still endure significant pruritus.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to assess and compare the safety and efficacy of mirtazapine and hydroxyzine in treating UP and improving sleep quality in hemodialysis patients.
