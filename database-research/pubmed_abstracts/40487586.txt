Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a frequent complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.
Most patients achieve complete symptom resolution without long-term neurological sequelae, yet the impact of ICANS and steroid therapy on oncological outcomes remains inadequately explored.
We investigated the association between ICANS and steroid therapy with progression-free survival (PFS).
