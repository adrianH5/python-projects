Neuropsychiatric complications of cancer cachexia include apathy.
Zhu et al.
identified a brain circuit sensitive to tumor-driven interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling that directly reduces motivation by suppressing dopaminergic activity.
Targeted circuit-based and pharmacologic interventions, including systemic anti-IL-6 antibodies, reversed motivational deficits and point to new therapeutic avenues for apathy.
