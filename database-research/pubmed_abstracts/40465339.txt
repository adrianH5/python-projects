Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy constitutes a vital medical intervention primarily aimed at enhancing oxygen delivery.
Furthermore, RBCs possess the ability to stably bind therapeutic gas molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO).
As natural gas carriers, RBCs have the potential to mitigate the non-specific gas release and biosafety issues associated with conventional gas donors, which currently hinder the clinical application of gas therapy.
In this study, RBCs are innovatively engineered for amplified tumor dual-gas transfusion therapy.
The RBCs delivering CO and NO are developed using advanced nano- and gas-engineering techniques.
These engineered RBCs are activated by tumor cell-specificÂ hydrogen peroxide (H
