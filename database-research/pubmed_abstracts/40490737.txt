Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the world's most widely used weed control agents.
Public health concerns have increased since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015.
To further investigate the health effects of glyphosate and GBHs, the Ramazzini Institute launched the Global Glyphosate Study (GGS), which is designed to test a wide range of toxicological outcomes.
Reported here are the results of the carcinogenicity arm of the GGS.
