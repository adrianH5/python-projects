Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is prone to recurrence following hepatectomy, posing significant clinical challenges.
Our previous research suggested that adoptive T-cell therapy could improve the impaired liver microenvironment.
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant RetroNectin-Activated Killer (RAK) cell therapy to prevent the recurrence of HCC post-hepatectomy in high-risk patients and explore potential mechanisms.
