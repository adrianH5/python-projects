EF-hand domain family member D1 (EFHD1) is a novel mitochondrial regulator.
EFHD1 has been reported in the progression of many types of cancer, such as osteosarcoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and colorectal cancer.
Our study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of EFHD1 in breast cancer (BRCA).
