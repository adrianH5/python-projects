Breast cancer progression and metastasis involve the action of multiple transcription factors in tumors and in the cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and understanding how these transcription factors are coordinated can guide novel therapeutic strategies.
Myocardin-related transcription factors A and B (MRTFA/B also known as MKL1/2) are two related transcription factors that redundantly control cancer cell invasion and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer, but their roles in human cancer are incompletely understood.
Here, we investigated the expression and activation of these transcription factors to better assess their tumorigenic and metastatic impact on breast cancer and cells of the tumor microenvironment.
