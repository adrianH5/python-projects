Gastric cancer ranks as the fifth most common human cancer worldwide and has a poor survival rate and limited treatment options.
Despite the high prevalence and mortality rate, the genetic etiology is largely unknown.
In dogs, a clinically and histologically similar disease disproportionately affects two breeds, the Belgian Tervuren and Belgian Sheepdog, which develop the intestinal and diffuse tumor subtypes observed in humans.
We performed a Bayesian genome-wide association study and selection analyses in this naturally occurring canine model to elucidate underlying genetic risk factors for gastric cancer and identified 15 associated loci.
Variant filtering revealed germline putative regulatory variants for the
