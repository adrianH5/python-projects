Natural killer (NK) cells in mice and humans are key effectors of the innate immune system with complex immunoregulatory functions, and diverse subsets have been identified with distinct characteristics and roles.
Companion dogs with spontaneous cancer have been validated as models of human disease, including cancer immunology and immunotherapy, and greater understanding of NK cell heterogeneity in dogs can inform NK biology across species and optimize NK immunotherapy for both dogs and people.
