Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition associated with cutaneous and neoplastic manifestations and other physical manifestations, as well as cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioural difficulties.
NF1 negatively impacts the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children.
There is limited evidence regarding the determinants of HRQoL of children with NF1.
The aim of this study was to (i) compare the HRQoL of children with NF1 and cognitive impairments to published data of healthy children and children with cancer and (ii) identify specific determinants of child and parent-proxy reports of psychosocial HRQoL.
