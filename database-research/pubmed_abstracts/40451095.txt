Radiomic features, derived from a region of interest (ROI) in medical images, are valuable as prognostic factors.
Selecting an appropriate ROI is critical, and many recent studies have focused on leveraging multiple ROIs by segmenting analogous regions across patients - such as the primary tumour and peritumoral area or subregions of the tumour.
These can be straightforwardly incorporated into models as additional features.
However, a more complex scenario arises, for example, in a regionally disseminated disease, when multiple distinct lesions are present.
