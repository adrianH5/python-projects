Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs) are aggressive liver tumors with high heterogeneity and limited therapeutic options.
Although traditionally thought to arise from biliary cells, recent findings suggest that hepatocytes may also serve as a cellular origin for ICC.
However, the mechanisms underlying hepatocyte malignant transformation and ICC initiation remain poorly understood.
