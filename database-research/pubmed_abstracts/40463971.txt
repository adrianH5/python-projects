Stroke often leads to functional impairment in patients and carries a risk of recurrence.
Therefore, it is crucial for post-stroke patients to proactively pursue self-management behaviors that foster functional recovery and prevent recurrent strokes, such as keeping a balanced diet or exercising.
The implementation of self-management behaviors requires the combined influence of internal and external factors, which have not been fully explored.
This study aimed to investigate the level of self-management behaviors in post-stroke patients and to explore the impact of chronic illness resources, fear of recurrence, hope, and health locus of control on these behaviors.
