Modeling hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in Alaska Native (AN) peoples with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is important for risk stratification and surveillance.
Existing HCC risk prediction models use baseline characteristics ascertained at the time of HBV diagnosis, rather than predicting HCC risk within 5 years of a relevant time point (such as a clinic visit), and do not include the HBV genotype (GT).
We aimed to develop an HCC risk prediction model that addresses these limitations.
