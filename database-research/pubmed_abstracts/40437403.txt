Cervical cancer remains a significant global health issue, with accurate differentiation between low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) crucial for effective screening and management.
Current methods, such as Pap smears and HPV testing, often fall short in sensitivity and specificity.
Deep learning models hold the potential to enhance the accuracy of cervical cancer screening but require thorough evaluation to ascertain their practical utility.
