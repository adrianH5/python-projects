Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely recognized tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and yolk sac tumors.
Alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) is a rare but highly malignant subtype of gastric cancer associated with poor prognosis.
It is characterized by AFP positivity detected in serum or immunohistochemical staining, may along with hepatocellular differentiation.
In recent years, advancements in molecular biology and therapeutic agents have led to a deeper understanding of AFPGC.
However, the mechanisms underlying its tumorigenesis and invasive metastasis remain unclear.
This article summarizes the traits of AFP, its clinicopathological features, and therapeutic strategies for AFP-positive gastric cancer, providing a better understanding and reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of AFPGC.
