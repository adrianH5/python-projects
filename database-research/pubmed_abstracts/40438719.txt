The field of gastroenterology has experienced revolutionary advances over the past years, as flexible endoscopes have become widely accessible.
In addition to enabling faster, less invasive, and more affordable treatment, flexible endoscopes have greatly improved the detection and endoscopic screening of malignancies and prevented many cancer-related deaths.
The development and clinical application of new diagnostic endoscopic technologies, such as magnification endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy, and more recently, artificial intelligence enhanced technologies, have made the recognition and detection of various neoplasms and sub-epithelial tumors more possible.
This review demonstrates the latest advancements in endoscopic procedures, techniques, and devices applied in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal cancer.
