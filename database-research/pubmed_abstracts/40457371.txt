Oral health is an important component of cancer care that is often neglected, particularly in low-resource settings.
Cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy have the potential to significantly enhance the risk of oral complications that severely affect the quality of life for patients.
This study is aimed to evaluate the oral health awareness, self-care practices, and lived experiences of cancer patients in Ethiopia.
