Intestinal diseases are highly prevalent, affecting millions worldwide and significantly contributing to global morbidity.
The treatment of complex disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), remains challenging due to multifactorial etiologies, diverse patient responses, and the limitations of current therapeutic strategies.
Although the gut microbiota clearly plays a role in regulating the onset of intestinal diseases, few studies have explored the epigenetic factors by which the microbiota contributes to disease development.
Here, the latest insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional influence between gut microbiota and epigenetic modifications are discussed, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and
