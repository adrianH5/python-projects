GX-I7 (rhIL-7-hyFc, efineptakin alfa) is a hybrid Fc-fused long-acting interleukin-7 (IL-7) with the aim of correcting T-cell deficiency, thereby strengthening the immune response to fight against cancer.
This Phase 1b, dose-escalation study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GX-I7 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours.
