The connection between humans and Nature's chemistry is astonishing and built into the very fabric of our genetic code.
In this Perspective, we focus on bioactive molecules from microbes, plants, and animals that transformed our health and society and continue to change the course of human history.
In light of our changing planet and recent public distrust in science, our intimate connection with Nature and its solutions to our problems are in peril.
It has never been more important to invest new effort into understanding the mysteries of life's molecules to preserve our own existence.
