Breast cancer has become one of the most prevalent malignant neoplasms among women, poses a significant threat to public health.
As a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins, CD151 is implicated in tumor progression and has been shown to regulate various cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive malignancy.
However, the specific functions of CD151 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unclear.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the pro-tumorigenic role of CD151 in TNBC by focusing on its interaction with integrin α3β1, which often forms a complex with CD151.
