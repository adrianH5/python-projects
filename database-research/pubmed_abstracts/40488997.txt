Asprosin is a versatile protein hormone primarily produced by white adipose tissue (WAT).
When secreted into the bloodstream, it exerts a range of central and peripheral effects, positioning it as a key player in metabolic processes.
Since its discovery, asprosin has garnered increasing attention for its involvement in metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation, both of which are critical to reproductive health.
Emerging evidence indicates that asprosin influences the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, a key neuroendocrine system regulating mammalian reproduction.
Concurrently, clinical studies have revealed dysregulated asprosin expression in various reproductive diseases, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and pregnancy-related disorders such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia.
These findings suggest that asprosin plays a crucial role in reproductive events and infertility-related conditions.
This review provides an overview of the latest research on asprosin's role in reproduction, female reproductive diseases, and pregnancy complications, while also outlining potential future research directions.
A deeper understanding of asprosin's complex involvement in reproduction and reproductive-endocrine disorders could offer novel insights into its potential as a therapeutic target for addressing infertility in clinical settings.
