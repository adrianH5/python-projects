Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is limited in treatment options due to the absence of three receptors, and evidence suggests that TNBC is sensitive to ferroptosis.
In this study, a series of genipin derivatives were synthesized through a hybridization strategy that integrated the structures of RSL3 and ML162.
Among these derivatives, compound B23 demonstrated remarkable activity against the MDA-MB-231Â cell line with an IC
