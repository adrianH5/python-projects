The evaluation of radon concentration in meal cooking plates is crucial, as radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer.
For this purpose, 65 meal dish samples were collected in Erbil city.
The radon concentration, surface exhalation rate, mass exhalation rate, and effective radon content, as well as the annual effective dose and excess lifetime cancer risk, were measured using a RAD-7 detector.
The results demonstrate that the range of radon concentration, surface and mass exhalation rates, effective radon content, annual effective dose, and excess lifetime cancer risk in the studied samples are 14.2-80.1â€‰Bq/m
