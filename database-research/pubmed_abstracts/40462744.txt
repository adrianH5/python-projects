Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive genetic disorder primarily affecting boys, characterized by muscle degeneration due to mutations in the DMD gene encoding dystrophin, a crucial protein for muscle fiber integrity.
The disease leads to significant muscle weakness and eventually to loss of ambulation.
Adeno-associated viral (AAV)-microdystrophin (MD) gene therapy shows promise in preclinical and clinical settings.
However, muscle fibrosis, a consequence of chronic inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling, exacerbates disease progression and may hinder therapeutic efficacy.
Periostin, a matricellular protein involved in fibrosis, is upregulated in DMD rodent models and correlates with collagen deposition.
We previously developed an antisense oligonucleotide strategy to induce exon 17 skipping and so reduce periostin expression and collagen accumulation in the fibrotic D2.
