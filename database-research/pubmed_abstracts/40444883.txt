Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a debilitating complication with few effective treatments.
Microglial activation contributes to the progression of CIBP.
2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, could inhibit microglial activation.
Its effect on CIBP remains unclear.
This study aims to investigate the role of 2-DG in CIBP mice and underlying mechanisms.
