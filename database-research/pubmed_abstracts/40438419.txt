Inflammation and nutritional status are involved in the occurrence and progression of cancer.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of nutritional status indices (geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), neutrophil to albumin ratio (NAR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI)), and comprehensive inflammatory indices (pan-immune inflammation value (PIV), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), and system inflammation response index (SIRI)) and bone metastasis of prostate cancer.
