In patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), lymphatic drainage may be altered due to factors such as prior axillary surgery and radiotherapy, thereby increasing the likelihood of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in atypical locations.
This study aimed to evaluate patients who underwent surgery for IBTR with lymphoscintigraphy for repeat SLN biopsy (re-SLNB), and to investigate the role of lymphoscintigraphy in re-SLNB in this patient group.
