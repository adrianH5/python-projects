Among various blood flow control techniques, the intermittent Pringle's maneuver (IPM) remains the most convenient and widely used method for reducing bleeding during hepatic resection (HR).
However, the impact of IPM on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence is still unclear.
To date, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly evaluated the impact of IPM on the tumor recurrence in HCC patients undergoing HR.
Since 2019, our team has been investigating the effects of 25-min IPM on liver function and post-hepatectomy safety in HCC patients.
To date, we have published two RCTs that confirm the safety and feasibility of 25-min IPM for HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function.
However, these studies focused exclusively on short-term outcomes and did not assess tumor recurrence.
Therefore, we are designing this RCT to compare the effects of 15-min IPM with 25-min IPM on early tumor recurrence in HCC patients undergoing HR.
