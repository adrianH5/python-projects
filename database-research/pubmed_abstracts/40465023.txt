Carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) detoxifies high-dose methotrexate in cancer or autoimmune therapies.
Additionally, CPG2 activates prodrugs at the tumor site in engineered CAR-T cell therapy.
Since CPG2 cleaves glutamate from the substrate, it also has potential applications in enhancing food flavors and developing biosensors.
However, cytoplasmic expression of recombinant CPG2 often leads to inclusion body formation, necessitating secretory production to improve product quality and streamline downstream industrial processes.
This study aimed to perform a comprehensive in silico analysis to identify an optimal signal peptide for CPG2 secretion.
The pelB leader sequence was selected for excretory production using the pET22b vector in Escherichia coli.
The enzyme was successfully secreted into both the periplasmic space of bacterial cells and the culture medium with activities of about 0.038 UmL
