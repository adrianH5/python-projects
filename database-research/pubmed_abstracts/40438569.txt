In patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) differentiating between benign acute peripheral vestibular disorders and possible life-threatening central, causes such as stroke, can be challenging due to similar symptoms.
AVS patients experience dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, nausea, vomiting, and abnormal eye movements.
This research evaluates the feasibility of using the eye-tracking capability of a mixed reality optical-see-through head-mounted display (MR-OST-HMD) to detect pathological eye movement patterns in patients with AVS.
