The development of targeted drug delivery systems has become a cornerstone of modern cancer therapy which provides a pathway to maximize treatment effectiveness while reducing side effects.
Among the plethora of innovative strategies, biotinylated nanoparticles have evolved as a hopeful tool due to their ability to exploit the elevated expression of biotin receptors on cancerous cells.
The design, synthesis, and functionalization of biotinylated nanoparticles for cancer treatment are thoroughly examined in this review article.
By leveraging biotin's high affinity for biotin receptors, these nanoparticles achieve selective cancerous cell targeting, leading to enhanced drug bioavailability and cellular uptake.
The discussion extends to the underlying mechanisms of drug release, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and strategies for achieving endosomal escape or pH-sensitive drug activation.
Furthermore, the article also emphasizes how biotinylation in combination therapy allows for synergistic effects with immunomodulators, nucleic acids, and chemotherapeutic drugs.
Preclinical studies are examined to underscore the translational potential of these systems.
The review concludes by addressing current challenges, including scalability, and potential immunogenicity, while proposing future directions for optimizing biotinylated nanoparticles as a transformative approach in cancer treatment.
