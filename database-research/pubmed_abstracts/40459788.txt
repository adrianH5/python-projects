Matrix remodeling-associated 7 (MXRA7) plays a key role in physiological and pathological processes involving the extracellular matrix (ECM) and tissue remodeling.
Recent studies have highlighted its functions in tissue injury, immune response, and cellular differentiation, yet no bibliometric studies have systematically mapped MXRA7 research.
This study evaluates global MXRA7 research from 2015 to 2024 to identify current trends and future directions.
