Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third in global incidence and second in mortality, with rates increasing among younger populations.
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is crucial for gastrointestinal function, and its dysfunction is associated with the progression of CRC.
Neurodegeneration may disrupt ENS function and facilitate tumor growth although the mechanisms remain unclear.
