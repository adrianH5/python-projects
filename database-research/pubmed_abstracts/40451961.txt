The Collaborative Group of the Americas on Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer (CGA-IGC) is an organization of healthcare providers, researchers, and advocates whose mission is to be a leading global authority in advancing the science and clinical management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes.
In 2024, the Executive Council developed a Strategic Plan, outlined here, to guide the organization's work over the next 3Â years.
The Strategic Plan is based on the four pillars of Education, Discovery & Innovation, Community & Collaboration, and Organizational Vitality, with associated goals, action plans, and metrics for each pillar.
Ultimately, the Strategic Plan will help CGA-IGC fulfill its vision and mission to advance the science and clinical management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancers.
