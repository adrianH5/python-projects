Recurrent hiatal hernia (HH) is a significant challenge in surgical practice, with recurrence rates reported to range between 25% and 42%.
This condition often requires redo surgeries, which are technically demanding and complex.
While advancements in surgical techniques have improved outcomes, the optimal strategy for the surgical management of HH recurrence remains unclear.
While mesh reinforcement is proposed to reduce recurrence, its use remains controversial due to potential complications.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate whether redo-surgery for HH with cruroplasty using mesh reinforcement was superior to suture cruroplasty in terms of postoperative complications and mortality.
To our knowledge, there is no existing review on the topic using a systematic approach.
