Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, posing significant therapeutic challenges due to the lack of effective targets.
Elevating intracellular calcium levels is a promising strategy in cancer therapy, and highly expressed calreticulin (CALR) in tumors has emerged as a potential target for inducing calcium overload.
However, few studies on CALR ligands have been reported.
Herein, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated pyrazolopyridine derivatives as potential CALR ligands.
Among them, the leading compound
