The increasing prevalence of mpox calls for the development of safer and more accessible next-generation vaccines.
Based on a structure-guided "two-in-one" immunogen design strategy, we have previously developed an innovative protein-based monkeypox virus (MPXV) vaccine, DAM, which addresses the issues of imbalanced bioavailability associated with cocktail vaccines and elicits superior antiviral immunity with a safety profile.
In this study, we iteratively designed two "four-in-one" chimeric immunogens, DAM
