Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide.
Atherosclerosis or plaque buildup in the arterial walls is the most common cause of CVD.
For atherosclerosis, statins and PCSK9 inhibitors are prescribed to patients to lower circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
However, lowering LDL does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, for all patients.
Targeting phenotypic switching of plaque-resident cells offers an alternative therapeutic strategy.
To that end, we previously showed mircroRNA-145 (miR-145) incorporated into monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) peptide amphiphile micelles bind CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) that is upregulated in synthetic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and activated endothelial cells (ECs) during atherosclerosis.
Previously, miR-145 micelles delivered in murine ApoE
