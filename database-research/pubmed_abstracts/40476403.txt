ADVANCES AND INTEGRATION OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE.
Nuclear medicine, a rapidly expanding field, plays a significant role in current technological and therapeutic advancements, particularly in oncology.
Using radioactive substances for imaging and treatment, this specialty focuses on the use of radiopharmaceuticals that precisely target pathophysiological processes at the molecular level.
This approach offers a functional rather than anatomical perspective of organs.
Recent innovations include the development of new radiotracers, technical improvements in imaging cameras, and the expansion of radiopeptides ligand therapies applications to new diseases.
The adoption of artificial intelligence in nuclear medicine is also revolutionizing the practice, making patient care less invasive while significantly increasing the speed and accuracy of diagnostics.
