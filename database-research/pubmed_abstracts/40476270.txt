In recent years, the integration of advanced technologies in surgery has transformed health care, with urology consistently pioneering these innovations.
Unlike the structured drug development process, surgical advancements follow a distinct pathway, exemplified by the Innovation, Development, Exploration, Assessment, and Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) framework, which supports safe, evidence-based innovation.
Complementary technologies, including three-dimensional (3D) models and augmented reality (AR), have emerged as transformative tools in robotic urological surgery, particularly for complex cases.
These technologies enhance surgical planning, intraoperative navigation, and postoperative outcomes, especially in kidney and prostate cancer surgeries.
Despite growing adoption, structured training programs tailored to 3D and AR applications remain underdeveloped.
To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of participants from the 12th Techno Urology Meeting (2024) to evaluate the current use and training needs for these technologies.
Among 126 respondents, the majority utilized 3D models (64.5%) and AR (40.3%) in clinical practice, highlighting their role in robotic partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy.
Respondents overwhelmingly emphasized the need for dedicated multidisciplinary courses with hands-on training and proficiency-based progression methodologies.
This study underscores the necessity of structured, technology-specific training to maximize the potential of 3D models and AR in robotic urology, offering critical insights for advancing surgical education and improving patient care outcomes.
