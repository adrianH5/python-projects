The polycomb group protein B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus Insertion region-1 (BMI1), a transcriptional repressor, has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression.
This study investigated the role of BMI1 in the regulation of angiogenesis and its association with angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) in CRC.
