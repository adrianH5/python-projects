This 29-color flow cytometry panel was developed and optimized for in-depth characterization of human peripheral blood NK cells for preclinical development and monitoring of NK cell therapies.
The panel includes markers associated with NK cell differentiation, cytotoxicity, tissue residency, as well as NK cell dysfunction.
Panel optimization was performed on freshly isolated and exÂ vivo activated NK cells enriched from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
Overall, this panel functions as a tool to extensively characterize human NK cells, paving the way for rapid and standardized approaches to evaluate the biological activity of therapeutic NK cell products.
