Head and neck cancer (HNC) represents a significant global health challenge, with over 660,000 annual diagnoses and a mortality rate exceeding 49â€¯%, making it the seventh most common cancer worldwide.
Current standard treatments, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, often result in significant side effects, underscoring the need for innovative and personalized therapeutic approaches.
In recent years, botulinum toxin (BoNT) has emerged as a transformative adjunctive therapy in HNC management.
Initially recognized for its neuromuscular blocking properties, BoNT has expanded its applications to alleviate complications such as sialorrhea, gustatory sweating, and neuropathic pain associated with HNC treatment.
Beyond symptomatic relief, emerging evidence suggests that BoNT may influence tumor biology by modulating the tumor microenvironment, disrupting nerve-cancer interactions, and altering key molecular pathways to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.
This article explores BoNT's achievements and therapeutic potential in treating HNC, examining its molecular mechanisms, clinical efficacy, and implications for future research.
By elucidating BoNT's role in symptom management and its potential as an anti-tumor agent, this review highlights a promising avenue for advancing personalized medicine and improving outcomes for HNC patients.
