The volume and complexity of biological data have significantly increased in recent years, often represented as network models continue to increase at a rapid pace.
However, drug discovery in the context of complex phenotypes are hampered by the difficulties inherent in producing machine learning algorithms that can integrate molecular-genetic, biochemical, physiological, and other diverse datasets.
Recent developments have expanded network analysis techniques, such as network embedding, to effectively explore multilayer network structures.
Multilayer networks, which incorporate various nodes and connections in formats such as multiplex, heterogeneous, and bipartite networks, provide an effective framework for merging diverse and multi-scale biological data sources.
However, current network embedding methods face challenges and limitations in addressing the heterogeneity and diversity of these networks.
Therefore, there is an essential need for the development of new network embedding methods to manage the complexity and diversity of multi-omics biological information effectively.
