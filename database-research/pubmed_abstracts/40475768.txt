Laryngeal cancer (LCA) is the second most common type of head and neck malignancy, characterized by high recurrence rates and poor overall survival (OS).
However, progress in curing LCA through molecular-targeted diagnostics and therapies is slow and limited.
The occurrence and progression of cancer are closely associated with metabolic reprogramming.
Therefore, this study aimed to identify metabolism-related LCA subtypes through a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic, mutational, methylation, and single-cell RNA sequencing, in hopes of finding factors which influences the prognosis of LCA.
