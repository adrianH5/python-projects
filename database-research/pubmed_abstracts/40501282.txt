Young adults (YAs) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) often face significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality.
Advance care planning (ACP) discussions can provide YAs with the opportunity to address treatment goals and care preferences with their family members and healthcare team.
However, such discussions often do not occur until YAs are critically ill or at the end of life.
This pilot study aimed to examine the usefulness of a series of planned ACP discussions during transplantation and their impact on dyadic (patient-caregiver) relationships.
