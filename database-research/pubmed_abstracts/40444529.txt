The National Cancer Database (NCDB) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database are widely used in colon cancer research, particularly for analyzing overall survival (OS) rates.
However, differences in demographics, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes across colon cancer stages and locations between these databases remain incompletely understood.
Addressing these disparities is crucial for researchers when selecting the most appropriate registry for survival analysis.
