Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is widely used to combat cancers through an apoptosis pathway.
However, drug resistance induced by upregulated glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells and systemic side effects significantly compromise its therapeutic efficacy.
The application of nanocarriers with a GSH-scavenging ability is a promising strategy to overcome these obstacles.
In addition, ferroptosis has shown great potential in eliminating the limitation of apoptosis-mediated chemotherapeutics.
Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform (S4MON-Cis@TA-Fe
