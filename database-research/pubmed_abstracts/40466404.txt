A positive surgical margin (PSM) is identified in about 10Â % of patients with thyroid cancer.
Macroscopic PSM indicates overt residual cancer, which can cause remnant tumor regrowth or metastasis, leading to worse outcomes.
However, most patients with PSM have only microscopic margin involvement, whose prognostic implications remain unclear.
This study investigated the impact of microscopic PSM on recurrence in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
