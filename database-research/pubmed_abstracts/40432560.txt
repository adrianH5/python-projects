Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which makes up the majority of malignant lymphomas of the head and neck region.
Lymphoma of the salivary gland is extremely rare.
Most patients present with a unilateral, hard, non-tender mass that gradually enlarges over time.
A thorough evaluation is necessary for a precise diagnosis because its clinical presentations are nonspecific, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis, leading to an inappropriate treatment plan, and ultimately delaying the optimal treatment of the disease.
Imaging techniques like computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imagings are part of the initial workup.
Prior to biopsy, it can be challenging to differentiate NHL of the parotid gland from other tumors.
Histological analysis and subsequent immunohistochemistry are essential for the definitive diagnosis.
Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, while surgery and radiation may be necessary in some circumstances.
Herein, we describe a 60-year-old man who had a steadily growing mass in his right parotid region.
The pathology results confirmed it to be NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtype.
No similar lesions were found on clinical examination and subsequent radiological imaging.
The patient received R-CHOP chemotherapy with impressive treatment outcomes.
To date, at least 12 months of regular follow-up have passed since the patient completed oncological care; he remains free from signs and symptoms of the disease.
This case points out the importance of considering lymphoma in the differential diagnoses when examining parotid neoplasms.
