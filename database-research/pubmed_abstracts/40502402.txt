Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a condition recognized to include distinct biochemical phenotypes: hypercalcemic, normocalcemic, and normohormonal PHPT.
This condition is characterized by inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels relative to serum calcium levels, leading to high bone turnover and decreased bone mineral density (BMD).
Although BMD has been shown to improve following curative parathyroidectomy (PTX), there is limited data on the relationship between BMD changes after PTX and according to the clinical phenotypes of PHPT.
This prospective study aims to identify the best candidates for surgery among these three phenotypes of PHPT by examining symptoms and comorbidities, biochemical results, and both pre- and post-operative DXA scans.
