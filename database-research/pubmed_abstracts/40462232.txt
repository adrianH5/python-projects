Inflammation and genomic instability are among the hallmarks of human cancer.
Proinflammatory cytokines induce DNA damage through the accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), which often leads to base alternations.
The link between proinflammatory cytokines and chromosomal instability remains largely elusive.
