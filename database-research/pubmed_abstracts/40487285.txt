Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide.
The link between inflammation and CRC is well established.
Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) upon diagnosis is a known negative prognostic factor for CRC patients.
Monomeric CRP (mCRP) has been demonstrated in tissues of several diseases associated with inflammation, including colon cancer (CC).
mCRP possesses proinflammatory properties and is a possible mediator of tumor-promoting inflammation.
This study aimed to detect and quantify circulating mCRP and assess potential correlations with clinical CRP and intra-tumoral mCRP in CC patients.
