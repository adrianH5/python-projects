Consolidative chest radiotherapy (XRT) after chemoimmunotherapy may provide benefits in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) due to the condition's high sensitivity to radiation.
Current guidelines suggest chest XRT for patients with ES-SCLC who respond to chemotherapy, given its association with improved 2-year overall survival (OS), and reduced progression and recurrence rates.
However, its role in the era of chemo-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC remains unclear.
