Sporadic optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are uncommon and have greater predisposition to severe clinical presentations and complications.
Severe visual impairment is the most frequent presentation.
The treatment is based on multiple factors and needs to be individualized.
Precise assessment of visual function is one of the important factors to plan the management.
We present a case of sporadic OPG in a 7-year-old female with severe visual decline.
Visual functions were assessed ophthalmologically and electrophysiologically.
Diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of clinical, radiological, histopathological and electrophysiologic findings.
Surgical resection was planned owing to the poor visual functions and the mass effects.
Patient is on regular follow-ups with no signs of deterioration so far.
Appropriate visual assessment is crucial in young children with sporadic optic pathway glioma for planning the mode of treatment.
Surgical resection in cases with severe visual impairment is helpful, however, irreversible visual impairment remains irremediable.
