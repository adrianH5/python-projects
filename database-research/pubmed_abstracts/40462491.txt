Antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevents and treats, but does not eradicate, HIV.
Early ART initiation is associated with post-ART virologic control, particularly among African women, and anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) may modulate immune responses to HIV.
We evaluate whether early ART with or without anti-HIV-1 bnAb VRC01, present at HIV acquisition, is associated with later ART-free control in African women and we assess potential associations with observed control.
