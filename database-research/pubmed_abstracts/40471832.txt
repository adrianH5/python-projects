Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a serious condition linked to multiple health issues such as nervous system damage, heart disease, alcoholic liver disease, development of cancers, fetal alcohol syndrome, mental health disorders, and injuries to self and others.
AUD presents a growing problem worldwide with significant economic and health care costs.
Despite its growing prevalence, AUD remains underdiagnosed, partly due to the underreporting of alcohol intake and the stigma associated with the diagnosis.
While traditionally diagnosed through clinical evaluation and patient history, diagnosis of AUD-related disorders and diseases can be significantly aided by advanced imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and US, allowing detection at an earlier stage.
Early detection through imaging may allow timely intervention and treatment, potentially preventing further damage to organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas, mitigating the risk of serious complications and improving overall health outcomes.
Radiologists play a key role by recognizing the imaging signatures of AUD, enabling them to flag potential issues early on.
The authors highlight how imaging aids in diagnosing AUD-related conditions, including alcohol-related central nervous system disorders, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, alcoholic liver disease at various stages from hepatic steatosis to cirrhosis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal manifestations, fetal alcohol syndrome leading to birth defects, musculoskeletal manifestations, and increased risk of certain cancers.
By understanding these imaging signatures, radiologists can contribute to accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
