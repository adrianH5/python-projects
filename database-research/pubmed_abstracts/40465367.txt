Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer for male health with ultrahigh recurrence rates to cause high mortality.
However, clinical imaging and biopsy techniques suffer the bulky testing equipment and high cost, and blood assay requires blood pretreatment before analysis to significantly restrict home-in self-examination and postoperative follow-up of PCa.
Herein, a blood-drop 4-min-test technique is designed to precisely screen PCa by a high-ordered coaxial-nanocables-based aptasensor.
The electrospinning potential is employed as the driving force to regulate the distribution of mixed reduced graphene oxide and polyacrylonitrile from disorder to highly order to large-scale weave coaxial nanocables-based films.
This architecture has contributed abundant active DNA bonding sites and served as 3D network electron transmission channels to dramatically amplify detection signals with short response time.
Moreover, a target-induced chain release strategy is implemented to precisely capture the PCa biomarker.
Furthermore, a household PCa analyzer is developed to achieve ultrafast, precise, and nonhospital assays of clinical patients within 4Â min which is 30 times faster than the state-of-the-art commercial instruments.
This high-performance analyzer has great potential for early screening and prognostic evaluation of PCa to benefit real-time tests for both in-hospital and nonhospital patients.
