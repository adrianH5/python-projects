Biosynthesis of nanoparticles offers eco-friendly and biocompatible solutions for biomedical and environmental applications.
This study aimed to biosynthesis of yttrium oxide nanoparticles (Y₂O₃NPs) from star anise biomolecules, further functionalized with fucoidan (Fu) and folic acid (Fa) to produce FuFa/Y₂O₃NPs.
Analytical characterization techniques such as FE-SEM, FT-IR used to identify functional groups, the DLS analysis revealed that Y₂O₃NPs particles size 82 ± 0.4 nm and functionalizing increased size of FuFa/Y₂O₃NPs have a diameter of 91 ± 0.9 nm, indicating effective Fu-Fa coating on the surface nanoparticles.
Meanwhile, the zeta potential (ζ) of Y₂O₃NPs was -20.4 mV, while FuFa/Y₂O₃NPs was +27.2 mV.
HR-TEM examination of FuFa/Y₂O₃NPs confirms morphological changes, including growing size and layer development.
The Y₂O₃NPs have a crystalline structure, whereas FuFa/Y₂O₃NPs have an amorphous structure as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
Cytotoxicity was evaluated against cancer cell lines such as A549 lung cancer and HeLa cervical cancer.
The FuFa/Y₂O₃NPs showed enhanced anticancer activity with IC
