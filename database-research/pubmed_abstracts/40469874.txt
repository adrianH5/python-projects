In the management of advanced ovarian cancer, complex surgery is often necessary to achieve the goal of complete gross resection.
Diaphragm resections and intrathoracic procedures are safe and feasible in select patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
In our institution, up to 68% of cytoreductive surgery requires diaphragm peritonectomy, and 11% involve intrathoracic cytoreduction (Kahn et al., 2023, Kahn et al., 2024).
The left diaphragm is often involved, requiring a peritonectomy.
The most common complications include pleural effusion and pneumothorax, although a rare complication of left-sided diaphragmatic herniation has been reported (Ehmann et al., 2021a, Ehmann et al., 2021b).
