DXd, a camptothecin derivative, is employed as the payload molecule for the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which is in current clinical use for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer.
Despite the clinical success of ADCs for treatment of cancer, exposure to released payload in plasma and extracellular fluids contributes to off-target toxicities, which limit ADC dosage and efficacy.
In this study, we evaluated an anti-DXd antibody fragment, 8C2 Fab, for utility in mitigating DXd toxicity in cell culture and for improving the therapeutic index of T-DXd in vivo in mice.
8C2 Fab was produced, purified, and characterized for binding to DXd and T-DXd.
In vitro competitive cytotoxicity assays showed that 8C2 Fab blocked the cell-killing effect of DXd, increasing the DXd concentration associated with 50% growth inhibition (IC
