Treatment for distant metastases (DM) of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) aims to improve the prognosis and quality of life (QOL).
Radioactive iodine and molecular targeted therapies are the primary systemic treatments for DM.
Combining these with local treatments, such as surgery and radiotherapy targeting metastatic sites, may provide additional benefits to systemic therapy.
