Postoperative malnutrition is very common in laryngeal cancer patients, which will lead to slower healing, lower quality of life, and increase patients' pain and medical cost.
Enteral nutrition can better improve malnutrition in laryngeal cancer patients.
The aim of this study was to provide an evidence-based basis for perioperative clinical practice in laryngeal cancer patients by systematically searching for interventions for perioperative enteral nutrition management.
