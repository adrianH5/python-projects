Early pancreatic cancer is often challenging to diagnose, and by the time it is definitively diagnosed, metastasis may have already occurred.
The liver is the most common site for pancreatic cancer metastasis, while metastases to other sites are considered rare.
This paper explores various rare metastatic sites of pancreatic cancer, analyzing the current status, treatment options, and prognosis for different metastatic locations, and provides a detailed explanation of the mechanisms underlying the relatively favorable prognosis of lung metastases.
While patients with distant metastasis of pancreatic cancer are generally not considered candidates for surgical treatment, in cases of oligometastatic disease, a comprehensive treatment strategy centered on surgery can effectively improve patient prognosis.
Given the complexity of the condition and the variability in prognosis among patients with rare metastases of pancreatic cancer, it is crucial to develop personalized treatment schemes to achieve the goal of precision treatment.
