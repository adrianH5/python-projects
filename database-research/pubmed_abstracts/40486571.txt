Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed malignancy (after lung cancer) in men worldwide.
The most common site for metastasis of prostate cancer is bone (84%), followed by distant lymph nodes (10.6%), liver (10.2%), and lung being the least with 9.1%.
Isolated lung metastasis is very rare and is present in less than 4.6% of metastatic prostate cancer.
This is the first case of de novo isolated lung metastasis of prostate cancer in our setting.
