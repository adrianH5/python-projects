Hormone receptor (HR)-low human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancers (BC) have similar outcomes to triple-negative BC; however, there is a lack of consensus on treatment recommendations for this subset.
We present results from a US National Cancer Database (NCDB) analysis of patients with stage I-III HER2-negative BC categorized into groups by estrogen and progesterone receptor (PR) expression: HR-Neg, HR-Low, HR-Intermediate (HR-Int), and HR-High.
