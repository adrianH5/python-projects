Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody used in patients with anti-NMDAR antibody (Ab)-mediated encephalitis as both an acute escalation therapy and a longer term relapse risk-reduction treatment.
The potential long-term benefit of a single course administered during the acute disease phase on future relapse risk is uncertain.
Moreover, the optimal dosing duration to reduce relapse risk is unknown.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single course of rituximab on relapse incidence.
We also studied the duration of effect of a course of rituximab in adult patients with anti-NMDAR Ab-mediated encephalitis.
