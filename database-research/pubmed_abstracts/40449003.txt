MicroRNAs (miRNAs) significantly contribute to melanoma plasticity, a key factor in metastasis and therapy resistance.
Here, we provide a protocol for analysis of miRNAs in human melanoma cells.
We describe two approaches for plating cells, either using cell chambers or attaching cells to microscopy slides by means of centrifugation.
We first focus on cell pretreatment and staining procedures using the RNAscope Plus small RNA-RNA high-definition (RNAscope Plus smRNA-RNA HD) assay.
We then detail the quantitative analysis of miRNA expression and co-localization.
