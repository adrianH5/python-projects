Cancer is a complex disease marked by changes in the levels and functions of key cellular proteins, including oncogenes and tumor suppressors.
Proteomics technology enables the identification of crucial protein targets and signaling pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.
Various proteomics techniques have been employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cancer, aiding in the confirmation and characterization of heritable disorders.
