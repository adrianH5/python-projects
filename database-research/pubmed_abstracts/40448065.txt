Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 24 (USP24), a deubiquitinating enzyme, regulates protein stability by removing ubiquitin.
This study investigates the role of UPS24 in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis.
It also explores the effect of targeting USP24 on metabolic disorders, focusing on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and liver diseases.
