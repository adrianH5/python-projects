Rosacea is a common inflammatory disease.
Four clinical rosacea subtypes have been described, with the papulo-pustular being the most common.
At present, the only FDA-approved treatment for papulo-pustular rosacea is low-dose doxycycline.
Retinoids, in particular isotretinoin, have shown for decades positive outcomes in the treatment of rosacea, but due to the lack of robust evidence, they are still considered an off-label treatment for this condition.
