Cost-effective diagnosis and staging of lung cancer requires careful consideration of the clinical-radiographic stage based on PET-CT and consideration of the patient's overall health status, treatment options, and patient preferences/values.
CT guided biopsy or convex endobronchial ultrasound (cEBUS) with rapid onsite pathologic evaluation (ROSE) and peripheral bronchoscopic biopsy is best for patients with peripheral tumors.
In patients with centrally located tumors or with larger tumors, cEBUS with ROSE and peripheral biopsy is best and cost-effective.
Advances in bronchoscopy that improve sensitivity for malignancy in patients with stage I/II lung cancer are likely to provide significant net monetary benefit.
