This study aims to compare the survival benefits of perioperative versus neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)-based therapy in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), focusing specifically on those who achieve major pathological response (MPR) or pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant ICI-based treatment.
