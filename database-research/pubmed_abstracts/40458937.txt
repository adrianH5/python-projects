As a result of adjuvant therapies for pancreatic cancer including new techniques, such as arterial divestment, and, for instance, as a result of more main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms being diagnosed, the number of total pancreatectomies is increasing.

The aim of this study was to analyse mortality after total pancreatectomy using real-world data.
