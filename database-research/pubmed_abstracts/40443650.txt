The m7G methyltransferase METTL1 has been implicated in the occurrence and progression of several cancers.
However, its clinical significance in cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) remains poorly understood.
To address this gap, we conducted comprehensive data mining using publicly available datasets and two single-cell datasets.
Additionally, we employed CCK8 assays, clone formation assays, and cell migration and invasion experiments to validate our findings from the data mining.
Our results revealed that METTL1 is significantly upregulated in SKCM and is associated with a stem cell-like phenotype.
Patients with high METTL1 expression exhibited worse prognosis.
Furthermore, we identified that the high expression of METTL1 in SKCM is driven by copy number amplification and regulated by the transcription factor MYC.
