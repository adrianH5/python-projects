Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers affecting women worldwide.
Early detection and treatment are crucial in significantly reducing mortality rates Microcalcifications (MCs) are of particular importance among the various breast lesions.
These tiny calcium deposits within breast tissue are present in approximately 30% of malignant tumors and can serve as critical indirect indicators of early-stage breast cancer.
Three or more MCs within an area of 1 cmÂ² are considered a Microcalcification Cluster (MCC) and assigned a BI-RADS category 4, indicating a suspicion of malignancy.
Mammography is the most used technique for breast cancer detection.
Approximately one in two mammograms showing MCCs is confirmed as cancerous through biopsy.
MCCs are challenging to detect, even for experienced radiologists, underscoring the need for computer-aided detection tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
CNNs require large amounts of domain-specific data with consistent resolutions for effective training.
However, most publicly available mammogram datasets either lack resolution information or are compiled from heterogeneous sources.
Additionally, MCCs are often either unlabeled or sparsely represented in these datasets, limiting their utility for training CNNs.
In this dataset, we present the MEXBreast, an annotated MCCs Mexican digital mammogram database, containing images from resolutions of 50, 70, and 100 microns.
MEXBreast aims to support the training, validation, and testing of deep learning CNNs.
