Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibits a high global morbidity rate and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.
In response to the urgent need for effective HCC treatments, naturally occurring, botanical-driven compounds have gained increasing attention.
Notably, the anti-tumor properties of some compounds might be linked to the induction of ferroptosis.
The present study aimed to evaluate the capacity of Monotropein (Mon) to induce ferroptosis in HCC and elucidate its underlying mechanisms.
First, Mon was found to play an anti-tumor role in HCC cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and invasion, elevated the expression of E-cadherin, and decreased N-cadherin and Vimentin expression.
Furthermore, Mon activated ferroptosis in HCC cells, characterized by elevated levels of Fe
