T and NK cell lymphoma with abnormal CD20 expression is a condition that primarily seen in Asians.
Due to the variable expression of CD20, it is difficult to generalize its origin, leading to controversial conclusions about the role of CD20.
In this review, we provide an overview of CD20 localization and function in three cell types.
In NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL), CD20 was discovered to be confined to B cells, presenting a mature active phenotype and having an inert course.
However, in T-cell lymphoma (TCL), variable expression of CD20 antigen on T cells and NK cells correlates with tumor transformation and rituximab efficacy.
We highlight the fact that CD20 expression is stage-specific and further classify CD20 antigen assignment, which contributes to understanding the variety of outcome and the function of CD20 during various phases of tumor development.
