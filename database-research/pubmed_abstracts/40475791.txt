The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends annual lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for asymptomatic 50- to 80-year-old adults with a 20-pack year history who currently smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years.
Foreign-born Chinese livery drivers are a group at disproportionately high risk for lung cancer due to high smoking prevalence and occupational exposure to airborne contaminants and carcinogens.
This paper describes a pilot randomized controlled trial to educate and navigate high-risk, previously unscreened Chinese livery drivers to lung cancer screening, and describes barriers to recruitment and retention.
