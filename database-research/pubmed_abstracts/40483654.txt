As possible delivery systems for anticancer medications and molecular imaging, polymer nanoparticles have tremendous potentials.
This study aimed to develop a novel drug delivery system using PTX conjugated β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex-capped gold nanoparticles (PTX-β-CD-AuNPs) to manage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
Characterization techniques confirmed the successful synthesis of PTX-β-CD-AuNPs with mean size of around 43 nm.
In vitro studies demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity of PTX-β-CD-AuNPs compared to the individual components, as evidenced by MTT assay results.
Furthermore, morphological analysis revealed significant alterations in cancer cell morphology, including cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis induction.
The clonogenic assay demonstrated the ability of PTX-β-CD-AuNPs to suppress colony formation, indicating potential targeting of cancer stem cells.
Additionally, migration assays showed reduced cell migratory capacity, suggesting potential anti-metastatic effects.
These findings illustrate the efficacy of PTX-β-CD-AuNPs as a promising nanocarrier for treating TNBC.
To assess the therapeutic efficacy of PTX-β-CD-AuNPs and clarify the mechanisms behind it, additional study is essential.
