To investigate the expression of KRT80 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its relationship with clinicopathological factors, prognosis, as well as the differences in KRT80 expression between Xuanwei area and Non-xuanwei area, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma.
Based on 178 clinical cases, immunohistochemical methods combined with public databases were used to examine the expression of KRT80 in NSCLC patients and analyze its correlation with various clinicopathological factors and prognosis.
The study confirmed the up-regulation of KRT80 expression in NSCLC cancer tissues.
Significant regional specific and histological subtype differences in KRT80 expression were revealed.
Although the expression level of KRT80 has no direct significant correlation with the prognosis of NSCLC patients, it has a good ability to distinguish cancerous tissue from paracancer tissue.
KRT80 can be used as a diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC patients, but its specific mechanism and clinical application value still need to be further explored.
