Circadian organization is involved in many gastrointestinal tract (GIT) functions such as the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity.
There is compelling evidence that perturbation of the circadian clock decreases intestinal epithelial cells' resiliency to alcohol-induced injury.
One of the most common causes of circadian misalignment is wrong-time eating (largest meal at dinner) in modern societies.
Yet, few studies have examined the importance of peripheral circadian rhythms of the GIT to alcohol consumption.
Eating patterns during physiologic rest time, defined as wrong-time eating (WTE), misalign the peripheral circadian clock of the GIT and the body's central clock.
This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that: (1) WTE worsens alcohol-induced disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and (2) decreased intestinal barrier resiliency to alcohol effects by WTE-disrupted circadian is, at least in part, due to microbiota dysbiosis.
Alcohol (20% v/v) and a restricted timed-food paradigm were administered to PERIOD2 luciferase (PER2:LUC) reporter BL/6 mice for 10â€‰weeks.
Intestinal barrier integrity, intestinal (stool) microbiota, and microbial metabolites (cecal-derived) were examined.
Peripheral circadian misalignment exacerbated alcohol-induced disruption of intestinal barrier integrity (tight junctional proteins) leading to increased intestinal permeability (
