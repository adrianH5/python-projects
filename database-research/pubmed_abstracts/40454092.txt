Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly aggressive tumor associated with risk factors, such as chronic infection, gallstones, and exposure to harmful chemicals.
Our study explores the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and long noncoding RNA HEGBC in GBC progression.
We found that PAHs activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which enhances HEGBC expression and promotes GBC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis both
