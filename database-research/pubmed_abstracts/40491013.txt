Fully wearable devices are crucial for real-time health monitoring, but existing devices often lack stable power, on-site signal processing, and multimodal sensing.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first self-powered and fully wearable sensor (MESFW) based on multiplexed green biofuels.
The MESFW integrates a microfluidic module, sensing module, laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes, and customized electronics, enabling highly sensitive detection of glucose and alcohol in noninvasive biofluids (sweat, breath, saliva, tears) while monitoring daily activities (temperature, pressure, touch).
Experiments show the MESFW can track glucose and alcohol levels before and after meals/drinking, powered continuously for 24 h. With machine learning, it accurately identifies wearing types and enables real-time health prediction.
This innovation offers a novel approach to real-time physiological monitoring.
