Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis and necroptosis are regulated variants of cell death that can drive inflammation or even promote antigen-specific immune responses.
In oncological settings, indolent inflammatory reactions have been consistently associated with accelerated disease progression and resistance to treatment.
Conversely, adaptive immune responses specific for tumor-associated antigens are generally restraining tumor development and contribute to treatment sensitivity.
Here, we harnessed female C57BL/6J mice lacking key regulators of MPT-driven necrosis and necroptosis to investigate whether whole-body defects in these pathways would influence mammary carcinogenesis as driven by subcutaneous slow-release medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, M) pellets plus orally administered 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA, D), an in vivo model that recapitulates multiple facets of the biology and immunology of human hormone receptor positive (HR
