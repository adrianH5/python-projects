Short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) is a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial enzyme with a role in the degradation of fatty acids.
Because the protein also is a negative regulator of insulin secretion in pancreatic Î²-cells, inactivating mutations in the SCHAD gene (HADH) cause congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) and severe hypoglycemia.
Here we sought to identify novel interaction partners of SCHAD that might be particularly relevant for the endocrine pancreas.
