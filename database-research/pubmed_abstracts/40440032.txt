Heme is a vital but highly reactive compound that is synthesized in mitochondria and subsequently distributed to a variety of subcellular compartments for utilization.
The transport of heme is essential for normal cellular metabolism, growth, and development.
Despite the vital importance of heme transport within the cell, data are lacking about how newly synthesized heme is shuttled within the mitochondrion or exported from the organelle.
Here, we briefly summarize current knowledge about the process of mitochondrial heme distribution and discuss the current unresolved questions pertinent to this process.
