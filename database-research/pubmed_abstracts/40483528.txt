Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are critical drivers of metastasis and chemoresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) has been implicated in tumor progression, but its role in LCSC stemness and HCC malignancy remains unclear.
This study explores the effects of Pyk2 and its regulation by miR-23b-3p on LCSC function and HCC progression.
