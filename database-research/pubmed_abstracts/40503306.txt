Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has become a major challenge in clinical treatment due to its highly aggressive nature and limited therapeutic options.
A carbon nanoparticles-Fe(ii) complex (CNSI-Fe), as both a ferroptosis inducer and photothermal agent (PTA), could exert anticancer effects through the ferroptosis pathway and photothermal action.
Herein, we evaluated the photothermal therapeutic effects of CNSI-Fe in mice bearing the model tumor of TNBC (4T1 tumor).
The therapeutic effects of CNSI-Fe were compared without/with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation both
