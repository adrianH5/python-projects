Rhizopus spp.
is a major cause of mucormycosis, a severe infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality.
Treatment is challenging due to rising antifungal resistance.
Glycosylation is a crucial technique for enhancing the properties of phenolic compounds like eugenol.
The present study aims to examine the antifungal efficacy of eugenol glycoconjugates against azole and amphotericin B-resistant Rhizopus isolates.
