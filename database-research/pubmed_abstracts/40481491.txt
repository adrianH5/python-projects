Disease-specific patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are widely used to evaluate not only a patient's view of their symptoms, functional status, and health related quality of life, but also clinical benefit of treatments.
The Patient Perspective of Arrhythmia Questionnaire (PPAQ) was initially developed as a self-administered, disease-specific PROM for patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) assessing the impact of the arrhythmia and symptoms on patients' daily activities and physical, emotional, and social functioning.
Preliminary evidence of content and construct validity has been previously demonstrated, but only in SVT patients in the U.S. and Poland.
The aim of this study was to further evaluate the concurrent validity of the PPAQ in patients having a variety of arrhythmias and to explore whether differences in symptoms existed by gender.
