Salivary gland tumors make up a relatively small proportion, ranging from 1% to 4%, of all neoplasms in the human body.
Among these, pleomorphic adenoma stands out as a distinct benign tumor of the salivary glands, characterized by a combination of epithelial and mesenchymal elements.Only 0.3% to 1.5%, of biopsies in oral and Maxillofacial pathology laboratories are associated with tumors originating from minor salivary glands.
Keratinizing pleomorphic adenoma, a rare variant accounting for 5-10% of all pleomorphic adenomas, differs from the typical form due to the presence of keratin within the tumor cells, serving as a distinguishing histological feature.
The incidence of keratinizing pleomorphic adenoma is not well-established but is believed to be less than 1 case per 100,000 people per year.
Here we present an atypical histopathological variation of pleomorphic adenoma, featuring extensive keratinization and manifesting in a less typical anatomical location in a 57-year-old male patient.
