Osimertinib, a recommended front-line (1L) treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations [exon 19 deletion (ex19del)/exon 21 L858R substitution (L858R)], demonstrated significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) compared with other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the FLAURA trial.
However, most patients developed secondary resistance, and subpopulations experienced disparate outcomes.
This retrospective, observational study aimed to describe real-world treatment outcomes along with patient clinical characteristics associated with different clinical outcomes among patients with EGFR-mutated (ex19del/L858R) NSCLC who received osimertinib as 1L therapy.
