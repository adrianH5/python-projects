Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions have a favorable prognosis and are primarily treated with sublobar resection.
Current guidelines uniformly define sufficient margins as greater than 2Â cm or the size of the lesion, regardless of the lesion's characteristics.
This study evaluates the prognostic impact of insufficient margins in sublobar resection for pure GGO adenocarcinomas.
