The labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of sample preparation poses significant challenges for bioanalysis, especially for large-scale samples characterized by limited volumes/mass, and low analyte abundance.
Additionally, manual sample processing can compromise reproducibility.
To overcome these limitations, automation and high-throughput methodologies are essential, highlighting the need for an automated, high-throughput sample preparation and analysis workflow.
