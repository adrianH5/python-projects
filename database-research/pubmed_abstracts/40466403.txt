Chylothorax after oesophagectomy occurs in up to 8.9Â % of cases, resulting in significant morbidity, such as, malnutrition, respiratory distress, and immunosuppression.
Prophylactic thoracic duct obliteration through ligation (TDL) or resection (TDR) is proposed to reduce the incidence of chylothorax.
However, the impact of these procedures on chylothorax incidence and long-term survival outcomes remain unclear.
