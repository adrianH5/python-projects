Accurate diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma is essential for effective clinical management.
Immunohistochemistry plays a pivotal role in confirming or excluding a breast origin.
In this review, we discuss both traditional and newly identified breast cancer markers, with a particular focus on studies related to TRPS1, and share our experience in applying this marker.
Additionally, we explore the challenges associated with using these markers to differentiate metastatic breast cancer from malignancies of other origins.
