Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Despite advances in treatment, cancer relapse remains a significant challenge, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies.
In this study, we engineered nanobody-based chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cells targeting cadherin 17 (CDH17) for the treatment of GI tumors.
In addition, to enhance the efficacy of CAR-NK cells, we also incorporated CV1, a CD47-SIRP
