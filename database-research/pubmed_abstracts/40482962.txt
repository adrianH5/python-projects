Although cascade testing affords disease-free relatives the opportunity for genetically targeted primary disease prevention and is endorsed by multiple guidelines, utilization studies reveal that rates remain low.
Lack of family communication and high testing costs are two of the most commonly documented barriers to testing.
We leverage two well-known choice-architecture tools from psychology and behavioral science - default effect and zero price effect - to address these barriers and improve cascade testing rates in hereditary cancer.
By altering the underlying choice architecture, individual decision-making can be influenced with minimal effort to support behavioral changes.
