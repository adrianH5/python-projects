Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) catalyzes core fucosylation, a critical post-translational modification influencing cellular processes.
Aberrant core fucosylation is linked to tumor progression, including proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion.
This review integrates the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of FUT8, its interactions with key signaling molecules (E-cadherin, EGFR, TGF-β, β-catenin), and their impact on tumor behavior.
We evaluate FUT8's role in cancer immunity, focusing on antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and immune checkpoint regulation, alongside the development of FUT8 inhibitors for clinical use.
Additionally, we explore FUT8 and core fucosylation products as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
By analyzing molecular mechanisms, immune interactions, and clinical potential, we highlight FUT8's pivotal role in cancer biology, address its tissue-specific pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles, and propose future research to enhance cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.
