Peritoneal metastasis represents the most aggressive form of gastric cancer metastasis and serves as a primary contributor to poor prognosis.
Conventional therapeutic approaches offer limited survival benefits, making the development of novel treatment strategies an urgent medical priority.
With advancements in molecular medicine and sociomedical sciences, contemporary cancer management is evolving towards individualized precision medicine.
This transition has given rise to a plethora of innovative therapeutic strategies, including molecular typing-driven targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and locally targeted technology.
These strategies emphasize the construction of a precise and individualized therapeutic framework through the integration of genomics, imaging genomics, and artificial intelligence-assisted decision-making, which promotes the continuous improvement of treatment strategies for peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer.
This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the prevailing individualized treatment modalities from the standpoint of precision medicine, offering novel perspectives on the management of peritoneal metastasis in gastric cancer.
