Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL), a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is classified as an independent subtype of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification (Turner et al., 2010).
The 5th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO 2022) classification of hematolymphoid tumors retains this subtype (Alaggio et al., 2022).
IVLBCL, which is characterized by neoplastic lymphocyte proliferation within the lumen of small blood vessels, tends to invade organs, such as the nervous system, skin, bone marrow (BM), and lung (D'Angelo et al., 2019; Satoh et al., 2019; VÃ¡squez et al., 2019; Fukami et al., 2020).
