Copper (Cu) is an indispensable micronutrient that maintains signaling pathways and biological homeostasis in almost all cell types; however, its excess affects the tricarboxylic acid cycle, causes the accumulation of fatty acylated proteins, destabilization of iron-sulfur cluster proteins, and increases the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, leading to proteotoxic stress and cell death.
Cuproptosis, a form of Cu-dependent cell death, differs from other types of regulated cell death (RCD) and was first reported in
