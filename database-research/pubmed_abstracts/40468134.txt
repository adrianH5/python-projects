The survival differences between open esophagectomy (OE) and thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TE) for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) across different pathological tumor-node-metastasis stage (pStage) remain controversial.
Therefore, this study aims to compare long-term survival between OE and TE in patients with ESCC across different pStage groups using overlap weighting.
