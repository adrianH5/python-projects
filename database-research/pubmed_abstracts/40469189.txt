Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is an infrequent malignant tumor that has a high death rate and a poor prognosis.
The therapeutic methods for ATC include traditional surgery, chemoradiotherapy and targeted therapy.
However, the effect of ATC treatment is not ideal.
We report a patient with ATC who developed rapid local recurrence and multiple systemic metastases after radical thyroidectomy.
After multimodal radiotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy and immunotherapy, the patient's tumors shrunk significantly and achieved long-term control.
The therapeutic effect was remarkable.
These findings provide a viable new treatment choice for ATC patients in the future.
