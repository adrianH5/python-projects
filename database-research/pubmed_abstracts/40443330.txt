Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor, ranking fifth in incidence and mortality among all malignancies globally.
The lack of early symptoms or the non-specific nature of symptoms means that most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage.
The unique high heterogeneity of gastric cancer largely limits the effectiveness of traditional therapies, resulting in poor prognosis for patients.
In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new treatment option for advanced gastric cancer.
The immunotherapy era has driven gastric cancer treatment towards more personalized and precise directions.
There have been many new research advances in the fields of immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, and cancer vaccines.
However, there are also many challenges and difficulties.
It is hoped that this review will provide ideas and suggestions for the in-depth exploration of immunotherapy for gastric cancer.
