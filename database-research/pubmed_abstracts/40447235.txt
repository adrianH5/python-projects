Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer mortality in the long term but carries immediate risks.
Guidelines recommend screening persons whose life expectancy exceeds the screening test's time to benefit (TTB), defined as the time from screening initiation to first observed benefit.
This study aimed to estimate the TTB for lung cancer screening to prevent lung cancer mortality.
