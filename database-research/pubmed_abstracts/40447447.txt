Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial in the tightly regulated process of neurogenesis from radial glial cells (RGCs) to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) to neurons during embryonic brain development.
Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins as important epigenetic readers are implicated in development and diseases, yet their roles in embryonic neurogenesis remain largely unexplored.
In this study, we found different PHD finger proteins are differentially expressed along the neurogenesis trajectory.
Among them, we investigated the function of PHF23 using mouse models, which is highly expressed in RGCs and IPCs, but not in neurons.
Our findings demonstrate that PHF23 is essential for proper neurogenesis, and
