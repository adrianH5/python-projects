This study aims to assess the feasibility of implementing a hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) program at the Oncology Directorate of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana, addressing specific infrastructure limitations that hinder patient care and treatment efficiency.
Hence, we conducted a feasibility study to start a HFRT lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) program using currently available resources.
The goal is to alleviate the burden on patients and health care providers, particularly in the context of limited resources.
