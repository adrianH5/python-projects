The protective effect of HPV vaccination against cervical cancer has been demonstrated in registry linkage studies.
The start age of screening in those studies was lower than 25 years.
We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of bivalent HPV16/18 vaccination against invasive cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3+) in the Netherlands, where routine screening starts at age 30 years.
