INNOVATIONS IN SURGICAL ONCOLOGY PRACTICE.
Oncology surgery is evolving with the times.
It is used to treat the most common, and serious cancers, such as lung, gynecological, prostate, and colon.
One of the major advances is robotic surgery, which optimizes the minimally invasive approach to enable increasingly complex procedures to be carried out, while reducing blood loss, complications and post-operative pain, and speeding recovery and return home.
This technology also offers real-time endoscopic imaging, potentially coupled with fluorescence or three-dimensional modelling for improved intra-operative assessment.
Accelerated recovery after surgery aims to improve post-operative recovery and patient well-being, while reducing complications and hospital stays.
Finally, surgical simulation uses equipment, virtual reality or standardized patients to teach and rehearse diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, thus improving the training of healthcare professionals.
