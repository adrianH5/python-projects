Trihalomethanes (THMs) in drinking water are regulated for carcinogenic health risks.
However, frequent water quality monitoring imposes significant resource burdens.
This study proposes a framework integrating interpretable machine learning (ML) with virtual data augmentation to predict THM occurrence and associated cancer risks.
Based on 146 real samples, this study uniquely uses COD
