Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an important genetic material in eukaryotic cells.
Mitochondrial DNA maintenance-related gene (mtDNA MRG) variants contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer progression and are associated with cancer prognosis.
However, the mechanism of mtDNA MRGs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.
