Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is at the forefront of the global spectrum of cancer incidence and mortality, with conventional therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors limited by resistance.
Recent studies have highlighted the promising anticancer effects of nitidine chloride (NC) against HCC.
SAC3 domain containing 1 (SAC3D1) is critical for centrosome replication and spindle formation.
However, research on SAC3D1 in HCC and NC remains limited.
