Puberty suppression using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) is a reversible medical intervention that halts endogenous puberty, allowing transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) adolescents to avoid the development of secondary sexual characteristics that may cause psychological distress.
This pause in pubertal progression provides time to explore gender identity or facilitates alignment with affirmed gender in those with an established identity.
While widely used, long-term evidence on the efficacy and safety of GnRHa in this population remains limited.
This systematic review aims to synthesize current data on the benefits and potential risks of GnRHa in TGD adolescents.
