Irradiation and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are widely utilized tools in hematopoietic research to generate myeloablation and assess blood recovery dynamics.
A comprehensive understanding of their effects on the hematopoietic system is essential for optimizing therapeutic strategies, refining experimental models to modulate hematotoxicity, and interpreting research outcomes.
Despite their widespread application, the long-term hematopoietic impacts of irradiation and 5-FU, particularly on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), remain incompletely characterized.
In this study, we therefore examined the long-term effects of 2 Gy medium-dose ionizing radiation (MDIR) and 150â€¯mg/kg 5-FU on HSCs and the hematopoietic system's resilience to subsequent cytotoxic stress in mice.
Our findings demonstrate that MDIR, but not 5-FU, induces sustained impairments in HSC function and results in the selective depletion of MHC class II
