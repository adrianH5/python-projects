Cancer is a major public health concern, particularly among middle-aged and elderly populations, who are disproportionately affected by rising cancer incidence.
Environmental pollution has been identified as a significant risk factor for cancer development.
China's Carbon Emission Trading Policy (CETP), implemented in pilot regions since 2013, aims to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality.
This study evaluates the impact of CETP on pan-cancer incidence, with a focus on its effects on specific cancer types and vulnerable populations.
