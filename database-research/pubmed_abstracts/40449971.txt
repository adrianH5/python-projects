Cancer's complex nature and personal variety make it among the toughest cancers to conquer.
Innovative treatment strategies can be achieved through new biotechnology developments.
DNA and mRNA vaccinations deliver an opportunity to take a new path for cancer.
The ways in which DNA and mRNA vaccinations generate immune reactions that specifically focus on cancer cells are discussed in this section.
This chapter focuses on the development and creation of these vaccines.
We will focus on the latest research that proves the effectiveness of these vaccines and their safety over different types of cancer.
Also, we discuss the technological and biological barriers in the process of vaccine development that hinder the development of these vaccines, such as the stability of delivery methods and a patient-specific design for vaccines.
DNA and mRNA vaccinations are an important therapeutic approach against cancer with genetic information.
They offer an opportunity for the future to develop tailored as well as more efficient treatment options.
