This study reports the facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of water-soluble perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) conjugated carbon quantum dots (Per CDs) and their folate conjugate (PerFACDs), addressing the insolubility of PTCDA, a promising photosensitizer.
Both CDs were thoroughly characterized using HRTEM, FTIR, Raman, and XPS techniques.
Their singlet oxygen quantum yield (Î¦
