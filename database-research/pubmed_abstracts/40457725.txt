The medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase-5 (ACSM5) plays a crucial role in the development of some cancers.
However, its impact on liver cancer is still not clear.
In this study, we found that the proliferation ability of LM3 and HepG2 cells was significantly inhibited after ACSM5 was overexpressed, and this change was blocked by the ferroptosis inhibitor deferoxamine.
ACSM5 increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced the level of glutathione (GSH), and thus triggered ferroptosis.
Furthermore, ACSM5 promoted the upregulation of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR).
Knocking down POR blocked the promoting effect of ACSM5 on ferroptosis in HCC.
Moreover, ACSM5 promoted the generation of arachidonic acid and thus increased the sensitivity to ferroptosis.
In summary, our findings indicate that ACSM5 induces ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by upregulating POR.
The metabolic transformation of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid was also promoted by ACSM5; therefore, sensitivity to ferroptosis was increased.
