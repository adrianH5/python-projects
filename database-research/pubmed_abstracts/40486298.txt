Pancreatic neoplasms are associated with high morbidity and mortality, largely due to late diagnosis and challenges in accurate staging.
Multiphasic computed tomography (CT) is a critical imaging tool for evaluating pancreatic masses offering detailed information on lesion characterization and surgical resectability.
Precise radiological assessment is vital for treatment planning, and correlating imaging findings with histopathology improves diagnostic efficiency.
