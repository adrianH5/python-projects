The sudden rise of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the delay in development of effective therapeutics for mitigation made evident a need for ways to screen compounds that can block infection and prevent further pathogenesis and spread.
However, identifying effective drugs that are efficacious against viral infection and replication with minimal toxicity for the patient can be difficult.
Monoclonal antibodies were shown to be effective, but as the SARS-CoV-2 mutated, these antibodies became ineffective.
Small-molecule antivirals were identified using pseudovirus constructs to recapitulate infection in nonhuman cells, such as Vero E6 cells.
However, the impact was limited due to poor translation of these compounds in the clinical setting.
This is partly due to the lack of similarity of screening platforms to the
