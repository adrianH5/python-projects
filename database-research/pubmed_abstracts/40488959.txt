Breast cancer is the second deadliest cancer among women after lung cancer.
Though the breast cancer death rate continues to decline in the past 20Â years, the stages IV and III breast cancer death rates remain high.
Therefore, an automated breast cancer diagnosis system is of great significance for early screening of breast lesions to improve the survival rate of patients.
This paper proposes a deep learning-based network hybrid adaptive attention deep supervision-guided U-Net (HAA-DSUNet) for breast lesion segmentation of breast ultrasound computed tomography (BUCT) images, which replaces the traditionally sampled convolution module of U-Net with the hybrid adaptive attention module (HAAM), aiming to enlarge the receptive field and probe rich global features while preserving fine details.
Moreover, we apply the contrast loss to intermediate outputs as deep supervision to minimize the information loss during upsampling.
Finally, the segmentation prediction results are further processed by filtering, segmentation, and morphology to obtain the final results.
We conducted the experiment on our two UCT image datasets HCH and HCH-PHMC, and the highest Dice score is 0.8729 and IoU is 0.8097, which outperform all the other state-of-the-art methods.
It is demonstrated that our algorithm is effective in segmenting the legion from BUCT images.
