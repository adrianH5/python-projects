Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibiting microsatellite instability (MSI)-high generally demonstrate a favorable response to immunotherapy.
In contrast, the efficacy of immunotherapy in microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC patients is considerably restricted.
This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of immunotherapy in MSS patients characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) as opposed to those with homologous recombination proficiency (HRP).
