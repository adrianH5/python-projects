Previous research suggests that exposures to air pollution and nonoptimal temperatures are associated with a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but few studies examined the exposures jointly.
Furthermore, moderate exposures were often overlooked.
We evaluated short-term exposure to ambient ozone pollution and ambient temperature jointly and over the entire range of exposures, with the occurrence of AMI among adults aged 18 to 64 years (an understudied population) in the contiguous United States.
