Urothelial carcinoma (UC) accounts for more than 90% of all bladder cancers both in humans and dogs.
Human and canine UC share many genetic mutations and tumor markers and clinical and therapeutic interventions.
The unmet clinical needs are similar such as the early detection and treatment of the high-grade residual disease responsible for tumor recurrence and progression.
The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the α5β1 integrin and its specificity in high-grade UC in humans and dogs, a marker recently reported in the human bladder
