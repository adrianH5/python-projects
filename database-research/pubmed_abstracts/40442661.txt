Municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs) are widely used for waste management.
However, the health effects of their emissions remain uncertain, needing further investigation and monitoring of the potential risks associated with such exposure.
The aim of this study is to update and synthesize evidence on the health effects of residential exposure to MSWIs.
