Neurological involvement in Behçet's syndrome is rare but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Two subtypes of neuro-Behçet's disease (NBD) are typically described: parenchymal and non-parenchymal.
Among parenchymal manifestations, some cases of inflammatory pseudotumoural lesions have been reported, occasionally requiring a brain biopsy to differentiate them from central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms or infections.
We present a new case of cerebral pseudotumour in a patient without a prior diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome.
We review the literature, highlighting the distinguishing features in comparison with typical parenchymal neuro-Behçet's disease.
