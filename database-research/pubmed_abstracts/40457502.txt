Non-cancer deaths are now becoming a significant threat to the health of cancer patients.
Death from atherosclerosis is linked to cancer due to the side effects of treatment and its pathogenesis.

In this study, we aimed to identify the correlation between various outcomes and the risk of death from atherosclerosis as well as to determine which cancer subtypes are linked to a higher risk of mortality from atherosclerosis.
