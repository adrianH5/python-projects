Gastric cancer (GC) is a widespread cancerous disease with an unfavorable prognosis, linc01105 appears to have a significant connection with the development of GC, but the precise regulatory mechanism remains obscure.
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to determine the expression of linc01105, miR-650, and TCEA3.
Proliferative capacity of GC cells was measured by CCK8.
Cell apoptosis rates were analyzed via flow cytometry assessment.
The invasive capability was assessed through the Transwell experiment.
The targeted regulation of linc01105, miR-650, and TCEA3 was validated through dual luciferase reporter gene assay.
Low expression of linc01105, high expression of miR-650, and low expression of TCEA3 were observed in GC tumor tissues and cell lines.
High expression of linc01105 was correlated with a positive prognosis in GC patients.
linc01105 affected GC cell function by miR-650/TCEA3 axis.
This study suggested that linc01105 may possess inhibitory functions towards GC.
In addition, linc01105 may be a prognostic marker for GC.
