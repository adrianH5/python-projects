The complex procedures of ultralow anterior resection and intersphincteric resection require precise manipulation at the deepest pelvis, where the advantages of robotic surgery in particular could be leveraged, despite limited reports of such procedures.
We aimed to evaluate the short-term outcomes of robot-assisted ultralow anterior resection and robot-assisted intersphincteric resection at 31 institutions in Japan.
