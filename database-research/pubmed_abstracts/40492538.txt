Cardiac troponin (cTn) levels exceeding the 99th percentile upper reference limit and a rise/fall pattern are key for diagnosing myocardial injury and infarction.
Macrotroponins, formed by patient anti-cTn antibodies targeting cTn, can cause persistently elevated cTn levels without ongoing myocardial injury.
The frequency and impact of macrotroponin interference on cTn 99th percentiles are unclear.
This study compares sex-specific 99th percentiles for 2 cTn assays, before and after excluding macrotroponin-positive samples, focusing on the top 10% of cTn levels.
