Periprosthetic fracture (PPF) is a troublesome complication as it utilizes substantial healthcare resources.
Recent studies about the epidemiology of PPF after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are still lacking, and there is limited national-level analysis focusing on the comorbid chronic conditions as risk factors of PPF.
This study used national registry data from South Korea and aimed to investigate the epidemiology of PPF following TKA between 2010 and 2020 and identify which comorbidities contributed to the risk of PPF.
