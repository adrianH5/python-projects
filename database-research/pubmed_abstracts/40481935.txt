Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent and highly aggressive subtype of kidney cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the roles of lactate metabolism and immune-related genes (LMRGs) in its prognosis and immune microenvironment remain unclear.
Until now, no studies have explored the potential impact of LMRGs on the prognosis of ccRCC and their relationship with the tumor immune microenvironment.
