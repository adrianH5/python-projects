In hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage breast cancer (BC), cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibition (CDK4/6i) combined with endocrine therapy could represent a less toxic alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
The NEOLBC trial studied whether neoadjuvant ribociclib plus letrozole (RL) gives a doubling in complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA; Ki67 <1% on immunohistochemistry) as compared to chemotherapy (CT) in the surgical specimen in luminal BC.
