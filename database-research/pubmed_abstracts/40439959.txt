Survival outcomes associated with different androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) prescribed for the treatment of metastatic castration (hormone)-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) have not been directly compared.
The objective of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) by 24 months among ARPI-naïve patients with mCSPC initiating apalutamide or enzalutamide.
