Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignancy worldwide, occurring frequently on sun-exposed areas including the head and neck, where it is associated with relatively greater morbidity and complexity in treatment.
The mainstay of treatment is surgical excision.
Local recurrence has been shown to be reduced following excision with adequate microscopic margins; however, up to 25% of all excisions result in close or involved margins.
This places great stress on the health system.
The risk factors for incomplete excision are not yet fully understood.
Our study aims to identify risk factors that contribute to incomplete or close margins in head and neck BCCs in an Australian tertiary Plastic and Reconstructive surgery unit.
