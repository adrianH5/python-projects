Galectins consist of a highly conserved carbohydrate recognition domain that involves in functional cellular activities including cell growth, cell proliferation and adhesion, signal transduction, and others.
It has been reported that galectins play varying roles in distinct tissue types and have been implicated in different diseases, including cancer.
Each of these proteins have its specific function and studies on the role of galectins in colorectal cancer mostly focusing on galectin-1, -3, -4, and -9.
Thus, this review highlights the role of certain galectins in colorectal cancer, as well as their involvement in clinical trials.
