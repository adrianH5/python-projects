Locally acting antiplatelet and anticoagulant (APAC) is developed as an antithrombotic agent for administration during vascular interventions and in thrombo-inflammatory conditions.
APAC has entered human studies as a dual inhibitor of von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet recruitment on collagen and thrombin generation.
We aimed to assess safety and escalating intravenous (i.v.)
doses of APAC on hemostasis using a large animal model.
