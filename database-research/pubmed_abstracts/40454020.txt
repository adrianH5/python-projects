Nanofibrous scaffolds based on biomaterials have recently received a lot of attention due to their unique physicochemical characteristics.
In this article, we disclose the encapsulation of bromelain in a poly-(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) matrix to create a new type of nanofibrous scaffold.
Bromelain has been used to impart new properties to PVA/HEC nanofibrous scaffolds, such as antibacterial, antioxidant, and biocompatibility.
After examining the physicochemical properties of the nanofibrous scaffolds, it was discovered that bromelain was successfully incorporated into PVA/HEC nanofibers, providing a significant morphological structure to the scaffolds.
