Glioma, a prevalent brain tumor originating from glial cells, exhibits rapid growth, high recurrence, and significant invasiveness.
Standard treatments include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, yet their effectiveness remains unsatisfactory.
Recent studies implicate oxidative stress in promoting glioma cell proliferation and migration, as well as enhancing survival rates, suggesting antioxidant therapy as a potential tumor treatment strategy.
