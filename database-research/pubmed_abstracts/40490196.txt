GATA family transcription factors are somatically variable (SV) in esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) and inducible by simulated reflux.
Our study examines the mechanisms whereby GATA family members, GATA4, GATA6 and the atypical TRPS-1, influence oncogenesis during the Barrett's esophagus (BE) metaplasia-dysplasia transition preceding EAC.
