Matrix Gla protein (MGP) has been found to be strongly associated with cancer progression.
However, its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains unclear, particularly within the tumor immune microenvironment.
MGP may promote immune evasion by activating the nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enha ncer of activated B-cells (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway, which increases the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and contributes to CD8
