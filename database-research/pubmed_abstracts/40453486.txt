To evaluate the prognostic performance of the ProstatypeÂ® score (P-score) in the Asian prostate cancer (PCa) cohort and to assess its ability to refine risk stratification compared to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.
This study aimed to determine whether the P-score, previously validated in European populations, maintains its predictive accuracy in a genetically and clinically distinct high-risk Asian cohort, where late-stage diagnosis is more common.
