Motivation for the study.
Restrictions on advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (APS) of unhealthy food and beverage products aim to reduce their consumption and protect public health.
No reviews have yet evaluated the impact of restricting APS of sugary drinks (SD).
Main findings.
We found that comprehensive policies that include TV advertising restrictions, as well as restrictions at points of sale and in schools, can effectively reduce SD consumption, especially among children and adolescents, decrease obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and generate economic benefits.
Implications.
Evidence on the health impact of such interventions is essential to promote effective measures.
