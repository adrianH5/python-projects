Despite advances in systemic therapy, survival in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains poor.
The utility of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), allowing dose escalation to achieve improved local control has risen in the treatment of mCRC.
However, local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) varies widely between studies, and prognostic factors are not well defined.
