Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a high rate of postoperative recurrence.
Postoperative adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) is effective in preventing recurrence.
However, the effect of different courses of PA-TACE on tumor prognosis remains unclear.
As such, this study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram that incorporates different courses of PA-TACE to predict early tumor recurrence.
