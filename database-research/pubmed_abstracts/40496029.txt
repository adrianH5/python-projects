Breast cancer is a major global health concern among all malignancies, with HER2-positive breast cancer representing a particularly aggressive subtype.
It affects approximately 20% of patients and is associated with a high risk of relapse.
The management of HER2-positive breast cancer has been significantly improved by targeted therapies, though challenges remain, especially in resource-limited settings.
Invasive fungal infections are also common and can manifest as metastatic lesions in immunocompromised cancer patients undergoing intensive treatments making the diagnosis challenging for the oncologists.
