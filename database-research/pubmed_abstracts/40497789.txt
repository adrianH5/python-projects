Retained hemothorax (rHTX) occurs when blood persists in the pleural space beyond 72 hours.
While initial management involves chest tube placement, failure often necessitates surgical intervention.
Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/DNase is a nonoperative alternative, but failure rates remain high (>20%).
Prior work in pleural infections suggests fibrinolytic failure results from plasminogen degradation by neutrophil proteases.
We hypothesized that rHTX is a similarly inflamed environment where plasminogen depletion impairs fibrinolysis.
