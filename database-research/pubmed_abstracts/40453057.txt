Venetoclax with azacitidine is the standard of care for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy; however, uncertainties remain regarding the treatment schedule, accurate prognostication, and outcomes for patients treated outside clinical trials.
The option of venetoclax with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) is also available; however, it is not clear for which patients it may be a useful alternative.
Here, we report a large real-world cohort of 654 patients treated in 53 UK hospitals with either venetoclax and azacitidine (n = 587) or LDAC (n = 67).
The median age was 73 years, and 59% had de novo AML.
Most patients received 100 mg of venetoclax with an azole antifungal.
In cycle 1, patients spent a median of 14 days in the hospital, and 85% required red cell transfusion, 59% platelet transfusion, and 63% required IV antibiotics.
Supportive care requirements significantly reduced after the first cycle.
Patients receiving venetoclax-azacitidine had a complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematological recovery rate of 67%, day 30 and day 60 mortality of 5% and 8%, respectively, and median overall survival of 13.6 months.
