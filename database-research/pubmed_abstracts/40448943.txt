In the United Kingdom (UK), 1 in 13 people living with dementia also have cancer.
At some point, 41.3% of this population group will require care home support.
Limited research has examined the care and support needs of people with dementia and comorbid cancer (DCC) in nursing homes (NHs).
This study aimed to explore the care experiences of NH residents with DCC, their families, nursing home staff (NHS) and healthcare professionals (HCPs), and to identify challenges and good practices, to develop recommendations for practice improvement.
