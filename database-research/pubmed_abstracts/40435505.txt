Advances in cancer therapy have improved patient outcomes, but cardiotoxicity remains a significant risk.
In melanoma patients treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, monitoring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during treatment is recommended to detect cardiac dysfunction.
Despite the widespread use of FDG-PET in oncology, its potential for concurrent cardiac assessment remains underexplored.
