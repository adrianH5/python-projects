The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), published in 2023, was adapted in July 2024, according to established standard methodology, to produce the Pan-Asian adapted ESMO consensus guideline for the management of Asian patients with EOC.
The adapted guideline presented in this manuscript represents the consensus opinions reached by a panel of Asian experts in the treatment of patients with EOC representing the oncological societies of China, Indonesia, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, coordinated by ESMO and the Indian Society of Medical and Pediatric Oncology.
Voting was based on scientific evidence and was independent of current treatment practices, drug access restrictions and reimbursement decisions in the represented countries.
Drug access and reimbursement across Asia are discussed separately in the manuscript.
The Pan-Asian consensus aims to guide the optimisation and harmonisation of management of patients with EOC in Asia, drawing on the evidence provided by both Western and Asian trials.
Attention is drawn to the disparity in the drug approvals and reimbursement strategies between countries.
