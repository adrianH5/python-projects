The Sexual and Relationship Distress Scale (SaRDS) is a validated instrument developed in English to assess intra-personal and inter-personal distress experienced by individuals and their partners in the context of sexual dysfunction.
However, it has not yet been translated into Chinese nor psychometrically evaluated within Chinese clinical cancer and nonclinical populations.
