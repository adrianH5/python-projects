Obesity-related cancers are increasing globally, driven by metabolic disturbances and circadian rhythm disruptions.
Circadian rhythms regulate physiological processes, and their misalignment has been linked to increased cancer risk.
Chrononutrition, which aligns dietary intake with the body's circadian clock, has emerged as a potential strategy for cancer prevention and treatment.
This review explored the intricate relationship between circadian rhythm, metabolism, and cancer, highlighting the role of meal timing, macronutrient distribution, fasting, and ketogenic diets.
Additionally, the potential synergy between chrononutrition and cancer therapies was discussed, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches.
Future research should focus on integrating chrononutritional strategies into clinical practice to enhance treatment outcomes and improve quality of life in patients with obesity-related cancers.
