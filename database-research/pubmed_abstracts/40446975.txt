Compound Kushen Injection (CKI), a traditional Chinese medicine that has been clinically used for the treatment of various malignancies for over two decades, is prepared by purifying two traditional Chinese medicinal herbs: Sophora flavescens Aiton (Kushen) and Heterosmilax japonica Kunth (Baituling).
The most abundant active component, matrine, which is derived from Sophora flavescens Aiton, has also been reported in cancer treatment.
However, it has effects on breast cancer lung metastasis and underlying molecular mechanisms that remain incompletely understood.
