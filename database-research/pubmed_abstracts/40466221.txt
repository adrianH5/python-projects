Chrysotoxine, a bioactive bibenzyl derivative isolated from Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindal, has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic candidate for cervical cancer.
This study described an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of chrysotoxine in liver microsomes.
The developed method showed excellent linearity over the concentration range of 5-1500â€¯nM, which is suitable for in vitro high-throughput screening.
Chrysotoxine showed poor stability in monkey liver microsomes, with an in vitro elimination half-life (t
