Ultrasound-guided transverse thoracic plane (TTP) block has been shown to be highly effective in relieving postoperative pain in a variety of surgeries involving the anterior chest wall.
Accurate identification of the target structure on ultrasound images is key to the successful implementation of TTP block.
Nevertheless, the complexity of anatomical structures in the targeted blockade area coupled with the potential for adverse clinical incidents presents considerable challenges, particularly for anesthesiologists who are less experienced.
This study applied deep learning methods to TTP block and developed a deep learning model to achieve real-time region segmentation in ultrasound to assist doctors in the accurate identification of the target nerve.
Using 2329 images from 155 patients, we successfully segmented key structures associated with TTP areas and nerve blocks, including the transversus thoracis muscle, lungs, and bones.
The achieved IoU (Intersection over Union) scores are 0.7272, 0.9736, and 0.8244 in that order.
Recall metrics were 0.8305, 0.9896, and 0.9336 respectively, whilst Dice coefficients reached 0.8421, 0.9866, and 0.9037, particularly with an accuracy surpassing 97% in the identification of perilous lung regions.
The real-time segmentation frame rate of the model for ultrasound video was as high as 42.7 fps, thus meeting the exigencies of performing nerve blocks under real-time ultrasound guidance in clinical practice.
This study introduces TTP-Unet, a deep learning model specifically designed for TTP block, capable of automatically identifying crucial anatomical structures within ultrasound images of TTP block, thereby offering a practicable solution to attenuate the clinical difficulty associated with TTP block technique.
