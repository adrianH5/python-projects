Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), is more strongly expressed in triple negative-breast cancer (TNBC) than other subtypes of breast cancer and closely associated with aggressiveness characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis.
The main function of survivin is to regulate cell division and prevent apoptosis.
However, other survivin mechanisms are complex and not fully understood.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of survivin knockout on TNBC progressiveness relating to proliferation, apoptosis, stemness, cellular stress response, and metastasis mechanisms.
