Follicular lymphoma (FL), a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) originating from follicular center B cells, is clinically highly heterogeneous.
Its typical immunophenotype is CD5- CD10+ CD19+ with t(14;18) (q32;q21).
Liquid-based preparation and smear microscopic examination are common laboratory methods in patients with tumor invasion in the serous cavity.
