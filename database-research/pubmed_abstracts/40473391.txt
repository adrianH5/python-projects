A 68-year-old man with muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy and ileal conduit for urinary diversion using the Wallace procedure.
Two months after surgery, the patient developed recurrent urinary tract infections, and computed tomography showed left hydronephrosis.
Nephrostography revealed a left ureteroileal anastomotic obstruction.
Ho-YAG laser-assisted incision and transureter dilatation were performed 6 months after surgery.
Nephrostography performed 1 month after dilatation confirmed improvement of the obstructed area and no symptom recurrence.
