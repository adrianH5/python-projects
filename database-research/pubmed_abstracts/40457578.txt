Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is currently widely indicated for treatment of breast cancer (BC), due to several advantages that include early introduction of systemic therapy, determine drug's efficacy, potential to reduce both the tumor volume of the primary tumor andÂ regional lymph nodes, reduction in the extent of surgery in the breast and axilla, evaluation of the pathological response, and rescue therapies in specific cases.
Several studies have demonstrated better long-term outcomes among patients who achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) than those with residual tumor (non-pCR).
The association between pCR and long-term outcomes is strongest among HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
Therefore, evaluating the efficacy of chemotherapy in real time is an important issue.
