Achieving multiple antitumor efficacy in a single nanostructure is important for the development of photo-functional nanomedicines.
In this paper, we report a direct triplet state energy converter (NCPRB) based on lanthanide nanocrystals, which can reduce the loss of near-infrared (NIR) light and improve the efficiency of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce ferroptosis through the process of direct energy transfer from rare earth ions (Nd
