Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a major clinical problem.
This paper integrates the evidence-based literature and professional guidelines to support a proposed systematic approach to CRF diagnosis and management.
This approach includes four diagnostic criteria, six steps for routine care and two major evidence-based treatment modalities.
These comprise non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions.
This approach can reduce CRF management barriers while highlighting the illness trajectory phase when specific interventions will be most effective.
