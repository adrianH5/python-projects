In this study, 102 cisplatin-ineligible patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who received neoadjuvant RC48-ADC combined with immunotherapy were included.
We evaluated the pathological responses and explored multiple clinical characteristics to identify independent predictive indicators of the efficacy.
The results showed that neoadjuvant RC48-ADC combined with immunotherapy had promising efficacy.
Furthermore, we collected 11 MIBC samples and performed single-cell RNA sequencing.
All BLCA epithelial cells were identified as four subclusters.
We conducted differential gene expression/functional enrichment analysis, cell proportion analysis, cell cycle analysis, CNV analysis, and pseudotemporal analysis on all tumor cells to evaluate potential efficacy-predictive biomarkers and the evolutionary patterns of tumor cells during neoadjuvant treatment.
The results indicated that the combined detection of HER2 and HSPA1A expression in C3 subcluster based on single-cell RNA sequencing is a potential strategy for predicting efficacy.
In addition, C3 plays a dominant role in the emergence of drug-resistance during the evolution of BLCA epithelial cells.
