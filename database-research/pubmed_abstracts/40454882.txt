Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, particularly through right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.
Cancer antigen 125 (CA125), a biomarker traditionally used in ovarian cancer, has shown potential as an indicator of RV dysfunction.
This study aims to compare CA125 levels between OSA patients and controls and to evaluate its association with disease severity and subclinical RV dysfunction.
