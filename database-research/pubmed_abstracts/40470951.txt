Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) has become vital in the management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) with the paradigm shift from tumor eradication to functional preservation.
Several facial nerve (FN) monitoring strategies have been explored over the past few decades ranging from free-running electromyography, direct nerve stimulation, continuous nerve stimulation, facial motor evoked potentials, blink reflex, and others.
Hearing preservation surgery is guided primarily by far-field auditory brainstem response and real-time cochlear nerve action potentials.
Given the heterogeneity in tumor and patient factors, it remains very difficult to accurately predict cranial nerve outcomes, regardless of the monitoring strategy.
