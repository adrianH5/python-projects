Mesenchymal Stem Cells-derived Small Extracellular Vesicles endowed with regenerative cargo from their parent cells, have emerged as a promising avenue for cell-free therapeutics in regenerative medicine.
Notably, deliberate induction of apoptosis in MSCs before sEV isolation has been identified as a strategy to augment the regenerative capabilities of MSCs-sEVs.
This study explores a novel approach to enhance the immunomodulatory potential of MSC-sEVs through apoptosis induction and optimal tissue source to ensure consistent and improved clinical outcomes.
