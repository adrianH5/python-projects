A subset of superficial angiomyxomas contains epithelial elements.
Rarely, especially in Carney's complex patients, arborizing adnexal proliferations are present, with some authors proposing that they could be authentic adnexal neoplasms.
Our aim was to determine if the epithelial elements are trapped adnexal epithelium, epithelial outgrowths triggered by myxoid tumour cells or genuinely neoplastic.
