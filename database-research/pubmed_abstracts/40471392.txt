In Cushing's disease, the rate of endocrine remission after surgery reaches 80% in expert centers.
However, due to the tumor's capacity to invade surrounding dural structures, hypercortisolism persists in 20% of patients or recurs in 15%.
To improve the likelihood of remission, tumor resection can be extended to the dura in patients who show basal dura invasion.
The objective was to evaluate the benefit of a surgical strategy based on a systematic focus on the basal dura.
