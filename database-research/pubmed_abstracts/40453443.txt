Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast is distinct among breast cancer subtypes due to its unique metastatic patterns, including the involvement of the liver, genital tract, and gastrointestinal tract.
As ILC often exhibits low-grade fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity, the role of fluorine-18 FDG (F-18 FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in evaluating this subtype remains under re-explored.
This case report highlights a rare presentation of ILC of the right breast with concurrent gastric and uterine metastases detected on F-18 FDG PET/CT, emphasizing its diagnostic utility.
