Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease.
However, the pathogeny of IPF is poorly understood, and therapeutic options are very limited.
Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to dysbiosis of both the oral microbiome and host immune responses.
While previous studies have suggested a PD-IPF association, insights into the mechanisms remain limited.
