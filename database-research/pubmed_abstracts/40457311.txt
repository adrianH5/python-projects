Axillary dissection has been shown to be equivalent to axillary radiotherapy in the AMAROS trial; however, extracapsular invasion of sentinel lymph nodes was not considered among the evaluated variables.
The clinical significance of extracapsular extension (ECE) in one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes remains under investigation.
This study aims to evaluate the impact of targeted axillary radiation therapy while omitting completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the presence of extracapsular extension.
