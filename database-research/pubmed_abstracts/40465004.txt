Cancer is a significant global health concern, with its prevalence continuing to rise steadily.
Early detection is vital for improving treatment outcomes and survival rates by enabling timely intervention and effective disease management.
Biosensors have emerged as crucial tools in cancer diagnosis, offering high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid detection of biomarkers.
Among them, nanomaterial-based biosensors have gained significant attention due to their unique properties, including enhanced biocompatibility, stability, and large surface area for biomolecule interaction.
These sensors utilize materials like metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, and other nanomaterials, which amplify signals and improve detection limits, making them highly effective for identifying cancer at its earliest stages.
Their adaptability and potential for multiplexed detection further highlight their value in advancing cancer diagnostics and treatment strategies.
This review explores recent advancements in nanomaterial-based biosensors for detecting cancer-related biomarkers, highlighting their critical role in early diagnosis.
Key biomarkers covered include CA15-3, GPC3, Cyfra 21-1, CA-125, CRT, PDGF, PSA, miRNA-122, Anti-P53, YES1, CEA, PSMA, miR-141, c-Met protein, miR-106b, HER-2, Pax-5a, mSEPT9, and miR-21.
By focusing on studies conducted between 2022 and 2025, the review addresses emerging applications and future prospects of these biosensors.
