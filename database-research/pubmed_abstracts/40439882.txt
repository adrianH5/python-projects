Indenoisoquinolines are a class of topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors designed to overcome clinical limitations of camptothecins.
Three indenoisoquinolines (LMP400, LMP776, and LMP744) demonstrated activity in murine models and a comparative canine lymphoma study.
Clinical data for LMP400 were previously reported (NCT01051635).
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and clinical data from phase 1 studies of LMP776 (NCT01051635) and LMP744 (NCT03030417) are reported herein.
