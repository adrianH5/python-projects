Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) is recommended for surveillance 2-3 years after curative resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, supporting clinical evidence is limited.
This study compared LDCT with contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CECT) in terms of recurrence detection and overall survival (OS) in patients two years after curative resection of NSCLC.
