Disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) and LIM and Src homology 3 region (SH3) domain protein 1 (LASP1) have been shown to play a role in the course of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
However, the specific regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated.
The aim of this work was to investigate the role and interaction between DAB2 and LASP1 in the development of NSCLC.
