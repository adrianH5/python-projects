Colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma (MC) differs from adenocarcinoma (AD) in clinical features and molecular characteristics.
The current treatment of colorectal MC is not precise enough, and the molecular characteristics remain unclear.
The study aims to explore the difference between colorectal MC and AD on the transcriptome level for the possibility of treating colorectal MC precisely.
