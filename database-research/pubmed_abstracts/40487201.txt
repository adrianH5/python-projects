In the U.S., race and education have proven to be critical determinants of health outcomes inequalities, influenced by both location and time.
Lung cancer (primarily linked to smoking), along with drug overdoses, alcohol poisoning, and suicide, emerge as important contributors to mortality risk.
The purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of geographic disparities in mortality related to lung cancer and external causes of death in the U.S.
This study focuses on a finer geographic scale while examining the components of variation in mortality rates, stratifying by both education and race.
