The midbody (MB), a transient structure formed during cytokinesis, has evolved from a mere structural component to a complex signaling organelle with diverse functions beyond cell division.
Recent studies have revealed that jettisoned midbody remnants (MBRs) play crucial roles in intercellular communication, influencing cell fate decisions, particularly in stem cells and cancer.
MBRs act as large extracellular vesicles, transferring functional RNA and proteins that modulate cell behavior, including proliferation and cancer progression.
The protein KIF23, associated with midbodies, is a pan-cancer marker, underscoring the clinical relevance of MB research.
This review highlights the emerging significance of midbodies and MBRs in cancer biology, neurobiology, and regenerative medicine, offering new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
By reshaping our understanding of cell division and intercellular communication, these findings open exciting frontiers in cell biology with huge potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
