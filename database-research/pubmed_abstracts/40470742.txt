Hepatic cancer is the leading cause of worldwide death due to lack of effective chemotherapy drugs.
Cuproptosis is a novel regulated cell death and offers a new potential mechanism to eliminate hepatic cancer.
In this study, it is found that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the hepatic cancer, is sensitive to cuproptosis by analysing clinical specimens and databases.
Thus, a copper-based nanotube (NT) with copper ionophores to induce enhanced cuproptosis is designed.
In combination with starvation therapy, the NT significantly inhibited energy metabolism in HCC cells.
This results show that the depletion of GSH by Cu
