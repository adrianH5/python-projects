Spatial transcriptomics enables multiplex profiling of gene cellular expression and location within the tissue context.
Although large volumes of spatial transcriptomics data have been generated, the lack of systematic curation and analysis limits biological discovery.
We present Spatial transcriptOmics Analysis Resource (SOAR), a comprehensive spatial transcriptomics platform with 3461 uniformly processed samples across 13 species, 42 tissue types, and 19 different spatial transcriptomics technologies.
Using SOAR, we found that
