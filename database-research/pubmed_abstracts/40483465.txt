The incidence and prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a chronic liver disease characterized by hepatic steatosis without substantial alcohol consumption, are rapidly increasing worldwide.
Liver cirrhosis and cancer are relatively common in MASLD patients.
Therefore, it is essential to take proactive measures in preventing its onset or initiating prompt treatment.
However, there is a lack of approved medications for effectively treating this ailment.
Lipoic acid (LA), a compound with antioxidant, insulin-sensitization, anti-inflammatory, and prooxidant activities, has been proven to inhibit lipid deposition.
Many studies have shown that supplementation of LA can alleviate MASLD.
Therefore, the latest evidence on the relationship between LA and MASLD is presented in this review.
The effect of LA on the accumulation of fat in the liver is emphasized following different diet models (normal, high fat, high fructose, choline deficiency) and other models (gene mutation, diabetes), with the main mechanisms from mitochondrial function to inflammation and oxidative stress being summarized.
LA possesses excellent preventive effects on MASLD, which can provide new opportunities for clinical research.
