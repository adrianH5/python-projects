Poor tumor penetration and hypoxic microenvironments limit nanodrug efficacy.
In this study, we engineered a nanodrug delivery system via relay transcytosis mediated by stepwise targeting of GGT/CAIX to promote tumor penetration and antitumor efficacy.
The multifunctional polymer carrier, P1, was constructed via the Michael addition reaction.
DLS confirmed the micelle responsiveness.
