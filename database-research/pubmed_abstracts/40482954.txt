Aggressive pituitary neuroendocrine tumours and pituitary carcinomas are associated with high morbidity and mortality and have limited treatment options.
Increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of pituitary tumours has led to identification of molecular drivers of aggressive behaviour and prognostic markers, as well as identification of therapeutic targets.
Mechanisms for pituitary tumourigenesis include chromosomal genomic instability, defective DNA repair, loss of cell cycle control, epigenetic changes, dysregulation of intracellular signalling pathways and alterations within the pituitary tumour immune microenvironment.
Novel therapeutic treatment options including VEGF targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used with varied responses.
The application of precision oncology platforms to identify therapeutic targets is well described in other cancers and should be considered in the management of aggressive pituitary tumours and pituitary carcinomas.
Histopathological analysis of established prognostic markers should be included in routine clinical practice.
