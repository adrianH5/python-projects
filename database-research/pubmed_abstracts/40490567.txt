Non-Hodgkins's lymphoma (NHL) patients' body mass index (BMI), information needs, and self-efficacy to manage illness vary over the course of treatment and are correlated to their physical and psychological health.
The purpose of this study was to assess BMI, performance status, information needs, and self-efficacy to manage illness, and study their effects on symptom distress and anxiety in patients with NHL.
