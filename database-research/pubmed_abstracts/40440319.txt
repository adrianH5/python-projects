Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with most cases attributable to cigarette smoking.
People who identify as LGBTQ+ are more likely to smoke; however, there are limited interventions to support lung cancer prevention in this community.
Through prior community-engaged work we developed a patient navigation intervention to support smoking cessation and lung cancer screening (LCS) for LGBTQ+ adults.
