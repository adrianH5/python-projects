The circadian clock is present in nearly all tissues (including glial cells), which play crucial roles in brain functions and development.
Circadian clock genes (CCGs) are responsible for regulating numerous cancer-associated biological mechanisms, including the regulation of cell cycle genes, apoptosis, and cell proliferation.
A range of studies have already confirmed the potential link between brain tumors and CCGs, including
