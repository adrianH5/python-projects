Women with pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in BRCA1/2 genes have an increased lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
Cancer risk management options include intensive breast surveillance (IBS) and risk reducing mastectomy (RRM).
This study aims to compare the effect of these strategies on quality of life, anxiety, and depression to enhance shared decision-making.
