Type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves selective destruction of pancreatic beta (β) cells, mainly by infiltrating CD8+ T cells.
These CD8+ T cells also express immune-checkpoint molecules (ICMs) that can be targeted by immune-checkpoint ligands (ICLs) or β cell-specific Tregs.
Here, we combined both approaches to suppress autoimmune responses in T1D.
