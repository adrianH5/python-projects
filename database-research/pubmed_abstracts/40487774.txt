Chronic back pain (CBP) affects over 80 million people in Europe, contributing to substantial healthcare costs and disability.
Understanding modifiable risk factors, such as muscle composition, may aid in prevention and treatment.
This study investigates the association between lean muscle mass (LMM) and intermuscular adipose tissue (InterMAT) with CBP using noninvasive whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
