Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized by the genetic alteration BCR-ABL.
The introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, in 2002, inhibiting BCR-ABL signalling, has revolutionized CML therapy and is still one of the preferred first-line treatment options.
The present study aimed to assess possible differences in older and younger patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML treated with imatinib, with regards to remission rates, remission depth, remission duration or discontinuation of imatinib due to adverse events.
Data was collected retrospectively from the records of patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML treated with imatinib at the University Hospital Krems from January 2011 to December 2021.
Exclusion criteria included the administration of other first line therapies besides imatinib, an age of <18 years or other cancer types.
Overall, 22 patients were included in the present study and separated into two age groups: <60 and â‰¥60 years old.
The results revealed no significant difference in remission rates, remission depth, progression-free survival or overall survival between these age groups.
In conclusion, the findings indicate that the TKI, imatinib, is highly effective and well tolerated in both younger and older patients with CML.
However, further studies with larger patient groups and the inclusion of newer TKIs are required.
