Molecular imaging has experienced significant advances in the areas of imaging probes and technology, enabling the detection of tumors at earlier stages and more accurately identifying extent of disease.
To better characterize lesions, nuclear medicine modalities utilize molecular imaging agents targeting specific pathways and cell surface molecules to improve both sensitivity and specificity.
In the field of endocrinology, tumors encompass a wide spectrum of aggressiveness ranging from indolent, well differentiated tumors to highly aggressive cancers.
Thus, in recent years, new molecular imaging biomarkers have been developed for noninvasively assessing different types of hormone-producing tumors.
For instance,
