To prevent heat-steam-induced skin damage during robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (RNSMIBR).
Methods: Clinical data from 156 breast cancer patients undergoing RNSMIBR were analyzed retrospectively.
Patients were divided into three groups: no skin cooling (group A, 29 cases), gauze cooled by ice water (group B, 99 cases), and gauze with ice water combined with suction tubing (group C, 28 cases).
Key parameters such as age, BMI, and cancer pathology showed no significant differences across groups (P>0.05).
Intraoperative skin temperature, mastectomy duration, and complications from heat-steam-induced skin damage were recorded.
