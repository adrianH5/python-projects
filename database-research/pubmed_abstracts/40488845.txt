The thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT and its Pt complex were conjugated to coumarin-based fluorophores.
These conjugates proved to be versatile lysosome tracking agents.
Specifically, Pt complex 5 remained trapped and produced reliable fluorescence emission in the lysosomes of HeLa cancer cells over 72 h, revealing its potential as a robust lysosome tracker.
