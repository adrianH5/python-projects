Thyroid malignancies, while accounting for a small proportion of cancer diagnoses globally, have demonstrated a consistent upward trend in occurrence across diverse populations, with gender-specific analyses revealing a disproportionate burden among women.
Despite the characteristically indolent nature of most thyroid carcinomas and their associated high survival rates, emerging evidence points to significant unmet needs regarding psychosocial adaptation and neuropsychiatric sequelae in this growing survivor population.
The spectrum of mental health conditions, ranging from affective and anxiety disorders to cognitive impairments, presents substantial barriers to functional recovery and may potentially influence disease trajectories through complex psychoneuroimmunological pathways.
Clinical observations consistently report elevated rates of mood disturbances and executive function deficits persisting throughout the cancer continuum, from active treatment into extended follow-up periods.
These findings highlight a critical knowledge gap in understanding the dynamic interplay between thyroid cancer biology, its therapeutic interventions, and the development of treatment-resistant psychiatric manifestations that complicate long-term patient care.
