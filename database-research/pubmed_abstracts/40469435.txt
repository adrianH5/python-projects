Accurate evaluation of thyroid nodules is crucial for effective management; however, methods such as ultrasonography and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) can be subjective and operator-dependent.
Indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITNs) complicate diagnosis, coming at the expense of time, money, and potentially additional FNA samplings, causing more discomfort for the patients.
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) assisted ultrasound diagnosis system have demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance and the potential to aid in the differentiation of ITNs.
This study aims to develop an AI classifier that integrates the AI-assisted ultrasound diagnosis system, FNAC, and demographic data to enhance the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, and to compare the diagnostic performance of the models, with a focus on diagnosing ITNs.
