Nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) mediates inflammation-driven angiogenesis, which promotes growth of atherosclerotic plaques and tumors.
The deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 20 (USP20) suppresses NFκB activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and attenuates atherosclerosis, but the role of USP20 in endothelial cells (ECs) was undefined.
We tested whether USP20 activity diminishes NFκB signaling in ECs and thereby diminishes angiogenesis.
Cytokine-induced NFκB activity was elevated in primary ECs isolated from
