Metastasis, a significant hurdle in cancer treatment, is driven by genetic alterations that shape tumor evolution and dissemination.
Traditionally viewed as a late-stage event, recent evidence suggests that metastasis may initiate earlier in tumor progression than previously assumed.
Genomic studies have been instrumental in exploring this complex process, yet inconsistencies persist, with findings supporting both early and late metastatic events.
These discrepancies are likely due to methodological variations in how metastasis timing is inferred.
Additionally, biases in sampling and the heterogeneity of metastatic seeding further obscure precise assessments of metastatic divergence.
Addressing these challenges is essential to refining evolutionary models of metastasis, which will be crucial for advancing cancer research and improving therapeutic strategies.
In this review, we examine the challenges in accurately timing metastatic events and discuss how insights into early versus late dissemination can inform personalized therapeutic strategies.
Such perspectives can lead to more personalized and effective cancer management.
