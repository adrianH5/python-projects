In breast cancer, adipocytes are the predominant cell type in the microenvironment, and the continuous communication between these tissues alters the adipose phenotype.
However, molecular mechanisms promoting these changes are still poorly understood.
Previously, we demonstrated that NCoA3 expression is increased in adipose tissue adjacent to breast cancer and that this increase is associated with an inflammatory profile.
This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying NCoA3 expression in adipocytes within the breast tumor microenvironment.
We demonstrated that breast cancer-secreted TNF increases NCoA3 expression in adipocytes, and this upregulation is dependent on NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity.
Furthermore, the use of a TNF blocker prevented both coactivator overexpression and macrophages recruitment, mimicking the effects observed when NCoA3 expression was downregulated using a short hairpin RNA.
These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which breast cancer cells modulate adipocyte behavior, identifying NCoA3 as a key mediator in the tumor-adipose tissue crosstalk.
Targeting this pathway through TNF inhibition offers promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate tumor-associated inflammation and potentially improve outcomes in breast cancer patients.
