Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor outcomes.
Obesity is a risk factor for several cancers including PDAC due to metabolic dysregulation and inflammation.
The ketogenic diet (KD) can alter metabolism and has been evaluated for its effects on tumor progression in non-obese but not obese PDAC using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs).
We hypothesized that ketone bodies and a KD alter cell and tumor metabolism.
We show that ketone treatments altered pyrimidine metabolism in PDAC cells.
Moreover, in an obese PDAC GEMM, KD prevented tumor progression independent of weight loss but promoted PDAC in a non-obese PDAC GEMM.
The KD-specific delay of obesity-associated PDAC was associated with pancreatic metabolic shifts in pyrimidine, cysteine and methionine, and arginine and proline pathways.
These findings suggest potential benefits of a KD in preventing obesity-associated PDAC, but highlights some risks in non-obese settings.
