One diagnostic challenge in the field of gastroenterology is distinguishing between various types of polyps, including amebomas.
In this study, we aimed to develop a stronger perspective for professionals to differentiate amebomas from colon cancer based on the clinical and paraclinical findings of patients who were initially diagnosed with cancer but were later found to have amebomas.
The international scientific databases consulted for this article on January 6, 2023, 2023, comprised PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science.
Moreover, Google Scholar was employed to collect pertinent information.
The study included 12 articles about 12 patients with ameboma, mostly reported in Asian countries like India.
The patients were aged 27-77 years, with most in their fifties.
Common symptoms included abdominal pain (reported almost in all cases), fever (42 % of cases), constipation (33 %), diarrhea (16 %), vomiting and nausea (25 %), abdominal distention (25 %), weight loss (16 %), and hematochezia (16 %) other symptoms such as abdominal mass, anorexia and stiffness were reported in some cases with lower prevalences (8 % or lesss).
Diagnosis was mostly through histopathological examination, but Polymerase Chain Reaction, serological tests, and stool exams were also used.
The study highlights the significance of accurately diagnosing ameboma, which is frequently misidentified as colon cancer.
It underscores the necessity for improved diagnostic methods, including histopathological and microscopic evaluations, particularly in patients aged 50 and older, to identify ameboma as a possible cause of intestinal symptoms.
