Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have increasingly come to the forefront as promising blood biomarkers in the realm of cancer diagnosis and treatment, sparking intense interest in early cancer detection.
Nevertheless, considering that cancer is a complex, multistage disease, the detection of a single lncRNA alone is insufficient to precisely mirror the progression of the disease.
In the present study, we devised a sophisticated dual-mode sensing strategy that ingeniously combined fluorescent and electrochemical modalities through a cascade amplification reaction, which allowed for the concurrent identification of lncRNA MALAT1 and HOTAIR.
In the presence of MALAT1 and HOTAIR, the corresponding DNAzyme activities were activated.
