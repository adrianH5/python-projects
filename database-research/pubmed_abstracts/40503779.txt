The prognostic equivalence of total hysterectomy (TH) versus radical hysterectomy (RH) in early-stage cervical cancer (IA2-IB1) with tumor size ≤2 cm remains controversial, particularly regarding the necessity of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) assessment.
This study evaluates survival outcomes under simplified criteria omitting LVSI and depth of invasion evaluation.
