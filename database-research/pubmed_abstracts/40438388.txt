Cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) exhibit significant plasticity, making them more tumorigenic, invasive, and stem-like.
PLCG2 has been identified as being linked to EMT.
Specifically, the PLCG2-high subpopulation of tumor cells shows strong correlations with metastasis.
However, it remains unclear whether PLCG2 serves as a direct driver of EMT.
In this study, we employ an
