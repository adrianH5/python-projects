Ovarian cancer is reported to be one of the most morbid gynecological cancers, often diagnosed at advanced stages.
Primary debulking surgery (PDS) along with chemotherapy is the treatment of choice; however, there is a high probability of suboptimal excision.
Thus, each patient should be evaluated for the appropriate treatment modality and PDS should be deferred as the risk of surgical complications and delay in chemotherapy consequently impacts survival.
It is imperative to formulate a predictive model to select patients for optimal debulking surgery.
