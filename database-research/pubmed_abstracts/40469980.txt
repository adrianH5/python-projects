Early-life stress (ELS) is a well-established risk factor for adolescent depression, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a key serotonergic center, demonstrates stress-induced synaptic impairments that may underlie depressive phenotypes.
Sinisan (SNS), a classical Chinese herbal formula, shows clinical efficacy against mood disorders, but its effects on adolescent stress-induced DRN synaptic damage are unknown.
