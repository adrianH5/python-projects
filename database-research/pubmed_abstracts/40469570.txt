Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignant disease with poor survival outcomes.
The aim of this study was to investigate leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and redox status parameters during chemotherapy and evaluate their prognostic potential based on the hypothesis that shorter LTL and oxidative stress burden correlate with poorer survival.
