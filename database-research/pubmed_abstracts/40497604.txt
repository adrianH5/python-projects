In the tumor microenvironment, regulatory T cells (Treg cells), a small subset of CD4+ T cells, can interrupt antitumor immune reactions by interacting with various other immune cells.
The present study aimed to determine the expression level of Treg cells in myeloma compared with that in normal control.
