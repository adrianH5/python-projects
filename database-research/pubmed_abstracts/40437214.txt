Natural killer (NK) cells are among the first immune cell populations to recover after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCTâ€‰), yet their dynamic function in pediatric patients remains understudied.
Investigating NK cell recovery could improve understanding of post-autoHSCT immune reconstitution and optimize clinical outcomes.
