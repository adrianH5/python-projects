Recent evidences show that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays an essential role in physiology and pathophysiology.
The purpose of this study was to determine the role and its potential underlying mechanisms of the lncRNA transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology pseudogene 1 (TPTEP1) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
