A thickened Achilles tendon (AT) is one of the important morphological changes observed in Achilles tendinopathy (ATTP).
Previous research studies have demonstrated that both Achilles tendon thickness (ATT) and Achilles tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) (ATCSA) are correlated with ATTP in subjects.
However, the comparative value of ATT and ATCSA in relation to ATTP is not clear, and no studies have calculated the optimal clinical threshold values of ATT and ATCSA.
The goal of this research was to assess ATT and ATCSA and determine which parameter is more sensitive in predicting ATTP.
