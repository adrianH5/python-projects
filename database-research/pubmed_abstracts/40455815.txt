There is an ongoing need for efficacious, life-prolonging therapies for males with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
mCRPC that progresses after treatment with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) may still be driven by AR signaling.
BMS-986365 is a heterobifunctional, orally bioavailable ligand-directed degrader that targets the AR through a first-in-class dual mechanism of AR degradation and antagonism.
Here, we present the study design of rechARge, a phase III, randomized, multicenter, adaptive, two-part, open-label trial evaluating BMS-986365 versus investigator's choice of therapy comprising either docetaxel or a switch to an alternative ARPI (abiraterone or enzalutamide) in patients with mCRPC whose disease has progressed after treatment with one prior ARPI.
The primary study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of BMS-986365 versus investigator's choice of therapy.
Approximately 960 patients will be enrolled.
