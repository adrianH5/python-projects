Diabetic wounds (DW) are one of the complications of diabetes.
They are difficult to repair and current treatment options are limited.
In this study, we employed a network pharmacology approach to investigate the therapeutic potential of Apigenin (API) in the treatment of DW.
We used TCMSP, ETCM and SwissTargetPrediction to identify API's drug targets and DisGeNET, GeneCards, TTD, and OMIN for DW-related targets, yielding a set of intersecting genes.
Then, we constructed the PPI network by STRING and visualized with Cytoscape software.
Further refinement through relevant algorithms of Cytohubba identified nine core genes: HSP90AA1, ACTB, AKT1, BCL2, EGFR, SRC, CCND1, ESR1, and JUN.
GO/KEGG analysis were conducted using the DAVID database.
The results show that the targets are enriched in biological processes related to cell and smooth muscle movement and migration, as well as pathways associated with anti-inflammatory, diabetes, and inflammatory stimuli.
Moreover, the binding affinity of API to identified core targets was confirmed through molecular docking using Autodock software.
We further carried out Molecular docking simulations to verify that API exhibits significant binding affinities towards these core targets, suggesting a robust interaction profile.
Finally, the experimental validation further confirmed the regulatory effect of API on PI3K-AKT signaling and cell apoptotic pathway.
Our research elucidated that API holds significant promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of DWs.
