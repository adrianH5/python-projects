The choroid plexus (ChP) regulates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, providing essential molecular cues for brain development; yet, embryonic ChP secretory mechanisms remain poorly defined.
Here we identify apocrine secretion by embryonic ChP epithelial cells as a key regulator of the CSF proteome and neurodevelopment in male and female mice.
We demonstrate that the activation of serotonergic 5-HT
