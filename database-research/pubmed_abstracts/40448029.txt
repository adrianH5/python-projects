Differentiated Thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy.
The identification of novel biomarkers for thyroid carcinoma is essential for enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DTC development.
Notably, gut microorganisms and their metabolites play a role in the development of DTC, although their influence is modulated by the host's genetic background and environmental factors.
Our study aimed to identify and classify gut microbiota and metabolites associated with DTC.
