Extracellular matrix (ECM), a core member of tumor microenvironment, is â‰ˆ1.5-fold harder than the surrounding normal tissues.
Regulating the stiffness of ECM can significantly impact physiological activities of tumor cells, such as growth, differentiation, and migration.
Herein, a sonopiezoelectric-response nanoplatform consisting of Cu
