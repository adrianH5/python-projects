Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-established primary etiological factor involved in cervical cancer oncogenesis.
Recent research has also identified HPV as a significant contributor to head and neck cancers, including oral cancer.
This study aimed to investigate the influence of high-risk cervical HPV infection on oral carcinogenesis.
