Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignant tumor type all over the world with high mortality.
Chemoresistance of CRC leads to treatment failure and disease aggravation.
We previously identified Hsa_circ_0020095 as a novel oncogene to promote progression and cisplatin-resistance in colon cancers by modulating the miR-487a-3p/SOX9 axis.
