Head and neck cancer (HNSCC) rank as the sixth most prevalent malignancy globally.
Despite advancements in current anti-HNSCC therapeutic strategies, including the combination of systemic chemotherapy and radiation (RT), survival rates have plateaued.
In patients with comorbidities or recurrent/metastatic disease, these treatments may cause significant adverse effects and reduced survival rates, highlighting the need for the development of novel strategies that yield durable responses.
Moreover, several oral and systemic problems are linked to the combination of radiation and systemic chemotherapy.
We present a novel therapy that integrates radiation and cisplatin within a gel-like ester-anhydride biodegradable polymer (PSARA), facilitating sustained local release of cisplatin.
This agent is administered intratumorally, facilitating prolonged and constant administration of cisplatin to the tumor tissue.
The integration of radiotherapy with confined intratumoral administration of cisplatin is less harmful and more efficacious in inhibiting tumor-related subpopulations inside the tumor and tumor proliferation.
The proposed therapy can be immediately implemented for tumors in the head and neck, as well as for other cancer types.
