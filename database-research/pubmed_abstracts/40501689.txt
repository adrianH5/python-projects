Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family signaling is commonly dysregulated in cancer by amplification or activating mutations.
We investigated the incidence of EGFR amplification with or without PI3Kinase pathway mutations in breast cancer and whether patients with genetic abnormalities in both pathways can be targeted by dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition.
