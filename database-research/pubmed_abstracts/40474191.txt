Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) associated with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) constitutes a clinicopathologically distinct entity in context to younger age of presentation, better histological grade of tumor differentiation, and lower risk of nodal metastasis.
This study is intended to provide the basis of clinical presentation of OSCC associated with OSMF to consider a clinicopathologically unique entity compared to OSCC without OSMF.
