People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including prolonged viral shedding and emergence of mutations.
To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 in all macaques was mild.
SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection.
Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells.
Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract.
Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract.
This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH.
We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution.
This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.
