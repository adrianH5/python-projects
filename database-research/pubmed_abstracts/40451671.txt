Preoperative diagnosis of follicular thyroid neoplasm (FTN) (including follicular thyroid adenoma [FTA] and follicular thyroid carcinoma [FTC]) is difficult and the current ultrasound risk stratification systems (RSSs) for thyroid nodules are not suitable for FTN.
Therefore, this study aimed to establish a new RSS for FTN as a useful preoperative evaluation to reduce missed diagnoses and unnecessary biopsies.
