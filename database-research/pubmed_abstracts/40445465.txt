Head and neck cancer (HNC) encompasses a diverse array of malignancies impacting the anatomical structures of the head and neck region, ranking as the seventh most prevalent cancer type globally.
The occurrence and advancement of HNC are intricately linked to mutations and disruptions within critical signaling pathways, accentuating the imperative for targeted therapeutic interventions to rectify these genetic aberrations.
Traditional treatment modalities, including surgical intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, frequently culminate in considerable morbidity and suboptimal prognoses.
Recently, the CRISPR-Cas system has emerged as a revolutionary gene-editing platform, poised to redefine therapeutic approaches in gene therapy and oncological research.
Despite its potential, CRISPR-Cas faces challenges such as off-target effects, delivery inefficiencies, and immunogenicity, which must be addressed for clinical success.
This review meticulously evaluates the progress in CRISPR-Cas technologies aimed at targeting essential signaling pathways implicated in HNC, addressing current challenges while highlighting optimal targets, Cas nucleases, and innovative delivery mechanisms, thereby elucidating the therapeutic potential and clinical applicability of the CRISPR-Cas paradigm in the management of HNC.
