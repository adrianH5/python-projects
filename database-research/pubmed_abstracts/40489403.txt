Metabolically regulated Akt activation is a critical node in the insulin signaling cascade and provides valuable insights into the relationship between diabetes and cancer.
To precisely quantify Akt activity in HepG2 cells, we developed a robust, reproducible protocol utilizing FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) with genetically encoded Akt-specific biosensors.
This protocol outlines detailed steps for cell culture, imaging dish preparation, and transfection of HepG2 cells to express FRET-based biosensors, alongside specific guidelines for laser scanning confocal microscope hardware and software configuration.
The results demonstrated unique patterns of insulin signaling in HepG2 cells, which exhibit an irreversible switch characterized by constitutive Akt activation with a defined switch-on threshold but no switch-off threshold.
In contrast, myotubes display a reversible switch.
The persistent Akt activation in HepG2 cells suggests mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation in hepatic cells, with broader implications for understanding the progression of metabolic disorders and cancer.
This protocol offers a valuable framework for exploring Akt-related signaling pathways and cellular behaviors across various disease contexts.
