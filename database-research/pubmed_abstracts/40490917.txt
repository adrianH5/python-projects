Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, often presenting diagnostic challenges in patients with underlying liver cirrhosis (CIRR).
In this study, we employed both untargeted and targeted analysis of low-abundance serum proteins to identify potential biomarkers for HCC.
In the untargeted study, we identified 15 proteins that exhibited statistically significant differential expression in HCC vs CIRR.
In the targeted study, we confirmed differential expression of retinol-binding protein 4 (
