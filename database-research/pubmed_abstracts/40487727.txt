Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) has demonstrated promising treatment outcomes for pancreatic cancer.
However, breathing-induced organ motion can compromise the efficacy of the treatment, leading to under- or over-dosage within the target and organs at risk (OARs).
In this work, the dose during CIRT was simultaneously measured at the target and OARs using an anthropomorphic phantom to evaluate the effectiveness of respiratory gating for compensating breathing motion.
