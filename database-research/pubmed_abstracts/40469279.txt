Combination strategies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been a prominent focus of research in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Our prior findings demonstrated that the combination of autologous NK cells with the PD-1 antibody (Sintilimab), offered promising efficacy in NSCLC patients who failed the first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
Here, we present updated overall survival (OS) data from the final analysis, aiming to identify patient subgroups that derive maximal benefit from this therapeutic approach.
