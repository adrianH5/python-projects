Extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly small EVs (sEVs), are lipid bilayer vesicles secreted by various cell types and play a key role in intercellular communication.
These vesicles are promising tools for cancer immunotherapy owing to their biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and capacity for targeted drug delivery.
In this study, we aimed to assess the potential of engineered antigen-presenting EVs (AP-EVs) to selectively expand and differentiate antigen-specific CD4
