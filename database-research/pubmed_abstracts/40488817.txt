Lynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited cancer predisposition caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes.
Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is the third most common cancer associated with LS.
In this study, we examined MMR protein expression in UTUC using immunohistochemistry to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic significance of LS-associated UTUC.
