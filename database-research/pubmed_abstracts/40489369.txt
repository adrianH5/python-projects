Breast cancer screening enables the use of earlier treatment options and contributes to decreased mortality, however, there are urban-rural screening differences that impact the survival of rural women.
Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), rural-residing women veterans are 1 of the fastest growing groups to enroll in health care, but little is known about their access factors specific to screening mammography.
The objective of this study was to examine mammography access factors among VA-enrolled rural women veterans overdue for breast cancer screening.
