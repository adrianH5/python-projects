mRNA translation is rapidly upregulated after injury to supply proteins required for tissue regeneration.
Augmented protein synthesis during regeneration has long been associated with increases in ribosome biogenesis and mTORC1 activity.
Emerging evidence highlights the roles of multiple signaling pathways, RNA-binding proteins, and RNA modifications in tissue repair.
Here, we review recent research on the molecular mechanisms underlying translational control in response to tissue damage.
The findings underscore the importance of mRNA translation in regeneration and its potential therapeutic applications in tissue repair.
