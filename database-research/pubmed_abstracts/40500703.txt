The current treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.
Although many patients respond well to this treatment, many will relapse and die from peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Adding Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) to the standard treatment has been shown to improve survival by reducing cancer recurrence in the abdomen, with acceptable side effects.
This article summarizes the current evidence and our long experience with CRS and HIPEC at different stages of ovarian cancer treatment: at upfront CRS, at interval CRS, at secondary CRS, and as palliative setting.
