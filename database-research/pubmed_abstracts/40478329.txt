Improving cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) before and after colorectal cancer surgery may improve postoperative outcomes.
This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of perioperative exercise therapy (aerobic, resistance, mind-body, flexibility, or mixed exercise (combined aerobic and resistance)) on CRF, the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT), postoperative complications, and adverse events for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery.
