Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the lethal form of malignant change involving the pancreas.
The median age of diagnosis is 71 years and is uncommon below 40 years.
Here we intend to report an uncommon case of a 25-year-old woman who presented to our institution with complaints of fever, severe abdominal pain.
The laboratory workup showed bicytopenia with USG abdomen revealing a bulky pancreas.
The Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography suggested malignancy followed by Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) which confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the 14th most common cancer and 7th most common cause of cancer death.
Computed tomography is most useful modality of investigation used to diagnose and stage the cancer.
This is supported by FNAC and CA19-9 tumor marker.
The management includes surgical resection and chemotherapy.
Although pancreatic adenocarcinoma is uncommon among the young population, it requires early management protocols.
