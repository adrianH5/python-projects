Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) is a highly malignant bile duct cancer with a poor prognosis and rising incidence.
Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a crucial role in cancer biology, influencing tumor immunity and treatment response.
This study analyzes the impact of multiple PCD patterns on CHOL prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) and drug sensitivity.
