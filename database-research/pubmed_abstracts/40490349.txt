Glioblastoma is a rapidly growing form of brain tumour originating from the supportive tissues present in the brain or spinal cord.
The conventional therapeutic options include the use of alkylating agents, radiation and surgical procedures, that exhibits numerous limitations.
The considerably less survival rate, very high incidence of recurrence and lack of effective therapeutic options has made the disease as the most lethal brain cancer.
Being widely investigated, nanocarriers assure efficacy in brain targeting.
Nano-based systems also hold the edge of higher encapsulation efficiency, ability to encapsulate anticancer therapeutics and effective blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration ability has been proven as one of the most successful means of delivering therapeutic agents in brain interstitial.
The extreme biocompatible and biodegradable features of chitosan (CS) have been advantageous in combination with its easy fabrication and modifiable physicochemical behaviour.
CS has been extensively investigated in the synthesis of nano-systems for brain targeting of drugs.
The mucoadhesive behaviour of CS, cationic nature, and its ability to conjugate with various ligands helps in effective targeting of glioblastoma.
This review specifically focuses on the fabrication of various CS-based nanocarriers for glioblastoma therapy, alongside describing its suitability and reflecting the recent research outcomes in glioblastoma therapy.
