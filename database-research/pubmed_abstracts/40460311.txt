Cancer is an extremely diverse and unpredictable disease on multiple levels.
To find novel compounds with anticancer therapeutic potential, we designed and synthesised a library of triazene-appended morpholine chalcones and screened their activity against breast, lung and colorectal cancer cell lines.
(E)-1-{4-[(E)-morpholinodiazenyl]phenyl}-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (Compound 22) displayed notable cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and colon cancer cells (SW480), with IC
