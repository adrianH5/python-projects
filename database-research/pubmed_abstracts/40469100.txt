Glioma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (GA-MSCs), as a critical component of the glioma microenvironment, play an essential role in the development and invasion of glioma.
Recent studies have shown that GA-MSCs can differentiate into pericytes under certain conditions, thereby promoting angiogenesis.
However, the biological properties and molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood.
In the glioma microenvironment, our data revealed that the upregulation of Phosducin-like 3 (
