The lack of a definitive cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is fueling the search for innovative therapeutic strategies.
Having revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, immune cell engineering with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) is being explored to target AD.
Whether CARs can recognize distinct amyloid-β (Aβ) species and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)-hallmark pathologies of AD-remains unclear.
