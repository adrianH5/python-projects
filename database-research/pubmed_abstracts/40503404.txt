Multiple primary carcinoma (MPC) refers to two or more types of primary malignant tumors occurring simultaneously or sequentially in the same patient.
Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors affecting women.
On the other hand, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
In clinical practice, the simultaneous existence of metachronous primary breast cancer and lymphoma is rare.
In this case, we highlight the significance of multidisciplinary management and advanced imaging techniques in the early identification and treatment of MPC cases.
