The management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-derived pancreatic cancer is extrapolated from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PanIN)-derived pancreatic cancer.
However, these cancers are biologically and clinically distinct and evidence regarding the role of adjuvant therapy (AT) is unclear.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to consolidate current evidence regarding survival benefit of AT for IPMN-derived pancreatic cancer.
