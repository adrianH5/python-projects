Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at increased risk of developing cancer, with the most common sites being colorectal, duodenal/ampullary and thyroid.
In the last decade, an alarming increase in gastric cancer has been reported in the Western FAP population.
These cancers are often diagnosed at an advanced stage with poor prognosis, even in patients undergoing regular upper endoscopic surveillance.
Most gastric cancers in Western patients with FAP occur in the proximal stomach, where a carpeting of fundic gland polyposis hampers visualization of gastric cancer and its precursor lesions during endoscopic surveillance.
Although fundic gland polyps are the most prevalent proximal polyp, several different dysplastic lesions can be found in the stomachs of patients with FAP.
including fundic gland polyps with dysplasia, foveolar-type adenomas, pyloric gland adenomas, and intestinal-type adenomas.
Although adenomas are the most likely precursors to gastric cancer, the exact lesions responsible for gastric cancer in FAP are not yet fully understood.
This review focuses on gastric polyposis and the characteristics of gastric cancer in Western patients with FAP, including risk factors, lesion detection, surveillance and management of gastric polyposis, and areas for future research.
