Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases.
Lactylation, a lactate-driven post-translational modification, has been implicated in various tumor pathologies.
This study aimed to investigate the role of histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) in NSCLC progression.
Western blot was performed to detect the protein levels of lactylation and H3K18la.
Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and Transwell migration assays were performed to detect the cell viability, proliferation, and migration.
The 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (
