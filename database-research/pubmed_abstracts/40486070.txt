Over 9000 patients are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer annually in the United Kingdom (UK).
Decision-making about treatment options is influenced by radiological staging, which may include computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).
The use of EUS varies considerably around the UK and, since the introduction of PET-CT, the added value of EUS has been questioned.
The VALUE study aims to understand this variation and determine how often and why EUS changes treatment decisions.
VALUE will also evaluate patient and clinician experiences and opinions of EUS.
