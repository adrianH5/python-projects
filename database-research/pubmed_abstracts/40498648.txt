Imatinib treatment is approved for several indications, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).
Although adverse events are common, hypersensitivity reactions are not.
Because there is a clear clinical benefit of imatinib treatment, re-introduction of imatinib after a hypersensitivity reaction should be considered.
