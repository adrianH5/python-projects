Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a standard treatment strategy for breast cancer, with a commonly used regimen consisting of 4-cycle anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) treatment followed sequentially by 4-cycle taxane (T) treatment.
Variations in treatment efficacy are observed at different stages of AC-T regimen.
Stratifying patients based on the efficacy variations could provide insights to prolong the cycle of AC or T treatment, potentially enhancing the overall efficacy of NAC.
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of developing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic models for predicting the relative efficacy of AC versus T treatments.
