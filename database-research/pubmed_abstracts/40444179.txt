Vitamins are vital nutrients essential for metabolism, functioning as coenzymes, antioxidants, and regulators of gene expression.
Their absorption and metabolism rely on specialized transport proteins that ensure bioavailability and cellular utilization.
Water-soluble vitamins, including B-complex and vitamin C, are transported by solute carrier (SLC) family proteins and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for efficient uptake and cellular distribution.
Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) rely on lipid-mediated pathways through proteins like scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), CD36, and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), integrating their absorption with lipid metabolism.
Defective vitamin transporters are associated with diverse metabolic disorders, including neurological, hematological, and mitochondrial diseases.
Advances in structural and functional studies of vitamin transporters highlight their tissue-specific roles and regulatory mechanisms, shedding light on their impact on health and disease.
This review emphasizes the significance of vitamin transporters and their potential as therapeutic targets for deficiencies and related chronic conditions.
