As a part of the innate immune system, eosinophils are recruited during infectious diseases, to release their characteristic cytotoxic granules and catch pathogens in extracellular traps.
Moreover, eosinophils have a crucial role in autoimmune diseases, for example allergies.
The isolation of these densest and lowest abundant leukocytes is cost-and labor intense.
This sets restrictions on many aspects of eosinophilic research.
In this study, we performed a thorough characterization and functional assessment of the HL-60 clone 15 (HC15) cell line, which can be differentiated into eosinophil-like cells, to investigate its potential in eosinophil research.
