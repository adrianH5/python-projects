Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have revolutionized the treatment of homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) tumors, yet their efficacy in homologous recombination-proficient (HRP) tumors is still limited.
Here, we pinpoint lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) as a key epigenetic regulator driving PARPi resistance.
Our study demonstrate that elevated LOXL2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and disease recurrence in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients.
Functional studies reveal that LOXL2 depletion or pharmacological inhibition synergizes with PARPi to suppress HRP models of both ovarian and breast cancer.
Mechanistically, LOXL2 directly interacts with and transcriptionally activates BRD4, a core component of the super-enhancer complex, thereby amplifying the expression of DNA damage repair (DDR) genes such as MDC1, KAT5, and USP7.
Strikingly, LOXL2 inhibition induces a "BRCAness" phenotype in HRP tumors, rendering them more susceptible to PARPi by impairing DDR capacity.
Combining BET inhibitors with PARPi abrogates LOXL2-mediated resistance, underscoring BRD4 dependency in this process.
Our findings establish LOXL2 as a druggable epigenetic target to overcome PARPi resistance in HRP models of multiple tumor types, presenting a therapeutic strategy independent of HR status and holding significant clinical potential for expanding PARPi benefits to a broader patient population.
