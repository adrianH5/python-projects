Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) cell therapy represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment, offering remarkable responses in certain hematologic malignancies.
However, the risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) associated with CAR-T therapy is a growing concern.
Recent studies suggest that antibiotics, which are frequently used in CAR-T patients, may influence this risk, yet their effects remain poorly understood.
