Eosinophils, which are multifunctional leukocytes, play pivotal roles in tissue repair, immune responses against pathogens, and the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neoplasms and inflammatory conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.
Despite advancements in understanding eosinophil biology and recruitment, the specific roles of eosinophil granule proteins in eosinophil-associated autoimmune diseases remain incompletely understood.
