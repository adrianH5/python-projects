Due to potential for local regrowth in patients undergoing nonoperative management (NOM) of rectal adenocarcinoma, current guidelines recommend offering close surveillance in a "watch-and-wait" paradigm.
These regimens require many visits, potentially posing significant burden on patients.
There is a paucity of data regarding optimal frequency of examinations.
We sought to determine adherence to recommended surveillance, identify predictors of poor adherence, and evaluate its association with on oncologic outcomes during the first 2 y after clinical complete response (cCR).
