The Global Strategy for the Elimination of Cervical Cancer as a Public Health Problem proposed a goal of 90% coverage for HPV vaccination in girls between 9 and 14Â years of age by 2030.

The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed description of the creation of a protocol for an intervention to increase HPV vaccine uptake among vaccine-eligible children and adolescents in a school setting.
