Frailty assessment is fundamental to geriatric oncology (GO), with GO guidelines endorsing Geriatric-8 (G8) as a frailty screening tool.
Although the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is widely used in geriatrics, no studies have examined its quality of life (QoL) utility in GO.
We compare CFS and G8 in their ability to predict quality of life among older adults receiving curative cancer treatment.
