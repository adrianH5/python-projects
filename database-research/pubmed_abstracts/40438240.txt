Like all aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, teleost fish are subject to the constant pressure of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms present in the environmental interface that can potentially cause disease.
Numerous defense molecules, including galectins, have been isolated from the skin and gut tissues of several marine and freshwater fish species.
To provide new insights into the potential role(s) of galectins in the teleost fish innate immune system, we carried out studies on the striped bass (
