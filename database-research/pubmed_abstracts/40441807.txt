PGDM1400LS is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the HIV envelope V2 apex with a lysine-serine modification intended to enhance serum and tissue half-lives and is being considered for use in combination monoclonal antibody trials.
We sought to test whether PGDM1400LS was safe and had favourable serum concentration, pharmacokinetics, and neutralising ability in healthy adults.
