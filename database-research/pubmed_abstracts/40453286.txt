The global impact of oral cavity cancer (OCC) is substantial, given its five-year survival rate of nearly 50%.
Tobacco, alcohol, and betel nut consumption are primary risk factors, but OCC can also develop in individuals without these exposures.
Recent studies increasingly indicate that the oral microbiome may contribute to the pathogenesis of OCC, especially in the context of poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease.
The oral microbiome consists of hundreds of bacterial and fungal species, influenced by factors such as smoking, alcohol, diet, and medications.
Smoking disrupts microbial balance and epithelial barriers, contributing to dysbiosis.
Studies have linked periodontal pathogens like
