Cervical cancer, primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), is a major health concern worldwide, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan.
A total of 212 women participated in the study, with 68.4% from Pakistan and 31.6% from Afghanistan.
The majority of participants (80.7%) were from urban areas, and the most common age group was 31 to 50 years (46.2%), 60.8% being illiterate, 77.3% were non-working and 92% were married.
The study found that both Pakistani and Afghan participants had similar, non-significant knowledge regarding cervical cancer and HPV, with Pakistani participants showing slightly higher awareness.
Education played a crucial role in knowledge levels; Pakistani women, particularly those with higher education, were more informed about the prevention and early treatment of cervical cancer.
However, knowledge about HPV vaccines was low across both groups, with Pakistani women being more aware than Afghan women.
In terms of willingness to vaccinate children and pay for vaccines, Pakistani participants showed greater enthusiasm compared to Afghan participants, although the differences were non-significant.
Logistic regression analysis showed that education, urban background and employment status were significantly linked to knowledge about cervical cancer, HPV and its vaccine.
Women with higher education and urban backgrounds had better knowledge and were more willing to pay for the vaccine.
In conclusion, this study highlights the influence of socio-demographic factors, such as education, urban background and employment status, on women's knowledge about cervical cancer, HPV and its vaccine.
Although both Pakistani and Afghan participants demonstrated similar levels of awareness, Pakistani women, especially those with higher education, were more knowledgeable about prevention and early treatment options.
Despite limited awareness about HPV vaccines, Pakistani participants exhibited more willingness to vaccinate their children and pay for the vaccine compared to Afghan participants.
These findings underscore the importance of education and urbanisation in improving health knowledge and vaccine uptake.
