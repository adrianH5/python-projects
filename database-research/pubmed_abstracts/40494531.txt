Given the high prevalence of colorectal cancer and the substantial side effects of chemotherapy, enhancing patient self-management is of paramount importance.
This study aims to identify factors influencing self-management positivity in colorectal cancer chemotherapy patients.
It also examines the mediating role of self-regulatory fatigue in the relationship between health empowerment and self-management positivity.
A total of 302 CRC chemotherapy patients were selected from three hospitals in China.
Data were collected using a general information questionnaire, the Cancer Empowerment Questionnaire, the Self-Regulatory Fatigue Scale, and the Patient Activation Measure.
The results indicate that age, primary payment source, residence, self-regulatory fatigue, and health empowerment were identified as independent predictors of self-management positivity.
Self-regulatory fatigue partially mediated the relationship between health empowerment and self-management motivation, with a mediation effect of 0.120 (95% CI [0.070 ~ 0.178]), accounting for 18.94% of the total effect.
In the future, healthcare professionals should pay more attention to patients' self-regulatory fatigue and health empowerment capabilities.
By implementing approaches including motivational interviewing and health education seminars, to boost patients' self-management positivity, encourage effective self-management behaviors, and enhance therapeutic efficacy.
