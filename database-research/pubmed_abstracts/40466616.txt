Niclosamide (NIC) has anti-tumor activity and less side effects on the body, but its instability and solubility limit its wide application.
Niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NES), a derivative of niclosamide, exhibits better solubility than niclosamide, but the anti-tumor activity and solubility are not still ideal.
In this study, Niclosamide ethanolamine salt-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (NHC) was formed by using Niclosamide ethanolamine salt as the raw material and containing it in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin to improve the solubility and bioavailability of NES.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the NHC showed that the NHC was successfully prepared.
The therapeutic effects of NES and NHC on colon cancer were compared by in vivo experiments.
The results showed that, the NHC is apotentially effective treatment for colon cancer compared to NES.
In addition, combining metabolomics with 16S rRNA technology preliminarily investigated the mechanism of NHC in the treatment of colon cancer.
