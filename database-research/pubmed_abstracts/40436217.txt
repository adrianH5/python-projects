Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are a class of signal transduction adapter proteins characterized by a common structural domain at their C-terminus.
Compared with seven family members (TRAF1-7) in mammals, TRAFs mediate innate and adaptive immune responses, regulate multiple signaling pathways, and are extensively involved in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.
TRAFs play crucial roles in inflammatory responses and the development and progression of human cancers.
In recent years, an increasing body of research has revealed that the interactions between the TRAF family and viruses are complex and varied, profoundly influencing the ultimate outcomes of viral infections.
This study aims to elucidate the structure and function of the TRAF family comprehensively and to explore the roles and mechanisms of TRAFs in different viral infections, offering new perspectives and potential therapeutic targets for antiviral treatment.
