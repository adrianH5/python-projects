Only a few bladder cancer patients benefit from anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 immunotherapy.
The cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) plays an important role in tumor immune evasion.
CD47 is a highly glycosylated protein, however, the mechanisms governing CD47 glycosylation and its potential role in immunosuppression are unclear.
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the function of CD47 glycosylation in bladder cancer.
