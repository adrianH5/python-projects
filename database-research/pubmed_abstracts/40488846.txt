The incidence of malignant tumors continues to grow.
Still, with the rapid development of various diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, the survival rate of malignant tumors has been improved, and the increased survival rate has introduced the need for fertility preservation therapy for cancer patients.
Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is a relatively new technique that has gained milestones, but because ovarian tissue transplantation is a non-vascular anastomotic free graft, the growth and development of the transplanted ovarian tissue is contingent on the re-establishment of the circulatory system.
More than 50% of follicles are lost before neovascularization of the tissue is established after transplantation.
In this systematic evaluation, we searched Embase and PubMed databases and included reports of trials using mouse or human ovarian tissue for transplantation in combination with growth factors.
Of the 812 articles retrieved, 9 met the criteria.
The growth factor applied to transplant ovarian tissue promotes the process of vascular reconstruction, thus enhancing the preservation of follicle and ovarian tissue.
The conclusion that growth factors promote the recovery of transplanted ovarian tissue can be drawn from histological analyses of ovarian tissue, the detection of factors responsible for blood vessel formation, and the study of sex hormone levels that indirectly indicate the recovery of ovarian function.
