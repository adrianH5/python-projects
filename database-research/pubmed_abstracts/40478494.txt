Salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is a morphologically challenging tumor, harboring a canonical CRTC1/3:MAML2 fusion, if investigated.
However, the large cohorts available did not invesitgate the diagnosed cases adequately; leaving any mucin-producingÂ malignancy possible MECs although >50% of salivary gland tumors secret mucin luminally or extra-luminally.
This study examined the expression of stem cell markers Nanog, SOX2, OCT4, and MENA in salivary MEC using immunohistochemistry and to confer, whether or not, they may have a potential role in defining the tumoral molecular profile.
