Mutations in glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) are associated with oncogenesis, but the opposing roles of GSK3 in tumour suppression and promotion, inadequate methods for assessing GSK3 activity and off-target effects of commonly used inhibitors on cell proliferation have stalled progress to clinical benefit.
This review evaluates evidence linking GSK3 dysfunction to specific cancer types and explores how this knowledge could help develop clinical applications.
Very few, if any, of the published studies on GSK3 and oncogenesis demonstrate significant alteration in GSK3 activity associated with malignancy.
Unfortunately, identifying GSK3 mutations or quantifying expression levels offers limited insights into functional activity and this underpins the lack of progress towards clinical use.
Developing precise, user-friendly biomarkers of GSK3 activity would allow researchers and clinicians to accurately assess its role in cancer progression and drug resistance, helping to overcome barriers to effective GSK3-targeted therapies.
