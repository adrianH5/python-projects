The incidence of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) is increasing.
To improve patient outcomes, it is essential to develop integrated treatment strategies based on tumor characteristics.
Researchers need a rapid visualization of global research trends in GEP-NETs.
However, there is currently no bibliometric analysis of GEP-NETs available.
This paper aims to fill this gap by using bibliometric methods to quantitatively visualize the current status and research hotspots of GEP-NETs from 2000 to 2023, thereby providing a reference for future research.
