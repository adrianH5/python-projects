Patients treated with proton beam therapy (PBT) undergo routine verification CT (VCT) scans during their courses of treatment to evaluate anatomic variations and the potential need for revision planning.
Dosimetrists evaluate each VCT plan with physicians, which can be logistically challenging and present a bottleneck in the clinical workflow.
In this study, a standardized head-and-neck verification plan review protocol was established based on physician consensus to streamline the review process.
A physicist used these criteria to evaluate each VCT plan, flagging cases that did not meet the criteria for review by the attending physician.
Results are presented for 321 VCT scans for 164 patients.
During the testing period, the consensus criteria correctly flagged 95% of cases deemed to require adaptive replans by physicians.
Further, 49% of direct review cases were eliminated after clinical implementation.
