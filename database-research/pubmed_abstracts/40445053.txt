Based on eight clinical cases the article analyzes the main clinical and radiographic features of eight children aged 6-14 years with rare cystic lesions: juvenile inflammatory collateral cyst (ICC).
ICCs were associated with incompletely erupted first (6 children) or second (2 children) permanent molars.
Only in 5 cases did they manifest as pain in the area of the affected teeth, in the remaining cases they were radiographic findings during examination before orthodontic treatment.
At the same time, the teeth in the projection of the cyst retained their vitality in all cases, which was confirmed by the cold test and continued root growth after cystectomy.
On OPG, ICCs were manifested by a wide variety of localizations (in the bifurcation projection, below, distal or medial to the roots of the teeth), but CBCT made it possible to detect a common symptom - predominantly the vestibular location of the lesion.
Cystectomy without endodontic treatment of teeth in the projection of the cyst turned out to be a successful treatment tactic, which is confirmed by observation for 6 -84 months without recurrence of ICCs and dental complications.
