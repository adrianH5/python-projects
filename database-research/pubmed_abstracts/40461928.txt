Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound derived from cannabis, has gained significant attention for its potential therapeutic effects across various types of cancer.
This manuscript presents a systematic review of the current evidence on the application of CBD in gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, with a focus on gastric and colorectal cancers.
The review aims to explore CBD's mechanisms of action, including its effects on apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and its potential to enhance the efficacy of conventional therapies.
Furthermore, it examines the challenges involved in translating preclinical findings into clinical settings, such as issues related to bioavailability and regulatory hurdles.
The review also addresses future directions for the use of CBD in combination therapies and its potential to overcome resistance mechanisms in GI cancers.
By analyzing the molecular pathways modulated by CBD, this manuscript seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of its therapeutic potential, contributing to the future of GI cancer treatment.
