Turner syndrome (TS) is the most common genetic cause of premature (primary) ovarian insufficiency (POI).
Human fetal 45,X ovaries demonstrate marked apoptosis by 15 to 20 weeks post conception (wpc), likely partly driven by X-chromosome haploinsufficiency.
However, the genomic drivers of ovarian insufficiency in TS remain largely unexplored.
