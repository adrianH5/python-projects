Tumor imaging or therapy using cancer specific carriers combined with a radioisotope has huge potential.
In radiopharmaceutical development, it is important to ensure target specificity and minimal binding to normal tissues for both tumor detection and treatment.
In previous studies, we identified CAPRIN-1 as a cancer-specific antigen, which is widely expressed on the cell surface membrane in many types of solid cancers, and created TRK-950, a humanized monoclonal antibody raised against CAPRIN-1, followed by conducting clinical development.
In this proof-of-concept study, we prepared radiolabeled form of TRK-950 and investigated their potential as tumor imaging or therapeutic agents.
