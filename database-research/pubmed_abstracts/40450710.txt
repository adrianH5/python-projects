pH-responsive charge-convertible nanomaterials (NMs) ameliorate the treatment of cancer via simultaneously reducing nonspecific interactions during systemic circulation and improving targeted uptake within solid tumors.
While promising, little is known about how the pH-responsiveness of charge-convertible NMs directs their interactions with biological systems, leading to compromised performance, including off-target retention and low specificity to tumor cells.
In the present study, polyglycerol-grafted graphene oxide bearing amino groups (GOPGNH
