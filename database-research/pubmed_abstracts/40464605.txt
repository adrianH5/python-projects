Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most aggressive tumors requiring new therapeutic approaches.
Immunotherapy represents an opportunity, but to date, OC patients do not appear to benefit from current protocols.
A better understanding of the composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME), especially in its immune components, could unveil mechanisms of immune suppression in a useful way to predict response to therapies and develop new therapeutic approaches.
