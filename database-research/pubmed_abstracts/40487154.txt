Open pin-site wounds, with infection rates of 11 %-100 %, pose significant clinical challenges, affecting millions globally and often leading to life-threatening complications.
Current dressings fail to simultaneously block bacterial invasion and manage internal wound infection, necessitating innovative solutions.
This study introduces PINSHIELD, a dual-functional dressing that externally seals wounds while efficiently managing exudate to mitigate pin-site infections (PSI).
The external shell provides a physical barrier, while the embedded zinc alginate-polyurethane (ZAPU) layer combines active antibacterial properties with passive bacterial adhesion.
The optimized ZAPU structure absorbs exudate and regulates the wound microenvironment, inhibiting bacterial proliferation and limiting infection spread.
