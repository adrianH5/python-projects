Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological cancer.
Resveratrol, a natural plant polyphenol, has demonstrated antitumor efficacy in various human cancers.
Despite its recognized potential, the specific impact of resveratrol on RCC remains unclear.
This study aimed to ascertain the potential of resveratrol in suppressing RCC progression and to elucidate the intricate molecular mechanisms governing its effects.
The CCK8 assay outcomes indicate that resveratrol inhibits RCC cell viability in a dose-dependent manner.
Transwell and wound healing assays confirmed the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on RCC cell invasion and migration.
Flow cytometry further demonstrated that resveratrol induced apoptosis in RCC cells.
Additionally, in vivo experiments have established the ability of resveratrol to impede RCC tumor growth.
Mechanistically, resveratrol exhibits its inhibitory influence on RCC cells by downregulating PRDX4 expression, consequently weakening the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
These findings gain support from experiments utilizing a Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator.
In summary, our results suggest that resveratrol impedes the progression of RCC by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via the downregulation of PRDX4.PRDX4.
