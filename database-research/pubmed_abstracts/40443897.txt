Glycopeptides derived from the mucin-1 (MUC1) glycoprotein hold significant promise as cancer vaccine candidates, but their clinical utility is limited by proteolytic degradation and the poor bioavailability of L-α-amino acid-based peptides.
In this study, we demonstrate that substitution of multiple α-amino acids with homologous β-amino acids (same side chain, but extended backbone) in
