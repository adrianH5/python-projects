Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary disorder caused by constitutional pathogenic variants in the APC gene, leading to the development of up to hundreds of colorectal adenomas and a near-inevitable risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) if untreated.
Traditional management relies on prophylactic colectomy, but advances in endoscopic techniques and chemoprevention offer alternative strategies to delay or even avoid surgery.
This review explores the role of endoscopic surveillance, polypectomy strategies, and chemopreventive agents in FAP management, evaluating their efficacy, limitations, and the need for personalized approaches.
