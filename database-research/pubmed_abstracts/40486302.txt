Thyroid carcinomas comprise diverse subtypes, each characterized by distinct histomorphologies, molecular profiles, and prognoses.
Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a differentiated thyroid cancer demonstrating vascular and/or capsular invasion, while anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is an aggressive and undifferentiated form with an exceedingly dismal prognosis.
Thyroid carcinomas also can exhibit mixed histologic features, complicating the diagnosis and management of these entities.
