The biology of metastatic breast cancer is poorly understood, and its understanding is hampered by limited access to metastatic tissue.
Post-mortem tissue donation programs may represent a step forward to circumvent this problem, allowing access to large volumes of samples that would often be inaccessible otherwise.
In this context, we have set up the UZ/KU Leuven Post-mortem Tissue Donation Program to Enhance Research (UPTIDER, NCT04531696).
In this study, we performed detailed histopathological examination of 662 unique metastases collected during autopsy from the first 20 patients in our UPTIDER program.
Tissue procurement was guided by a patient-specific tissue donation plan based on available clinical and imaging data.
Central pathology review included revision of the primary tumor and biomarker assessment (ER, PR, HER2 and KI67).
Linear mixed quantile regression was used to assess relevant associations.
Metastases in bones, liver, pleura and non-axillary lymph nodes were present in up to 17 patients.
Our major findings include: a) an important clinical underestimation of disease burden in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma; b) a relatively modest disease burden associated with leptomeningeal metastases; c) a higher than anticipated loss of predictive biomarkers in metastases from primary ER+ and/or PR+ tumors (up to 84% and 100% of the patients having at least one ER-negative or PR-negative lesion, respectively), d) a high variability in KI67% between metastases with frequent zonation pattern, and, e) a high frequency of metastases with HER2-low or -ultralow status.
Despite the challenging set-up of UPTIDER, we demonstrate here that the data and observations that emerge from this program have high potential for clinical translatability.
