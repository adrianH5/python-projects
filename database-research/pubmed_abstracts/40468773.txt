In this study, a systematic phytochemical investigation was conducted on the whole herbs of Corydalis imbricata, which led to the determination of two previously unpredicted isoquinoline alkaloids, namely imbricatines A and B (1 and 2), along with 14 known analogs (3-16).
The structures of these compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic data, including one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, infrared, calculated circular dichroism, and comparison with the reported data.
All the obtained compounds (1-16) were evaluated for the inhibitory effect in vitro against two breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7).
The results demonstrated that compounds 3, 6, 7, and 11 exhibited moderate to weak inhibitory activity against MDA-MB-231 cells, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
