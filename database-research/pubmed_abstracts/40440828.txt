Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with 90-95% of cases reported to be SCC.
The present study aimed to investigate the presence of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (cftDNA) in the patient's plasma with OSCC and determine the feasibility of liquid biopsies in genomic profiling using deep sequencing-based approach.
Mutation analysis of cfDNA will help evaluate the molecular and clinical impacts of the identified somatic alterations during primary staging.
