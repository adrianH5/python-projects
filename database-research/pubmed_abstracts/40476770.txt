Polysaccharides have been drawing growing attention due to their potential biological properties and applications in the health industry.
Aucklandia lappa Decne.
not only exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antibacterial, and other activities but also is rich in polysaccharides.
In this study, two polysaccharides (ALN1 and ALN2) were extracted from the roots of Aucklandia lappa Decne.
The structures of ALN1 and ALN2 were analyzed by monosaccharide analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
The results showed that both ALN1 and ALN2 were composed of fructose and glucose with molecular weights of 3.060 and 1.948 kDa, respectively.
The structure of ALN1 was determined to be 1-α-D-Glcp-(-2-β-D-Fruf-1-)
