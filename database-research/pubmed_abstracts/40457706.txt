Therapeutic efficacy of combination therapy could be markedly enhanced when two or more drugs are codelivered to targeted cancer cells, exerting synergistic therapeutic actions.
However, codelivering individual drugs to the same target cells, while minimizing off-target effects, remains challenging.
We report here the synthesis and synergistic anticancer actions of a trimeric prodrug (RqGem), which is rationally designed by leveraging the advantages of self-assembling hybrid prodrugs and cancer redox biology.
RqGem is a self-assembling trimeric prodrug of gemcitabine (GEM), all-
