Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene.
The disease leads to systemic amyloid deposition, primarily affecting the nervous system and, in some cases, the heart.
Early diagnosis and monitoring are critical for effective management, yet reliable biomarkers remain limited.
This study aimed to investigate the role of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) as biomarkers in ATTRv-PN.
