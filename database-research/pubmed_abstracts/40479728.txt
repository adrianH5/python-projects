Adolescents and young adults with cancer (AYA) are faced with making several cancer-related decisions daily (e.g.
managing pain/fatigue).
Many of these decisions involve uncertainty (e.g.
feeling uninformed about alternatives, feeling unsupported about making a choice), even under ideal conditions that have implications for health (e.g.
wear and tear on the body).
The present study examined relationships between decisional conflict within cancer-related decision-making and physiological responding.
