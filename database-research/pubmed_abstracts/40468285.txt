Partial nephrectomy is the gold standard for small renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN), introduced in 2004, has gained acceptance as a minimally invasive approach.
Determining resection margins in complex cases remains a challenge.
5-ALA, a photosensitizer metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), induces red fluorescence under blue light, aiding tumor detection.
Although effective in other malignancies, its utility in renal tumors is not well established.
