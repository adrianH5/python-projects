Acute Myelomonocytic Leukemia (AMML) is a rare malignant neoplasm that is classified as a subtype of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
In the case described herein, the initial pathology results from a lymph node biopsy leaned towards Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis, but ultimately, immunohistochemistry of the lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of Acute Myelomonocytic Leukemia.
