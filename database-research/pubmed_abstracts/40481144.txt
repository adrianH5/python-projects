The essential function of SOX11 in directing mammalian organogenesis is well-established.
Nevertheless, the intricate signaling network it orchestrates, especially during early lung development, remains poorly understood.
This study delves into the role of SOX11 in early lung development using a Sox11 knockout mouse model.
Developmental analyses reveal that pulmonary malformations emerge during branching morphogenesis, characterized by defective epithelial-mesenchymal condensation and reduced intercellular spacing.
