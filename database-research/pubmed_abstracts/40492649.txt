Approximately 3% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) are due to Lynch syndrome (LS), a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by pathogenic variants (PVs) in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.
Patients with CRC and LS have elevated lifetime risks for a range of cancers and require personalized treatment and targeted surveillance.
Relatives of people affected by LS who share the same PV also have elevated cancer risks and can benefit from preventive measures and/or risk-reducing surgeries.
Despite this, LS remains vastly underdiagnosed.
Universal tumor screening (UTS) for deficient MMR is recommended in diagnosing LS in patients with CRC.
This process, when combined with genetic testing (GT) offered within routine cancer care (termed "mainstream GT"), aims to identify individuals at risk efficiently, but integrating UTS and mainstream GT for LS in CRC is a complex endeavor.
