Breast cancer is a type of cancer with relatively good prognosis; however, once it metastasizes to the brain, it deteriorates clinical outcomes.
Previously, we compared the brain-topical proliferative activity of multiple breast cancer cell lines by intracranial injection and identified UACC-893Â cells as highly proliferative in the brain.
In this study, we performed RNA-seq analysis of brains harboring UACC-893 tumors and explored the genes characteristically expressed in tumor cells colonizing the brain and in their surrounding brain tissue.
Enrichment analysis suggested that immune-related signals may be involved in the brain-topical proliferative activity of tumor cells.
In addition, ligand-coding genes were extracted among those characteristically expressed in the intracranial tumor or in the brain containing it.
This result was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis.
NicheNet analysis using RNA-seq data suggested the interaction between tumor cells and the brain microenvironment, which suggested possible communications via the ligand-receptor axis.
In summary, this study highlights the genes and signals characteristic of highly proliferative tumor cells and the affected brain tissue influencing tumor colonization.
