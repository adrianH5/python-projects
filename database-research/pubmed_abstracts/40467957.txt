Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans that are affected by motion often require motion compensation to reduce artifacts or to reconstruct 4D (3D+time) representations of the patient.
To do so, most existing strategies rely on some sort of gating strategy that sorts the acquired projections into motion bins.
Subsequently, these bins can be reconstructed individually before further post-processing may be applied to improve image quality.
While this concept is useful for periodic motion patterns, it fails in case of non-periodic motion as observed, for example, in irregularly breathing patients.
