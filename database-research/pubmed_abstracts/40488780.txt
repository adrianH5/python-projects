Childhood survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin disease (HD) are at risk of long-term cardiopulmonary impairments due to cardiotoxic chemotherapy and inactivity.
This study aims to assess the cardiopulmonary fitness and cardiac function of pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and echocardiography, including strain imaging, to determine the extent of functional limitations and their underlying causes.
This prospective, single-center study included 27 PCS (21 with ALL, 6 with HD) and 27 age-matched healthy controls.
Participants underwent echocardiography with strain analysis and CPET on a treadmill to evaluate cardiac function and exercise capacity.
Key parameters such as ejection fraction (EF), global longitudinal strain (GLS), E/E' ratio, peak oxygen uptake (
