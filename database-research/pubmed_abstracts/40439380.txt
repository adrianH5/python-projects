Tumor cells release fragments of their DNA into the bloodstream, called cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) or liquid biopsy.
In this study, we investigate whether human papillomavirus cell-free tumor DNA (ctHPV DNA) can be detected in patients with cervical cancer or premalignant lesions before and after treatment.
We are also investigating whether ctHPV DNA levels correlate with patient or tumor characteristics and outcomes.
