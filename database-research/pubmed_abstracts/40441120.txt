Inorganic arsenic (iA) exposure is associated with increased risk of lung, bladder, and skin cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
C-reactive protein (CRP), a measurement of inflammation, has been associated with these conditions.
As the relationship between urinary arsenic and CRP remains unclear, we aim to determine if there is an association and to examine effect modification by dietary and lifestyle factors.
