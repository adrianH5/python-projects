Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer therapy in recent years.
In addition to rejuvenating anti-cancer immunity, ICI may cause immune dysregulation, impacting homeostasis, including brain functions.
Thus, the association of ICI with cognitive function needs further investigation.
Using NIH's PROMIS system, this study investigates self-reported cognitive impairment within a diverse cohort of ICI-treated patients.
Additionally, we explore risk factors influencing self-reported cognitive function, including concurrent symptoms and racial/ethnic background.
