Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare, with challenging diagnostics and unfavorable outcomes.
Therefore, more molecular insight into IBC is needed.
The comprehensive Dutch prospective INFLAME registry related IBC follow-up and treatment to histopathology and molecular analysis.
Of consecutive patients, nationwide identified with newly diagnosed IBC, clinicopathological, treatment and outcome data were collected.
Histopathology and RNA-sequencing were related to outcome.
125 IBC patients were enrolled.
Forty-one (34%) patients had HER2 + , and 31 (25%) had triple-negative IBC.
The estimated 3-year OS was 78% in M0 IBC and 29% in M1.
PFS was worst in triple-negative IBC (median 7.9 vs 16.3 and 15.8 months in M1 HER2+ and HR + /HER2- IBC).
DFS and OS in M0 IBC were better with guideline-concordant trimodal therapy than without (HR 0.15 and 0.15; p = 0.000005 and 0.00038).
The unique prospective INFLAME confirms unfavorable IBC characteristics and outcomes.
International efforts may support guideline adherence and identify IBC-specific targets.
