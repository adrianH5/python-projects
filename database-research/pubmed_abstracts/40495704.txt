Teclistamab and elranatamab are bispecific antibodies recently approved for the treatment of triple class-exposed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
This study assessed the relative efficacy and economic value of teclistamab and elranatamab through a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and cost per responder analysis using data from the MajesTEC-1 (NCT03145181/NCT04557098) and MagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359) trials.
