This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of amide proton transfer (APT) imaging and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) histogram parameters in predicting pathologic prognostic factors (lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion) in rectal adenocarcinoma.
Additionally, the study compared the diagnostic performance of these parameters through combined models.
