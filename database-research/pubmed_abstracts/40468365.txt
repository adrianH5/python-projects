Ascites remains the most common complication of cirrhosis and a frequent reason for hospitalisation in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD).
Ascites is associated with significant symptom burden, caregiver workload and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Once refractory to treatment, median survival is poor.
Many with refractory ascites (RA) will neither receive a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) nor a liver transplant.
Palliative care remains underutilised and evidence-based interventions focused on improving HRQoL are clearly needed.
The standard of care for RA is repeated hospital ascites drainage with large volume paracentesis (LVP).
Our earlier feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) (REDUCe) showed acceptability of palliative tunnelled long-term abdominal drains (LTADs), as well as preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy.
The current REDUCe2 trial is a definitive national study designed to assess the impact of palliative LTADs on HRQoL in patients with RA due to ACLD.
