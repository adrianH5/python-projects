Targeted therapies in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have reportedly been associated with better quality of life (QoL).
Previous studies have revealed uncontrolled sources of biases or confounders that could distort this association.
Given the lack of robust evidence and causal inference, we aimed to investigate the effects of targeted therapy-added regimens versus cytotoxic therapy (CyT) on QoL and components of QoL in patients with mCRC eligible for curative-intent treatment.
