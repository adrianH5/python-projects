Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has gained attention for its potential association with cardiovascular risks.
This study aims to examine the association between CRF and adverse cardiovascular outcomes [atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT)] in cancer patients and explore whether enhancing CRF could improve these outcomes.
