The bone shell approach to lateral ridge augmentation has overcome many limitations of the classic block graft and guided bone regeneration approaches.

We propose a screwless simplification of the bone shell approach concerning the posterior mandible lateral defect.
Two cases are described to highlight the unique aspects of each case.
