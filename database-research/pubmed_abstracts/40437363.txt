Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent form of primary liver cancer, associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Despite advancements in diagnostic methods and systemic treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the development of drug resistance remains a significant challenge in HCC management.
Traditional treatments such as surgical resection and transarterial chemoembolization offer limited efficacy, especially in advanced stages.
Although novel therapies like lenvatinib, sorafenib, regorafenib, and ICIs have shown promise, their effectiveness is often hindered by primary and acquired resistance, leading to poor long-term survival outcomes.
This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies in HCC.
Key factors contributing to resistance include alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME), immune evasion, hypoxia, changes in cellular metabolism, and genetic mutations.
Additionally, molecular players such as ferroptosis, autophagy, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, ABC transporters, and non-coding RNAs(ncRNAs) are discussed as contributors to drug resistance.
Understanding these mechanisms is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming resistance, improving patient outcomes, and ultimately enhancing survival rates in HCC patients.
