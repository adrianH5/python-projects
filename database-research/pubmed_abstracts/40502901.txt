Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is a common and often debilitating complication following sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer.
With evolving techniques in surgical oncology, sphincter preservation has become more prevalent; however, this has led to an increased incidence of postoperative bowel dysfunction.
This narrative review explores the current understanding of LARS, including its definition, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, treatment options, and preventive strategies.
Emphasis is placed on both conservative and surgical management approaches, as well as the importance of patient education and multidisciplinary care in improving quality of life.
