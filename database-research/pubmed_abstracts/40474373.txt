Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is routinely used to determine the estrogen receptor (ER) expression status of breast cancer.
18F-fluoro-estradiol (18F-FES) PET/CT is indicated for select breast cancer patients with ER+ breast cancer, and patients with tracer-avid disease typically enjoy favorable responses to endocrine therapy (ET).
We present 2 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were ER+ on IHC but lacked tracer avidity on 18F-FES PET/CT.
We hypothesize that despite ER detection on IHC, these receptors were nonfunctional, lacking the ability to bind estrogen.
Since functional ER is a prerequisite for response to ET, these patients are not likely to respond to ET.
