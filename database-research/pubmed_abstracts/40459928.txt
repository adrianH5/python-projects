Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening inflammation-related vascular disease lacking of specific drugs.
Murine caspase-11 (CASP11, its human orthologs CASP4/CASP5) is the major component of the non-canonical inflammasome.
However, the role of CASP11 in AAA remains unknown.
Using a modified mice model combining oral BAPN administration and periaortic elastase application, we observed the activation of CASP11 during the development of AAA.
