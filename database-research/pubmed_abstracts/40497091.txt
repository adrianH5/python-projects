Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with a high mortality rate.
Early prognosis of esophageal abnormalities can improve patient survival rates.
The progression of esophageal cancer follows a sequence from esophagitis to non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, and eventually esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
This study explored the application of deep learning technology in the precise diagnosis of pathological classification and staging of EAC to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
