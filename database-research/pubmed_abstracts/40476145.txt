Wirsungocele, a cystic dilation at the end of the main pancreatic duct, is associated with recurrent acute pancreatitis.
A 52-year-old man presented to our hospital with recurrent epigastric pain over an 8-month period with a history of multiple medical visits for the same complaint.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed focal cystic dilatation at the end of the main pancreatic duct; thus, he was diagnosed with Wirsungocele.
He underwent endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy and 5Fr 4Â cm pancreatic duct stent placement; the pancreatic duct stent was removed 1 month later.
Magnetic resonance imaging performed 3 months after discharge revealed no cystic dilation, and he has had no recurrence of pancreatitis for at least 6 months.
Dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi, weakening of the pancreatic duct wall, inflammation and recurrent stress, elevated intraductal pressure, and genetic and structural factors are suspected mechanisms behind the pathophysiology of Wirsungocele.
Although the etiology of Wirsungocele is not known, its timely identification and treatment are critical to preventing recurrent episodes of pancreatitis.
This case demonstrates the diagnostic value of combining MRCP and EUS as well as the therapeutic benefits of endoscopic intervention, including sphincterotomy and stent placement, in managing Wirsungocele-associated recurrent pancreatitis.
Given the paucity of reports on recurrent pancreatitis due to the Wirsungocele, we herein report this case and review the literature.
