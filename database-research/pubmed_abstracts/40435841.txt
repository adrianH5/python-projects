Limited data on the evolution of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status within the course of disease increases the risk of inaccuracies in deciding on Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy and questions the necessity for confirmatory biopsies in clinical trials.
This study aims to assess HRD status over time and its role as a dynamic biomarker.
