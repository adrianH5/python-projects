Melanocytic nevi (MN) and atypical melanocytic nevi (AMN) are established risk factors for cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), with patients exhibiting atypical mole syndrome (AMS) facing an even greater risk.
Peripheral blood biomarkers-including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (ELR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII)-have been linked to various cancers, including CMM.
This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between these biomarkers and MN and AMS, which are common phenotypes among melanoma patients.
