Drug delivery systems typically need to be equipped with targeting moieties in order to be efficiently internalized by cells.
Alternatively, magnetic nanoparticles (MNs) combined with active compounds may be driven by magnetic field to the site of action.
Delivery of hydrophobic drugs using this approach is challenging as it would require coupling of MNs and hydrophobic environment within nanocarriers and triggering of the drug release.
