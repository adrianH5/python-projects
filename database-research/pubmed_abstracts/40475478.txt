Robust growth control is an essential requirement for the survival of living organisms, while its dysregulation results in diseases such as cancer.
However, a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding how precise organ growth control is achieved.
The growing arsenal of optogenetic toolkits allows precise, noninvasive control of cellular signaling in vivo, enabling research into how bioelectrical and chemical cues regulate organ growth.
Here, we used the red-light-activated channelrhodopsin, CsChrimson, to stimulate intracellular calcium signaling dynamics in the wing epithelium of
