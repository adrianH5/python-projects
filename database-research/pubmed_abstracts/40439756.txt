Randomized trials have progressively enabled the de-escalation of axillary surgery in breast cancer (BC) patients, reducing adverse events without compromising survival.
Despite a not negligible rate of residual disease in the axilla after sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure, the risk of regional lymph node recurrence (RLNR) is very low, due probably to multimodal adjuvant treatments.
The characteristics of the small number of patients with RLNR remain poorly characterized and warrant further investigation, especially given their poor prognosis and the current context of ongoing studies exploring further de-escalation of axillary surgery.
