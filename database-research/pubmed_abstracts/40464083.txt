Calcitonin (CT) represents the most important biochemical marker of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), but has certain limits.
Procalcitonin (ProCT) has been recognized as an alternative or additional marker for MTC.
The aim of the study is to evaluate prospectively the role of ProCT combined with CT in the identification of MTC.
