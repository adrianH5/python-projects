Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the main treatment modalities for cancer.
In France, radiation therapists (RTTs) undergo a combined training program in radiography, nuclear medicine, and RT.
In the context of rising cancer cases and greater utilisation of RT, RT departments face a workforce shortage.
This study investigates the interest of final-year radiography students in working in RT and explores deterrents to their career choice.
A survey was conducted in January 2024 among French radiography students who had completed at least 3Â weeks of RT clinical placement.
The survey included closed and open-ended questions on career preferences and highlighted barriers to working in RT.
Data analysis included absolute number, frequency of students wishing to work in RT according to the age range of the students.
A Chi square test was used to assess the influence of the age range on the desire to work in RT field.
A thematic analysis of free-text responses was also performed.
The results indicated a low interest in a career in RT among students, with the main reasons being psychological and educational barriers.
Enhancing RT-specific education, improving clinical placements, addressing emotional resilience, and modernising training programmes are crucial to attract future RTTs and address workforce shortages in this critical field.
