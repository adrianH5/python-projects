Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant global public health challenge, and its incidence and mortality rates among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 15-39 years are increasing.
Compared with older adults, AYAs often face poorer prognoses and a higher disease burden.
Understanding the trends and determinants of BC burden in AYAs is crucial for guiding preventive measures, early detection programs, and treatment strategies.
The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the trends and distribution of the BC burden among AYAs aged 15-39 years across regions and countries and identify the contributing risk factors and disparities in incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
