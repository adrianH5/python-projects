Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with (chemo)-radiotherapy before abdominoperineal resection (APR) are at high risk of developing pelvic organ/space surgical site infection (O/S-SSI).
This increases morbidity and prolongs length of stay.
Vague symptoms delay diagnosis.
In microdialysis, thin catheters are placed in tissue enabling monitoring of metabolism.
We hypothesize that local metabolic changes related to O/S-SSI might be detected by microdialysis.
