Significant advances in matrix biology research have enhanced our understanding of individual matrix components and extracellular matrix (ECM) signalling.
The dysregulation of the ECM during the development of solid tumours is a critical area of investigation.
Despite recent progress, further investigation into the role of the ECM in cancer progression and therapeutic targeting remains essential for improving outcomes.
This study is especially relevant for ECM-rich cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, which is characterised by dense fibrosis that impacts all stages of tumour development, including initiation, progression, and chemoresistance.
Currently, no matrix-targeting agents have achieved mainstream clinical implementation.
Challenges in this field include insufficient integration of new technologies, and limited understanding of cross disciplinary influences and of the complex, multifunctional nature of the ECM.
In this review, we highlight key areas of matrix biology research that are crucial for advancing cancer treatment.
