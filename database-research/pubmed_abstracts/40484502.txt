Approximately 1.6 million people in the United States alone are diagnosed annually with a pulmonary nodule.
Clinicians are tasked with determining the etiology and assessing which nodule may represent cancer.
Nodule calculators use patient demographics and nodule characteristics to assess the likelihood of cancer, and biomarkers may improve risk assessment.
Appropriate risk stratification and adherence to guideline-concordant management limits unnecessary invasive testing.
When tissue acquisition is necessary, the clinician should understand the risks and benefits of various diagnostic modalities.
