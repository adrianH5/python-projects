Limited data on the potential safety risk of vaccine-associated transverse myelitis (TM) is available.
Thus, we aimed to identify the global burden and clinical features of vaccine-associated TM to facilitate tailored monitoring of potential adverse vaccine reactions.
This study used data from the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database, which contains over 35 million reports from over 140 countries.
We extracted individual case safety reports from 1967 to 2023.
To investigate the potential association between 19 vaccines and TM, we calculated global reporting counts, reported odds ratios (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and information components (IC) with IC
