Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approved in multiple countries for relapsed/refractory metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) based on results from the phase III ASCENT study.
The incidence of obesity has grown to epidemic proportions in recent decades; it is unclear what impact this has on treatment outcomes, especially for ADCs like SG that have weight-based dosing.
We report the association of body mass index (BMI) with efficacy and safety of SG versus chemotherapy among patients with mTNBC from the ASCENT study.
