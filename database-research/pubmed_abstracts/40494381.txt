A 65-year-old woman presented with whole-body pain after a radical gastrectomy of gastric cancer.
The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial of comparison 18F-FDG and 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT in recurrent gastrointestinal tumor (No.
IIT-2022-015#HYX#).
Compared with non-18F-FDG avidity, 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT showed diffuse inhomogeneous intense tracer uptake of bone marrow.
Subsequent bone marrow biopsy confirmed recurrent gastric cancer.
This case revealed 18F-FAPI-04 might be a promising radiopharmaceutical in the evaluation of bone marrow metastasis from recurrent gastric cancer.
