Three-dimensional spheroid cultures of crypts from the duodenum, upper jejunum, and ileum of beagle dog were established to investigate species differences in drug transport and metabolism.
Four differentiation conditions were tested using jejunum-derived cells: base medium (BM; without Wnt3a, R-spondin 3, and Noggin), BM plus epidermal growth factor (BM + EGF), EGF/Noggin/R-spondin 3 (ENR) for liquid-liquid interface (LLI), and ENR for air-liquid interface (ALI).
