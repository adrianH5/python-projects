The Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM) is a voluntary, risk-based payment model implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to improve cancer care while reducing the total cost of care (TCOC).
The US Oncology Network (The Network) comprises approximately 50% of all prescribers participating in EOM nationwide across 12 practice sites.
In The Network, drug costs represented an average of 63% of a patient's TCOC.
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the impact of a remote clinical pharmacist in reducing TCOC in the EOM.
