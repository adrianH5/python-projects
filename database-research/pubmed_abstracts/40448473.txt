In recent years, forsterite (Fo, Mg₂SiO₄) has emerged as a promising biomaterial for bone tissue engineering scaffolds, demonstrating efficacy in inhibiting the growth of clinical bacterial isolates.
In addition, rare-earth (RE) doped Fo exhibits excitation properties that match the near-infrared (NIR) biological transparency window (700-1800 nm), facilitating deep penetration into biological tissues.
Despite these advantageous properties, data on the toxicity of RE-doped forsterite is lacking, and effects on damaged or dysfunctional cells, such as cancer cells, are not known.
The aim of this study was to examine the toxicity of RE-doped forsterite nanoparticles (NPs) in cultures of healthy and tumor skin cells.
Specifically, forsterite doped with Er
