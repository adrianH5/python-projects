The Notch signaling pathway is essential for cell fate decisions and maintaining epigenetic memory during nervous system development.
It regulates neural stem cell maintenance, neuronal-glial differentiation, and neural circuit formation.
Notch activation, through ligand-receptor interactions, releases the Notch intracellular domain, which modulates gene expression in the nucleus.
This context-dependent regulation allows Notch to balance proliferation and differentiation, integrating with other pathways and epigenetic regulators to preserve neural stem cell identity and respond to environmental cues.
Notch signaling dysfunction is linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its critical role in nervous system development and homeostasis.
This review explores the multifaceted functions of Notch signaling, emphasizing its impact on cell fate and epigenetic memory in early neurogenesis and the adult brain.
