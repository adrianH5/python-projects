Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who do not respond to standard of care treatment can have activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (cMET) signaling pathways, as well as having enhanced levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
To combat such resistance mechanisms, TAVO412, was engineered to control aberrant cMET, VEGF-A, and EGFR activities.
