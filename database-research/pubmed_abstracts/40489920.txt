Recently, the incidence of breast cancer has increased among postmenopausal women.
This highlights the need for improved aromatase inhibitors with fewer side effects than those currently available.
This study focuses on designing and evaluating potential aromatase inhibitors containing the 1,2,4-triazole/indole hybrid, given their proven impact in this respect.
Accordingly, by exploiting the thiol and amine groups in 5-((1H-indole-3-yl)methyl)-4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (2) to react with some reagents, new hybrid 1,2,4-triazole-indole compounds were obtained.
A cytotoxicity (MTT) test was conducted to assess the anticancer activity of the newly synthesized compounds on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7.
The results of the MTT assay indicated that compounds 4d and 5 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 cancer cell lines with IC
