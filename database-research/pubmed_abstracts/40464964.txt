Esophageal cancer (EC), especially esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in China, is a major cause of cancer-related mortality.
While lymph node (LN) dissection is crucial for staging and prognosis in early-stage EC, the optimal extent of dissection based on tumor location remains undefined.
This study aimed to establish location-specific LN dissection thresholds to improve outcomes in clinical T1-2N0M0 ESCC.
