Macrophage polarization, a dynamic process crucial for immune responses and tissue homeostasis, is tightly regulated by transcription factors.
Understanding the transcriptional regulation of macrophage polarization holds significant therapeutic implications for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and metabolic syndromes.
Studies have shown that transcription factors, including signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), BTB and CNC homology (BACH), CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs), kruppel-like factors (KLFs), Cellular Myc (c-Myc), the SNAIL family, v-Maf Musculoaponeurotic Fibrosarcoma Oncogene Homolog (Maf), and hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα), are highly involved in shaping macrophage polarization.
Targeting transcription factors involved in macrophage polarization may provide promising avenues for immunomodulatory therapies aimed at restoring immune homeostasis and combating pathological conditions characterized by dysregulated macrophage activation.
Here, we review the intricate transcriptional networks that govern macrophage polarization, highlighting the pivotal role of transcription factors in orchestrating these processes.
