Adrenal gland tumors, including both benign and malignant forms, are increasingly detected due to advancements in imaging techniques.
This prospective study, conducted at Nepal Mediciti Hospital evaluated thirteen patients diagnosed with adrenal masses, all confirmed benign via contrast-enhanced computed tomography.
Functional assessment, preoperative endocrinological and anesthesiological evaluations and pharmacological preparations were conducted as needed.
All patients underwent successful lateral transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy, performed by a single surgeon.
The study population had a female predominance (9 females, 4 males), with tumor sizes ranging from 2 to 9 cm.
No surgeries required conversion to open procedures, and postoperative outcomes were favorable, with no mortality or re-operations.
Complications were minimal, including transient blood pressure elevation in one pheochromocytoma case and one postoperative chest infection.
Histopathological findings included aldosterone-producing adenomas, cortisol-producing adenomas, and pheochromocytomas.
The study supports the continued use of laparoscopic adrenalectomy as the preferred surgical method for adrenal tumors.
