Peritumoral characteristics demonstrate significant predictive value for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response in breast cancer (BC) through tumor-stromal interactions.
Radiomics analysis of peritumoral regions has shown robust capability in predicting treatment outcomes; however, the optimal peritumoral thickness for maximizing predictive accuracy remains undefined.
