Respiratory infections in patients with cancer are common.
A low threshold for bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be maintained in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary opacities on chest imaging to evaluate for opportunistic infections.
In those with unresolving symptoms, transbronchial biopsies may add significant diagnostic value.
Concomitant hypercalcemia in patients with cancer is typically related to underlying malignant disease.
However, in those with persistent respiratory symptoms or atypical infiltrates then granulomatous inflammatory diseases should be considered.
Diagnosing histoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients can be difficult.
Antigen testing is often more sensitive, but tissue biopsy or culture may be needed.
We describe a case of histoplasmosis with persistent pulmonary opacities and hypercalcemia diagnosed via transbronchial biopsy, with subsequent clinical and radiographic improvement after treatment.
