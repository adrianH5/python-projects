The SWitch/sucrose non-fermentable chromatin remodeling complex functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating gene expression and thus various cellular processes.
Key subunits of this complex, including the AT-rich interactive domain (ARID)-containing proteins ARID1A, ARID1B and ARID2, are frequently mutated in cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC).
However, their protein expression and prognostic significance in CRC remain unclear.
The present study investigated the ARID1A, ARID1B and ARID2 expression levels in CRC tissues and their relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics of patients.
Bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas-colon adenocarcinoma cohort revealed frequent mutations, positive mRNA correlations among the
