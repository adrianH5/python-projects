Cancer cases are rising in India.
However, despite attempts to make cancer a notifiable disease, the Ministry of Health in India has resisted this.
Their reasoning is that cancer is not a communicable disease and does not have community spread.

Robust record keeping would allow real-time epidemiological analysis and highlight those areas where priority could be given to both prevent and treat cancer.
