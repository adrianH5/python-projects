Increasing science inquiry that aligns with curriculum standards is emerging as a critical path for science education.
Our programming leverages developmental biology to engage students in expansive topics in life sciences that are tailored for each classroom curriculum.
These curricula foster a scientific community of practice that prepares today's high school students for future STEM careers.
Using developmental stages of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, students learn basic laboratory techniques, how to design research trials, write hypotheses, and collect and analyze data.
After completing the project, student scientists engage in science communication with professional scientists, peers, and the public at an Annual Research Symposium, solidifying their membership in the scientific community.
A core value of the programming is supporting classrooms to design their research to address health concerns of personal importance.
This "soul science", an authentic research approach, enables establishment of essential research competencies and prepares students to become health advocates for those they love.
This article describes programs designed to increase science inquiry among high school students and their teachers and to encourage the application of experimental outcomes to cancer and disease research.
