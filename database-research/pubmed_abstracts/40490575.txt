Ammonia metabolism plays a crucial role in cancer progression and immune modulation.
However, the prognostic relevance and immunological effects of ammonia-induced cell death (ACD) in HNSC remain insufficiently studied.
ACD is a newly characterized form of regulated cell death caused by pathological ammonia accumulation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and DNA damage.
