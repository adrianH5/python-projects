Patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain at high risk of developing local recurrence and distant metastases.
Some patients do respond well to treatment but still have residual disease or develop locoregional failure within 1-2 years.
Treatment options are limited in such cases with dismal survival outcomes.
This study was done to assess the role of Gefitinib in residual, recurrent, and metastasis HNSCC.
