Primary liver cancers are the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
Despite the availability of chemotherapeutics, immunotherapies and anti-angiogenic drugs, survival rates have not improved.
Worse, most patients do not respond to the most effective therapies.
Patient stratification is necessary to increase the likelihood of effective treatment.
More targeted therapies are definitely needed.
Here, we provide an overview of the role of Fascin-1, an F-actin-bundling protein, in cell migration and invasion.
We focus on its impact and clinical relevance in liver tumorigenesis.
We propose Fascin-1 as a marker of poor prognosis for primary liver cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma.
Fascin-1 is found to be overexpressed in all these cancers and is usually associated with undifferentiated tumors and worse outcomes.
We then review current approaches to targeting Fascin-1 in primary liver cancers.
Finally, we offer perspectives that may foster cancer research and open new avenues for Fascin-targeted therapies in liver cancers and beyond.
