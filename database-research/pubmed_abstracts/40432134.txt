Breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), particularly those enriched in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are key contributors to tumor recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to therapy.
CSCs often undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), enhancing their invasiveness.
Immune-based strategies that selectively target CSC/EMT antigens offer a promising therapeutic approach.
