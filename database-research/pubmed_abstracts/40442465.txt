Treatment pathways for low-risk thyroid cancer have seen broad de-escalation over the past two decades.
A condition once treated predominantly with total thyroidectomy with selective adjuvant radioactive iodine is now frequently treated with partial thyroidectomy alone or even active surveillance among carefully selected patients.
Over the same period, percutaneous ablative treatment for benign thyroid nodules has expanded.
Inevitably, there evolved a growing interest in the application of ablative therapy to lowrisk thyroid cancer as an intermediate option between surveillance and resection.
This article introduces the most common modalities for percutaneous ablation of thyroid cancer, summarizes contemporary evidence, highlights gaps in knowledge, and proposes a set of real-world practice recommendations.
