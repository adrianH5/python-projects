Intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) are effective tools for the management of chronic non-cancer pain, cancer-associated pain, and spasticity.
Given the overall risks of opioid medications, it is imperative that IDDS opioid-infusion patients receive education regarding the risks versus benefits of their intrathecal opioid medications and that controlled substance agreements (CSAs) are utilized to both educate patients and hold them accountable for keeping IDDS programming visits, refill appointments, or other IDDS maintenance appointments.
