Navitoclax (oral B-cell lymphoma-2 family protein inhibitor induces apoptosis of malignant cells in myelofibrosis (MF).
We present pooled cohort 1 results from the phase 2 REFINE trial, which evaluated navitoclax plus ruxolitinib (NAV+RUX) for patients with relapsed/refractory MF with suboptimal response to RUX (≥10 mg twice daily stable dose for ≥12 weeks [cohort 1a] or ≥24 weeks [cohort 1b]).
Cohort 1a received add-on NAV 50 mg/d, with escalation to ≤300 mg if platelet count was ≥75 × 10
