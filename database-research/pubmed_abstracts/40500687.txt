After chemoradiotherapy (CRT), 30%-50% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) relapse, highlighting the unmet need for prognostic biomarkers.
In the global randomized CALLA trial (NCT03830866), the addition of durvalumab during and after CRT did not significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) in a biomarker-unselected intent-to-treat population.
We analyzed the association of ultrasensitive circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating human papillomavirus (cHPV) DNA detection with relapse and survival in the largest dataset in LACC to date.
