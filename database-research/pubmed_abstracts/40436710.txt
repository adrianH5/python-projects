Early detection of malignant lesions in ultrasound images is crucial for effective cancer diagnosis and treatment.
While traditional methods rely on radiologists, deep learning models can improve accuracy, reduce errors, and enhance efficiency.
This study explores the application of a deep learning model for classifying benign and malignant lesions, focusing on its performance and interpretability.
