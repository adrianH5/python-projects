Transrectal ultrasound, particularly in the combination of high-frequency ultrasound and MR-TRUS fusion technologies, provides a highly precise and effective method for correlation and targeted biopsy of suspicious intraprostatic lesions detected by MRI.
Advances in imaging technology, driven by 29 Mhz micro-ultrasound transducers, robotic-assisted systems, and the integration of AI-based analyses, promise further improvements in diagnostic accuracy and a reduction in unnecessary biopsies.
Further technological advancements and improved TRUS training could contribute to a decentralized and cost-effective diagnostic evaluation of prostate cancer in the future.
