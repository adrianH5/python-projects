The research on astragalus polysaccharides (APS) in pancreatic cancer has garnered increasing interest due to its potential therapeutic benefits.
APS, derived from the Astragalus membranaceus plant, exhibits diverse biological activities, including immune modulation and anti-tumor effects.
In this study, we presented a retrospective analysis study exploring the potential benefits of combining APS with gemcitabine plus tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule (S-1) in pancreatic cancer treatment.
The finding suggests that APS may enhance treatment efficacy, improve immune function, and reduce adverse reactions, offering a valuable complementary approach to standard chemotherapy.
Further research is needed to validate these findings and optimize APS usage in clinical practice.
This combination therapy represents a compelling avenue for improving pancreatic cancer management and may ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes.
