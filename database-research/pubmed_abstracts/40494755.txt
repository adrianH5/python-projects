Breast cancer remains the malignant tumor with the highest incidence among female patients globally, and its treatment represents a well-recognized clinical challenge.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts a substantial influence on breast cancer progression, whereby alterations in its internal molecular components ultimately impact disease outcomes.
Key factors implicated in this process include adipokines and microRNAs (miRNAs).
This review provides a detailed description of how different adipocytokines exert specific mechanistic effects on breast cancer cells.
By integrating adipokines with miRNAs, the discussion explores their combined roles in the initiation and progression of breast cancer, addressing a previously unaddressed research gap in studies focusing solely on individual adipokines.
Furthermore, by examining the interactions between miRNAs and signaling pathways, this analysis offers a holistic perspective on the TME network, thereby fostering new therapeutic insights for breast cancer management.
