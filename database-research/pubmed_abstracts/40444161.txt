Despite great advances in cancer identification and treatment, malignancies remain the primary cause of high morbidity and mortality worldwide.
The drawbacks of conventional chemotherapy, such as severe toxicity, lack of specificity related to actively dividing cells, and resistance, can warrant the urgent need to develop an alternative approach to treat this disease.
To overcome the drawbacks, researchers are attempting to deliver drugs to the site of action (targeted delivery) or to identify drugs that specifically target tumor cells.
In this regard, highly cationic and amphipathic antimicrobial peptides are attracting the attention of researchers due to their potent anticancer activity, low cost of manufacture, and, most critically, tumor-targeting activity.
A growing number of documents have shown that some of the mentioned peptides exhibited a broad spectrum of cytotoxic activity against cancer cells but not normal mammalian cells entitled as anticancer peptides.
Due to their solubility, low toxicity, strong tumor penetration, high selectivity, and ability to be used alone or in conjunction with other conventional medications, anticancer peptides have the potential to become very successful cancer treatments in the future.
This review provided an overview of the studies concerning anticancer peptide classification, modes of action, and selectivity, and also summarized some of the anticancer peptides developed for targeting different types of malignancies.
