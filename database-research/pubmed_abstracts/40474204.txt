Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally, with a significant association between MASLD and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
While bariatric surgery (BS) has showed efficacy in improving MASLD markers and reducing CVD incidence, its impact on macrovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with obesity, MASLD, and T2DM remains understudied.
