Metreleptin is a form of leptin replacement therapy used with diet and lifestyle modifications to treat the metabolic complications of leptin deficiency in lipodystrophy, a rare disease characterized by adipose tissue deficiency.
Previously, identification of T-cell lymphomas in three metreleptin-treated patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL) suggested a possible relationship between metreleptin and lymphoma development.
To further investigate this, we performed a real-world pharmacovigilance assessment and literature review to identify lymphomas in patients with lipodystrophy and congenital leptin deficiency (CLD) who were either metreleptin-na√Øve, or who had previously received/were receiving metreleptin at the time of lymphoma diagnosis.
