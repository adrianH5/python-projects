The global incidence of obesity has risen dramatically in recent decades, with consequent detrimental health effects.
Extensive studies have demonstrated that obesity significantly affects the risk, prognosis, and progression of various cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM).
As an established modifiable risk factor for both MM and its precursor stages -monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and smoldering MM (SMM)- the association between obesity and disease onset has become a compelling area of research.
This review presents a comprehensive overview of the current epidemiological evidence linking obesity to MM, emphasizing its role in disease pathogenesis and patient outcomes.
It also offers insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this deleterious association, and discusses therapeutic strategies targeting obesity-driven contributions to MM.
