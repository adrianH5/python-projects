Canine malignant insulinoma is a rare, highly metastatic and life-threatening neuroendocrine tumour of pancreatic beta cells.
To map the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of canine insulinoma for the first time, transcriptomic profiles of 5,532 cells were captured from two spontaneous insulinomas (Patient 1 and 2) and one associated metastasis (Patient 2) in two Boxer dogs.
Distinct cancer, endocrine, and immune cell populations were identified.
Notably, all three tumour samples contained two transcriptionally distinct insulin-expressing tumour cell populations (INS
