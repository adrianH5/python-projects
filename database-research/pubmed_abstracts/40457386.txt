The evolving molecular portrait of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has exposed previously unrecognized cell death programs that fuel disease progression and treatment resistance-uncovering untapped therapeutic potential.
Recent work has uncovered disulfidptosis-a novel form of programmed cell death (PDC) triggered by glucose deprivation in SLC7A11-high AML cells-as a potential therapeutic vulnerability.
However, disulfidptosis in pediatric AML (pAML) remains largely unexplored, with no comprehensive studies assessing its biological significance or clinical prognostic value.
