The optimal timing of radical prostatectomy (RP) after prostate cancer diagnosis is controversial, particularly concerning the impact of surgical delays on oncological outcomes.
While active surveillance is standard for low-risk prostate cancer, the effects of delaying surgery in intermediate- and high-risk patients are less clear.
We aimed to evaluate the impact of surgical delays exceeding 9 months on pathological outcomes: upstaging (pT ≥ 3a), upgrading (ISUP ≥ 4) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients undergoing RP with a localized disease.
