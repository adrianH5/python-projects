Microtubules are important components of the cytoskeleton.
Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), including Chinese ethnic medicines, such as Uighur medicines, Li ethnic medicines, Dong ethnic medicines, Lisu ethnic medicines, and Tujia ethnic medicines, can act on microtubules and tubulin, inhibit microtubule polymerization or promote microtubule depolymerization.
In this paper, we review the microtubule-binding sites, summarize the mechanisms by which the active TCM and ethnic medicine ingredients and their derivatives inhibit microtubules, and look forward to applying TCMs and ethnic medicines to inhibit microtubules for cancer treatment.
