Lung cancer and TB pose significant global health challenges, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where they contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality rates, partly due to high smoking prevalence and delays in diagnosis and treatment.
Understanding the association between lung cancer and TB is paramount, as it profoundly affects clinical outcomes and treatment approaches.
This review examines the complex relationship between the two conditions, synthesizing findings from 20 studies retrieved through a PubMed search.
Individuals with a history of TB disease or TB infection face an elevated risk of developing lung cancer, whereas lung cancer can negatively affect TB prognosis and treatment outcomes.
We provide updated insights on the mechanisms underlying this association, and the risk factors for these conditions, to guide future research and enhance clinical management strategies, particularly in LMICs.
