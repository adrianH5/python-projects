After sphincter-sparing rectal cancer surgery many patients experience bowel dysfunction, known as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS).
Major LARS significantly impacts quality of life (QOL).
Patients without LARS or with minor LARS report fewer bowel-related issues This study aims to investigate the dynamics in the experiences, information and counselling needs of patients with or without minor LARS to create a comprehensive overview of LARS.
