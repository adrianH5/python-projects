Evidence-guided regimens for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) in patients with performance status 2 (PS 2) are limited.
Here, we proposed a structured therapeutic framework termed "performance status-matched strategy", and further conducted the APICAL-GC trial (NCT04278222).
This open-label, single-arm phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with toripalimab among 24 treatment-na√Øve AGC patients with PS 2.
The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR), with secondary endpoints including disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profile.
This trial met its prespecified endpoints, demonstrating an ORR of 58.3% (95%CI 36.6-77.9) with a DoR of 12.1 months (range: 1.43-48.5), and a DCR of 95.8% (95%CI 78.9-99.9).
Median PFS reached 7.33 months (95%CI 3.83-17.1), while median OS was 15.9 months (95%CI 7.73-23.2).
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 21 patients (87.5%), with grade-3 TRAEs observed in 7 patients (29.2%).
No grade-4/5 TRAEs were reported.
These findings provide a rationale for anlotinib plus toripalimab as a promising chemotherapy-free option for the first-line treatment of AGC patients with PS 2 under the performance status-matched strategy, showing comparable anticancer activity and a lower occurrence rate of TRAEs.
