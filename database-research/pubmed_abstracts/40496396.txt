In patients with advanced cancer, the prevalence rate of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is high, and the prognosis of patients with CAN is generally poor.
Although mechanisms including inflammation, infection, metabolism, neurodegeneration, toxic processes, and cancer treatment have been proposed as etiologies of CAN in cancer patients, these mechanisms have not been completely elucidated, and their relationship has only been described indirectly.
A study involving 127 cancer patients revealed that both the disease and its treatments can lead to a decrease in heart rate variability (HRV) indicating the autonomic imbalance.
Because managing CAN is essential for improving the survival and quality of life of patients with cancer, patients and specialists can work together to customize cancer treatment and management using HRV as an index.
