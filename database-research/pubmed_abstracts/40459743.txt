Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has served as a screening tool for prostate cancer (PCa) for over 30 years, but its low specificity remains a significant limitation.
Liquid biopsy based on promoter methylation, an epigenetic modification, holds significant potential to complement PSA testing and enhance the diagnostic accuracy of PCa.
Our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of liquid biopsy for promoter methylation in PCa.
