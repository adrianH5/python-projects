Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is associated with significant postoperative pain.
Multimodal analgesia, including single-shot paravertebral blocks (SPVBs), is widely used but provides limited analgesic duration.
Intercostal cryoanalgesia, which offers prolonged pain relief, presents a promising adjunctive option.
This study aimed to assess the analgesic benefit of intercostal cryoanalgesia in VATS lung cancer surgery.
The primary outcome was thoracic pain during cough 24 hours post-surgery, measured via a Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS).
