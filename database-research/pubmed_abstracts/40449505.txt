Cancer is a global health challenge, with considerable disparities in care and outcomes across regions.
Up to half of health outcome disparities are driven by social determinants of health.
Addressing these disparities has become a priority.
The Commonwealth of Nations-an international association of 56 countries tied together by common language and historical heritage-has a focus on universal health coverage, yet cancer incidence rates are rising, especially in the low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) member nations, where cancers caused by communicable diseases, such as cervical cancer, are prevalent.
Although high-income Commonwealth countries have better health coverage, LMICs are hindered by fewer resources, leading to preventable cases.
In this scoping review, we characterise the cancer care inequities within the Commonwealth, and propose a framework to inform research and policy to improve outcomes across health systems.
