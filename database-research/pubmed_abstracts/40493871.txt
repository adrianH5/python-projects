Patient-centered physician-directed care is facing unprecedented challenges.
Escalating health care spending on low-value services with a focus on managing disease rather than promoting health is leading to increasing financial toxicity to patients and payment pushback by insurers.
In an effort to rein in costs, policymakers are implementing legislation and regulations aimed at curbing spending that have had the unintentional consequences of increasing market consolidations, ultimately creating monopolies and monopsonies that have driven up costs, lowered quality, and ultimately disenfranchises both doctors and patients.
The ramifications of such policies have opened the floodgates to the corporatization of medicine.
