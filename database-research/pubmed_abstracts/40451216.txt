Benzene series (BTEX) pollutants are hazardous organic compounds that are widely distributed in water, air, and soil and pose a significant threat to global public security.
The presence of BTEX in surface waters in arid regions and its associated health risks, as well as the primary influencing factors, are crucial concerns that impede the protection and management of water environments in these areas.
By employing a combination of the Monte Carlo risk assessment model and the geographical detector model, this study elucidates the health risks associated with benzene-based compounds in surface water within the Tarim Basin (TRB), China's largest inland basin, while identifying the primary driving forces influencing their distribution in the research area.
The findings indicated that the benzene and styrene concentrations exceeded the regulatory thresholds of China in over 30% of the water samples, and the BTEX levels in the TRB varied between 0.01 and 1.11 μg/mL, with an average concentration of 0.17 ± 0.26 μg/mL.
Differences in BTEX types and concentrations were observed among the sub-basins, with the Yarkant and Hotan Rivers being the most polluted.
Conservative health risk assessments indicated that BTEX did not pose a noncarcinogenic or cancer risk to adults.
However, the health risks for children were consistently higher than those for adults, particularly in specific areas of the Hotan and Weigan River Basins, where the noncarcinogenic risk index for children exceeded one and requires immediate attention.
The distribution of BTEX was influenced by multiple factors, with land use exerting the most significant impact.
Moreover, the interaction between environmental factors was found to augment the explanatory capacity of the BTEX distribution.
These findings provide decision-making guidance for the regulation of BTEX pollution in surface water in arid regions.
PRACTITIONER POINTS: BTEX compounds were widely detected in surface waters of the Tarim River Basin.
Benzene and styrene concentrations exceeded regulatory limits in over 30% of samples.
BTEX posed higher noncarcinogenic risks to children compared to adults.
Interactions between environmental factors enhanced explanatory power for BTEX distribution.
Adjusting land use and strengthening traffic pollution control can reduce BTEX impacts.
