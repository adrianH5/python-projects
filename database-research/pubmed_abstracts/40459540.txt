Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapies are a powerful tool in the clinical management of cancer, but response rates to ICB remain limited, and treatment-related toxicities can be significant.
Therapeutic efficacy of ICB can be enhanced by delivering synergistic immunomodulators to tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs).
However, achieving sustained release of small molecule immunomodulators into the lymphatics and TdLNs remains challenging.
To address this limitation, a sustained release system for delivering an oligonucleotide adjuvant to lymph nodes (LNs) was developed.
CpG oligonucleotide was complexed with a redox-responsive cationic polymer and mixed with F127-
