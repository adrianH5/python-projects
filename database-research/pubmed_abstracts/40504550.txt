Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) was shown to have comparable efficacy to doxorubicin, with significantly reduced cardiotoxicity.
This study evaluated the cardiotoxicity and efficacy of the PLD-based regimen compared with those of the doxorubicin-based regimen as adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer (BC).
