BACKGROUND Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma is a subtype of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and is a rare and highly vascular malignant childhood tumor, with the most common sites of origin being the vagina and cervix in young girls.
This report describes the case of a 15-year-old girl presenting with vaginal hemorrhage due to botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma treated with emergency radiation therapy.
Hemorrhage in botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma can present as a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention.
This case highlights the role of emergency external radiation therapy as a valuable adjunct in managing hemorrhage in botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma, especially when surgical options are limited.
CASE REPORT We report a case of a 15-year-old girl who experienced repeated profuse episodes of vaginal bleeding and protruding mass in the vagina for 2 months.
She had no significant medical history or family history of cancer.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a massive malignant mass in the vaginal introitus that infiltrated the cervix, extending to the uterus.
Based on the histopathology result, the diagnosis was botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma with a primary site located on the cervix, and due to the emergency situation and the risks associated with surgical intervention, emergency external radiation therapy was initiated.
After 1 session of radiation therapy, the bleeding was significantly reduced.
CONCLUSIONS Hemorrhage in botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare but critical complication.
Emergency external radiation therapy helps stabilize the patient with acute bleeding caused by botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma.
Further research is needed to find the optimal treatment strategies.
