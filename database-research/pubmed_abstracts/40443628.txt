Although many HPV infections resolve on their own, some high-risk types may persist and gradually develop into cervical cancer over several years, providing opportunities for early detection and intervention.
However, in low-resource settings like Kilifi County, HPV testing is limited, and alternative screening methods like visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) are commonly used despite their limitations.
