The objective of this paper is to describe 7 years of implementation of a multi-sector, whole community cancer prevention program and share lessons learned in multi-sector capacity and partnership building.
Be Well Baytown is led by the University of Texas MD Anderson Comprehensive cancer center and is centered around a community coalition (Steering Committee) based in Baytown, Texas.
The program aimed to implement evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to address modifiable risk factors for cancer through local Collaborating Organizations.
EBI implementation, investments in capacity building (ie, technical assistance, program evaluation, sustainability planning, etc.
), Steering Committee member partnerships, and overall reach of the initiative were assessed.
Eight Collaborating Organizations across 6 sectors received more than 3500 capacity building hours to plan and deliver EBIs in the community between 2018 and 2024.
The initiative sustained reach over the first 7 years of implementation with 93% of the city population reached in 2024.
Partnerships between organizations increased over time with Steering Committee members (n = 17) reporting an average of 14.1 partners in 2024.
Whole-community interventions require initial and sustained buy-in across multiple sectors.
The experience of the program over 7 years demonstrates the potential for whole-community interventions that prioritize cross-sectoral collaboration and local capacity building.
