SKV-012 is a novel engineered oncolytic virus (containing the viral neurovirulence ICP34.5 gene transcribed by the Survivin promoter with an upstream genetic component of interleukin-12 (IL-12) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter) that preferentially replicates in tumors and helps stimulate antitumor immune responses.
