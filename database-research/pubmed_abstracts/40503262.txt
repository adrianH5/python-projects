Mediastinal diseases in HIV patients show complex diagnostic challenges due to opportunistic infections and rare neoplasms.
While Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a key technique, its effectiveness is limited as it only provides cytological samples.
Endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal cryobiopsy (CryoEBUS) emerges as a promising alternative, yielding larger and higher-quality samples.
This study, the first in Mexico and the first worldwide in HIV patients, evaluates its diagnostic efficacy compared to EBUS-TBNA, highlighting its potential to improve disease management in immunocompromised populations.
