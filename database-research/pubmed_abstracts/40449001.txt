Here, we present a computational protocol for predicting repressors of cancer cell death by combining vulnerability and transcriptomic responses to cell death inducers.
We describe steps for calculating a set of predictors for each gene and aggregating them into a single metric, ranking the genes according to their predictive power.
We then detail procedures for selecting candidate genes for experimental validation based on this ranking and other considerations.
This protocol enables the identification of several experimentally validated cell death repressors.
For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Vinik et al.
