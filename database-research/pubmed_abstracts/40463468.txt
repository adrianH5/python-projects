Unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking, can impact oxidative stress.
During oxidative stress, unnaturalized free radicals can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to cellular damage and death.
A comprehensive measurement of various pro-oxidative and antioxidative exposures can reflect an individual's oxidative stress burden.
However, studies on assessing the association between dietary and lifestyle factors related to oxidative stress and menopause were previously lacking.
