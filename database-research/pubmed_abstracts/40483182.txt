Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are severe complications of surgery and other invasive procedures.
However, the underlying mechanisms by which general anaesthetics contribute to PND remain largely unknown.
Based on our findings of a link between hyperhomocysteinaemia and increased risk of PND, we investigated functional alterations in cystathionine-Î²-synthase (CBS) and its role in memory function after general anaesthesia.
