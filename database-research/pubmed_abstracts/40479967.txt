Research by Sutin et al.
[16] shows a significant relationship between the meaning of life and reduced risk of mortality from various causes, including cancer, respiratory diseases, and COVID-19.
Based on data from the UK Biobank, individuals with higher levels of meaning in life have a 15Â % lower risk of death, even after accounting for social-demographic factors, clinical conditions, and health behaviors.
Interestingly, this relationship remains strong even in the presence of depression, suggesting that meaning in life offers benefits to individuals with psychological disorders.
It would be interesting and important to explore whether the findings of Sutin and colleagues can be translated into the Asian context, particularly in Indonesia.
In Indonesia, deep-rooted religious and social values, such as mutual cooperation (gotong royong) and family ties, play a crucial role in shaping the meaning of life.
In the broader Asian context, the meaning of life is influenced by spiritual teachings and cultural values, such as Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism.
These teachings emphasize the importance of a life purpose connected to wisdom, inner peace, and social harmony.
Integrating the concept of the meaning of life into public health policies in Indonesia and other ASEAN countries could be an effective approach to reducing early mortality and increasing life expectancy.
In the face of rapid population aging in the region, meaning of life can help improve psychological and physical well-being, reduce stress, and extend longevity.
Therefore, considering the meaning of life as part of public health strategies could enhance life quality and strengthen the social and psychological resilience of the community.
