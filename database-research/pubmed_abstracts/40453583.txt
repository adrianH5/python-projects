Therapeutic central neck dissection (CND) is strongly recommended for patients with clinically node-positive (cN1) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
However, the role of prophylactic central neck dissection (PCND) remains controversial for clinically node-negative (cN0) PTC, particularly in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).
To better elucidate the benefits and disadvantages, we conducted a retrospective analysis with a follow-up of more than 10 years.
