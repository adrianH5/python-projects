Radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) is considered the standard of care for patients with high-risk upper tract urothelial carcinoma.
Current literature reveals a deficit in direct comparative studies evaluating the efficacy of different chemotherapeutic agents administered in single postoperative instillation following RNU.
The primary aim of this study was to compare the bladder recurrence (BR) rates between patients receiving a single instillation of mitomycin C (MMC) versus gemcitabine (Gem) after RNU.
