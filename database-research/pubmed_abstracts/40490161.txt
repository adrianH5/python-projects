Post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) is a serious complication of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) associated with development of CKD, prolonged hospital stay, and perioperative mortality.
Iodinated contrast is a known risk factor for PC-AKI but is a technical necessity for EVAR.
The optimal volume of contrast necessary to minimize risk of PC-AKI in a patient undergoing elective EVAR is unknown.
This study examines the incidence and significance of PC-AKI after EVAR and derives a patient-specific model to determine the optimal volume of contrast the surgeon should administer to mitigate the risk of PC-AKI.
