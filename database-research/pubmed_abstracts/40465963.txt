Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies among men globally.
Early and accurate assessment of tumor aggressiveness is essential for guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes.
With growing clinical interest in combining optical, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging approaches for cancer detection, we systematically investigated the cellular uptake of three multimodal contrast agents─indocyanine green (ICG), ICG-loaded nanobubbles (ICG-NBs), and ICG-loaded microbubbles (ICG-MBs)─across prostate cancer cell lines with varying aggressiveness (PC-3M > PC-3 > DU-145 > LNCaP).
Concentration- and time-dependent assays revealed that after 1 h of incubation, ICG-NBs exhibited 5-fold higher uptake (***
