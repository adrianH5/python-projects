Developing a generic sensitive platform for detecting diverse biomarkers is essential for a comprehensive understanding of disease states, guiding precision medicine.
Herein, we introduce a versatile platform based on glass fiber interfaced CRISPR/Cas with a universal reagent setting (g-CURS), which used a fixed pair of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) activator to enable detection of multiple nucleic acids or proteins with ultrahigh sensitivity.
The fixed ssDNA activator was labeled on multiple specific ligation products or detection antibodies conjugated on glass fiber to initiate CRISPR/Cas12a-assisted rapid and exponential cascade amplification through circular reporters (CRs), generating fluorescence signals readable by a portable detector.
g-CURS was able to detect viral nucleic acids with attomolar sensitivity within 30 min and multiple low-abundance proteins in extracellular vesicles of Parkinson's disease (PD) serum with subpicomolar sensitivity within 80 min.
g-CURS simplifies CRISPR/Cas biosensing using a standard reagent setting, holding promise for biomarker discovery free from bulky instruments.
