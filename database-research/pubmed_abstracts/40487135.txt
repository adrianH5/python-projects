Venous leg ulceration (VLU) is the most severe form of venous disease and an important burden to patients and society.
Many treatments for VLU exist, including wound therapies, medications, and surgical interventions.
However, high-level randomized trial data supporting leg ulcer treatments are lacking, limiting their adoption in clinical practice.
We developed a platform trial assessing multiple interventions for VLU comprising multiple multi-arm multi-stage trials.
