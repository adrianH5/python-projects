While adult anthropometric measures are well-studied in relation to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, the impact of early-life anthropometry remains unclear.
We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis examining early-life anthropometry, including birth size, height and adiposity and adult CRC risk.
We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and CENTRAL.
Early-life stages were categorised as at birth, infancy (0 to <2 years), childhood (2 to 9 years), adolescence (10 to 19 years) and young adulthood (18 to 25 years).
Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted when ≥3 prospective observational studies provided sufficient information; otherwise, results were descriptively synthesised.
We included 37 publications, and evidence was graded by the Global Cancer Update Programme Expert Panel.
Higher birthweight (relative risk [RR] per 1000 g: 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.16; 8 studies, 8134 cases) and young adult body mass index (BMI, RR per 5 kg/m
