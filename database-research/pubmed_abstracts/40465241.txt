Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is treated with combined chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to maximize the potential for cure.
This multimodality treatment approach can result in substantial toxicity for patients, including life-altering changes in bowel, urinary, and sexual function as well as decrements in quality of life (QOL).
We explored the lived experiences of patients and caregivers during multimodality treatment for LARC.
