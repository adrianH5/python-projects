Lymph node (LN) involvement is a negative prognostic factor for patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA).
Therefore, preoperative assessment of the LN status could potentially aid therapy decision making.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is often used to obtain a tissue diagnosis of the primary tumor, but can also be used to sample suspicious LN.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of EUS for suspicious LN in patients with presumed resectable dCCA.
