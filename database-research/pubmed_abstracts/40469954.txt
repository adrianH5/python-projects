We propose a new approach to deriving minimum standards for scientific training in medical studies.
This approach allows specific learning objectives to be clearly defined and presented, in an easily comprehensible manner.
We contend that a fundamental prerequisite for university studies is the instruction in the systematic scientific method that can be described through the scientific cycle.
This instruction provides the foundation for the acquisition of scientific knowledge and evidence-based practice in medicine.
