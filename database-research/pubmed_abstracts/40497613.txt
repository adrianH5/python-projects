This article reports on a case of hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) secondary to multiple myeloma (MM) with extramedullary lesions presenting as the initial symptom.
MM with extramedullary lesions, also referred to as Garcin-Guillain syndrome, is extremely rare, occurring in only 4.6% of MM patients.
Secondary HPS is uncommon in malignant tumors and is particularly rare in MM.
