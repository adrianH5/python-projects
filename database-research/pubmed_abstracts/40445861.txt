Antibodies against PD-1 (PD1i), such as cemiplimab and pembrolizumab, have demonstrated significant efficacy in advanced, unresectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).
These agents elicit durable responses in approximately 45% of patients, contributing to improved aesthetic, functional, and survival outcomes in a subset of individuals with advanced cSCC.
This review highlights recent and ongoing research investigating the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for cSCC in the curative intent perioperative settings, advanced/metastatic setting, and within the immunocompromised patient populations.
