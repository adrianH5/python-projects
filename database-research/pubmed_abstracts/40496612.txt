The Briganti 2019 nomogram stratifies risk of lymph node involvement (LNI) in prostate cancer, reducing unnecessary pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during radical prostatectomy (RP).
However the applicability of the nomogram in diverse populations remains under-explored, with only one external validation study performed in an Asian population to date.
We aim to evaluate the performance of the nomogram in a large tertiary Asian institution.
