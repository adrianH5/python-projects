The advent of research using drug-delivery vehicles with nanoparticles (NPs) in treating and diagnosing lung cancer has created a potential development in cancer therapeutics.
Using certain NP-based compositions, specifically hybrid NPs, the cancer cells could be detected with enhanced fluorescence ability and treated using targeted drug release while minimizing adverse effects.
A modified microwave-based synthesis approach was used in this study to synthesize spherical core-shell hybrid cobalt oxide carbon nanodot (Co
