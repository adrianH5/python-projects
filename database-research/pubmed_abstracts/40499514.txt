Evolutionary medicine integrates principles of evolutionary biology to understand and treat human diseases.
As a classical example, positive selection of the sickle hemoglobin mutation, which confers a survival advantage against malaria in heterozygous individuals, causes sickle cell disease in homozygotes.
In this issue of Immunity, Zilong Zhao et al.
report a possible additional evolutionary trade-off associated with sickle hemoglobin: compromised anti-tumor immunity.
