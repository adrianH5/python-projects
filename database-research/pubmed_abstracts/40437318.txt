Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterised by skin and nervous system anomalies, primarily involving glial cells and nerve tumours.
Pain, particularly chronic pain, is a significant but often overlooked symptom in NF1 patients, affecting their health-related quality of life.
The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is essential for pain signal transmission, yet in vivo studies of DRG in NF1 patients are lacking.
