Sebaceous lymphadenoma is a rare benign tumor of the salivary glands, with fewer than 50 cases reported worldwide.
Its clinical and radiological resemblance to malignant tumors poses diagnostic challenges.
A 35-year-old female presented with a slow-growing, painless left parotid mass persisting for 2 years.
Ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed, hypoechoic nodule measuring 2.5 cm.
Fine-needle aspiration cytology suggested a benign lymphoid lesion, but definitive diagnosis required histopathological examination post-superficial parotidectomy.
Microscopic analysis showed proliferating sebaceous cells within lymphoid stroma, confirmed by immunohistochemistry (EMA+, CK7-).
No recurrence was observed at 12-month follow-up.
This case underscores the importance of histopathology in distinguishing sebaceous lymphadenoma from carcinomas (e.g.
sebaceous carcinoma) or Warthin tumor, particularly in regions with limited molecular diagnostic resources.
Despite its rarity, sebaceous lymphadenoma should be considered in differential diagnoses of parotid masses to avoid unnecessary aggressive treatments.
