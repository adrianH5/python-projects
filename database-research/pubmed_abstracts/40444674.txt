Tumor microenvironment (TME) alteration can lead to tumorigenesis, where tumors evade the immune system and spread.
Thus, immunomodulation inside the TME may be a useful therapeutic approach.
In this regard, bioprinting has become a potential technique for developing therapeutic solutions that offer improved control over immune modulation.
Through the use of novel immune cell therapies and realistic tumor models, it provides a platform for advancing cancer immunotherapy.
By examining the complex mechanisms of immunomodulation in tumorigenesis, this review article clarifies how interactions between the immune system and the tumor microenvironment affect the initiation and spread of cancer.
Additionally, the effectiveness of 3D bioprinting in modulating and activating immune cells, such as T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, has also been analyzed.
A summary of current research shows the pivotal role of 3D bioprinting in establishing a solid foundation for advancing anticancer studies and revolutionizing cancer treatment through immunotherapeutic strategies.
