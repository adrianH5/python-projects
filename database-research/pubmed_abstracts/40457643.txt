Developing promising biodegradable second near-infrared (NIR-II) immune agonists to overcome the insufficient immunogenicity of tumor cells and the poor immune response remains challenging.
In this work, a biodegradable "2D genesheet" is explored for synergistic NIR-II photothermal immunotherapy.
The 2D genesheet is large-scale prepared through flexible supramolecular self-assembly between metallic-MoS
