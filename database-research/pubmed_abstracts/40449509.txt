Bexmarilimab blocks Clever-1 on macrophages to enhance antigen presentation and T cell activation.
Because Clever-1 is expressed by myeloid leukaemia cells, bexmarilimab may combat leukaemia and influence the tumour microenvironment to augment the effectiveness of standard-of-care therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia.
The aim of this study was to determine the safety of bexmarilimab in combination with standard-of-care treatment in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia and to identify the recommended dose for expansion of bexmarilimab in combination with standard of care.
