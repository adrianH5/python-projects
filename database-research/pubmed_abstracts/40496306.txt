Visceral crisis (VC) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is defined as a severe organ dysfunction related to metastatic disease.
The cornerstone of treatment for VC relies on polychemotherapy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it often represents the only available therapeutic option.
This study aims to assess survival outcomes of palliative chemotherapy (CT) for VC in a real-world scenario.
