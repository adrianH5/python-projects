Direct comparisons between nab-paclitaxel and solvent-based taxanes are scarce, with inconsistent results from mostly retrospective studies.
High-level evidence comparing their efficacy in HER2-positive breast cancer remains lacking.
Our study represents the first systematic review and meta-analysis to directly compare the long-term and short-term efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel versus solvent-based paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.
