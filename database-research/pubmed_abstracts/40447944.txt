Seronegative myasthenia gravis (MG) accounts for ~ 10% of MG cases, often with mild to moderate symptoms.
Diagnosis is frequently delayed or incorrect.
Advanced serological, neurophysiological, and objective testing is essential to differentiate MG from similar conditions, avoid misdiagnosis, and ensure appropriate care.
