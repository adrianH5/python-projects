Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant global health challenge, leading to chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the clearance of HBV-infected cells, but their efficacy is often compromised during chronic infection.
Adaptive NK cells, characterised by NKG2C expression and enhanced functional responses, represent a promising therapeutic avenue for enhancing anti-HBV immunity and responses to HBV-driven cancers.
