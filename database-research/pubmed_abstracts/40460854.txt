This study aimed to investigate the correlation between cortisol secretion and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension in patients with adrenal tumors.
A total of 164 patients with benign adrenal tumors were recruited between January 2019 and December 2024.
Cortisol levels were assessed using a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, classifying patients into three groups: non-functional adrenal tumors (group A, n=73), minimal autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS, group B, n=64), and MACS with confirmed Cushing's syndrome (group C, n=27).
Statistical analyses compared the prevalence of hypertension and T2D across groups.
Cortisol concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ELISA.
Logistic regression identified factors influencing hypertension and T2D.
The prevalence of hypertension and T2D was significantly higher in group C compared to groups A and B (p<0.05).
Cortisol concentrations were higher in groups C and B than in group A (p<0.05), with group C showing the highest levels.
Elevated cortisol in MACS patients was associated with increased hypertension risk (p<0.05) and higher rates of T2D (p<0.05).
Age was a significant predictor, with a 9% increase in risk for each additional year.
Cortisol secretion in adrenal tumor patients is linked to T2D and hypertension.
As cortisol levels and age increase, so does the risk of these conditions, highlighting cortisol as a potential biomarker for managing these comorbidities.
