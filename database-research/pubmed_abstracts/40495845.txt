Uncertainty in illness (UI) and fear of progression (FoP) are significant psychological challenges for lung cancer patients.
Coping styles and social support are critical mediators, influencing patients' ability to manage the emotional and psychological burden of UI and FoP.
However, limited research has explored the chain mediation effect of these factors on the relationship between UI and FoP, particularly among Chinese lung cancer patients.
