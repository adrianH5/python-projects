Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
Endovascular treatment (EVT) is recognized as an effective intervention for acute ischemic stroke, but only a small fraction of patients with large vessel occlusion receive it.
While EVT adoption has grown in the U.S., data on short- and long-term outcomes remain limited.
This study aims to assess trends and in-hospital outcomes of stroke patients undergoing EVT.
