Globally, the occurrence of osteoarthritis (OA) is increasing, and the intensity of the condition is frequently determined by the level of inflammation and nutritional status in a person.
The Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI), a pioneering metric, merges two pivotal elements.
For instance, it integrates markers of inflammation with measures of nutritional status.
This research seeks to delineate the link between ALI and the risk of mortality, whether from universal causes or cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly in the OA-affected population.
