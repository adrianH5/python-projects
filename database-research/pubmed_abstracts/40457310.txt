Colorectal cancer (CRC) has emerged as a global health concern, as evidenced by its position as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality.
This underscores the necessity for effective disease management strategies.
The present study aims to assess the impact of chitosan nanoparticles (CSNP) conjugated with the Lactobacillus acidophilus secretome (CSNP/L.a-sup), on the signaling pathways associated with CRC.
