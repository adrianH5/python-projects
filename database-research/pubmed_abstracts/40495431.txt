Preclinical animal research plays a crucial role in studying colorectal cancer (CRC).
Mouse models allow for testing the efficacy of potential medications and understanding the mechanisms behind CRC development.
Carcinogens like 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and Azoxymethane (AOM) are used to induce CRC in these models, enabling researchers to investigate various treatment approaches.
The availability of diverse animal strains facilitates the study of CRC progression and metastasis.
By examining literature on animal models, researchers can assess the accuracy of reproducing different stages of CRC, from crypts to polyps and tumors.
Animal models are essential for studying the tumor microenvironment and its impact on CRC.
These models replicate key features of human CRC, including angiogenesis and immune responses.
Both immunocompetent and immunocompromised rodents are used to evaluate immunotherapeutic drugs.
This review summarizes common murine models for CRC and their applications in translational research.
Future trends in this field likely include further advancements in animal models for studying tumor biology.
