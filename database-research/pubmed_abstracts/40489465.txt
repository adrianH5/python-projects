Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a diverse collection of malignant tumors that originate in the bile ducts.
Mitochondria, the energy converters in eukaryotic cells, contain circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which has a greater mutation rate than nuclear DNA.
Heteroplasmic variations in mtDNA may suggest an increased risk of cancer-related mortality, serving as a potential prognostic marker.
In this study, we investigated the mtDNA variations of five CCA cell lines, including KKU-023, KKU-055, KKU-100, KKU213A, and KKU-452 and compared them to the non-tumor cholangiocyte MMNK-1 cell line.
We used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a long-read sequencing technology capable of synthesizing the whole mitochondrial genome, which facilitates enhanced identification of complicated rearrangements in mitogenomics.
The analysis revealed a high frequency of SNVs and INDELs, particularly in the D-loop, MT-RNR2, MT-CO1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND5 genes.
Significant mutations were detected in all CCA cell lines, with particularly notable non-synonymous SNVs such as m.8462T > C in KKU-023, m.9493G > A in KKU-055, m.9172C > A in KKU-100, m.15024G > C in KKU-213A, m.12994G > A in KKU-452, and m.13406G > A in MMNK-1, which demonstrated high pathogenicity scores.
The presence of these mutations suggests the potential for mitochondrial dysfunction and CCA progression.
Analysis of mtDNA structural variants (SV) revealed significant variability among the cell lines.
We identified 208 SVs in KKU-023, 185 SVs in KKU-055, 231 SVs in KKU-100, 69 SVs in KKU-213A, 172 SVs in KKU-452, and 217 SVs in MMNK-1.
These SVs included deletions, duplications, and inversions, with the highest variability observed in KKU-100 and the lowest in KKU-213A.
Our results underscore the diverse mtDNA mutation landscape in CCA cell lines, highlighting the potential impact of these mutations on mitochondrial function and CCA cell line progression.
Future research is required to investigate the functional impacts of these variants, their interactions with nuclear DNA in CCA, and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.
