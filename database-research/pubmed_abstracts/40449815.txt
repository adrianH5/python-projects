Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are recognized as key drivers of tumor recurrence and therapy resistance due to their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation.
Amino acid metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark of cancer, underpins CSC biology.
Methionine, tryptophan, and glutamine support CSC survival and the maintenance of stemness, while proline plays a role in CSC differentiation and susceptibility to cell death.
Consequently, the impact of amino acid metabolism on CSCs is multifaceted and complex.
This review first outlines the intrinsic amino acid metabolic features of CSCs.
It then provides a comprehensive analysis of the distinct roles of various amino acids in regulating CSC biology.
Additionally, strategies targeting amino acid metabolism to eliminate CSCs in clinical therapies are discussed, offering new perspectives for the development of innovative tumor-targeting approaches.
