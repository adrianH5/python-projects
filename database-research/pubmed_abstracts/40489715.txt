Juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMG) is a rare disorder defined as MG in patients younger than 18 years.
Generalized JMG is more common in postpubertal than prepubertal patients.
There are no formal international JMG treatment guidelines, and knowledge on treatment patterns and disease burden is limited.
The aim of this study was to describe treatment patterns and health care resource utilization (HCRU) for patients with JMG and explore differences in disease presentation between prepubertal-onset (younger than 12 years) and postpubertal-onset (12-17 years) patients.
