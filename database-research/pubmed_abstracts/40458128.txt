Internal hernia is a critical complication after laparoscopic gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y, Billroth-II or double tract reconstruction.
It is recommended that mesenteric defects should be closed to prevent internal hernias.
We reported two patients who developed internal hernias, in which the afferent loop of Billroth-II reconstruction became incarcerated into the closed mesenteric defects.
