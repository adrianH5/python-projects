Carinal resection is a rare and demanding surgical procedure indicated for radical treatment of lung cancer and airway tumors invading the tracheo-bronchial bifurcation.
This operation includes different techniques for airway reconstruction which can be associated or not with lung resection depending on the tumor extension.
Rigorous patient selection, use of complementary therapy, increased experience in surgical technique and progress in intra- and post-operative management have allowed to improve short and long-term results over time.
Because of the high perioperative risks, this type of surgery is primarily performed in specialized high-volume centers with expertise in airway reconstruction.
