Development of safe and effective subunit vaccines for controlling African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) infection has been hampered by a lack of protective viral antigens, complex virion structures, and multiple mechanisms of infection.
Here, we selected ASFV antigens based on their localization on the virion, known functions, and homologies to the subunits of the protective vaccinia virus vaccine.
We also engineered viral capsid proteins for inducing optimal antibody responses and designed T cell-directed antigens for inducing broad and robust cellular immunity.
The selected antigens in lipid nanoparticle-mRNA formulations were evaluated for immunogenicity in both mice and pigs with concordant results.
Different antigens induced divergent immune response profiles, including the levels of IgG and T cell responses and effector functions of antisera.
We further developed a computational approach to combine antigens into cocktails for inducing specific immune response profiles and to validate candidate cocktail vaccines in mice.
Our results provide a basis for further evaluation of candidate subunit mRNA vaccines in challenge studies.
