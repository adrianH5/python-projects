Phage display has emerged as a groundbreaking technique for discovering novel biomolecules with significant applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy.
This technique employs genetically engineered bacteriophages to display diverse libraries of peptides on their coat proteins, enabling the identification of candidates through a biopanning process targeting specific cancer markers.
Biomolecules identified via phage display are widely used as molecular tools, often labeled with imaging agents or conjugated to nanoparticles for noninvasive tumor imaging.
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in phage display applications in cancer research over the past 5â€‰years and prominent examples of clinical studies.
The analysis underscores the potential of phage display to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic biomolecules, highlighting its promise for future clinical implementation in cancer imaging.
