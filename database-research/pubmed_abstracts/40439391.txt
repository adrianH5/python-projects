Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality, with limited treatment options in advanced stages.
Eribulin is now recommended for MBC and covered by the Indonesian National Health Insurance Policy as monotherapy for 6 cycles.
However, data on its effectiveness and safety in Indonesian patients remain scarce.
This study aimed to evaluate the disease control rate, overall survival (OS), and adverse events of eribulin monotherapy after 6 treatment cycles in Indonesian MBC patients.
