We investigated the role of tripartite motif 47 (TRIM47) in paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer, focusing on its regulation of protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway activation, and methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification.
