Breast cancer associated gene 1 (BRCA1) mutation and consequential reduction in transcription cause cancer, predominantly in the breast and ovarian tissues.
However, its noncancer-related functions in ovarian tissues remain largely unknown.
Here, we report BRCA1 is strongly involved in sow granulosa cell (sGC) apoptosis and cycle, and is targeted and inhibited by the pro-apoptotic miR-1307.
BRCA1 is highly abundant in sGCs, and up-regulated during sow follicular development, but weakly expressed in atretic follicles, indicating a close correlation with sow follicular development and atresia.
A loss-of-function assay showed that BRCA1 suppresses sGC apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression.
Furthermore, miR-1307 is a pro-apoptotic factor that inhibits BRCA1 by targeting the 3'UTR of the latter.
In addition, the miR-1307 and BRCA1 axis can be activated by oxidative stress (OS), which is related to the transcriptional activation of miR-1307 by FoxO3, a transcription factor activated by OS.
In conclusion, this study provides a basis for understanding the role of BRCA1 in sow reproduction and a theoretical target for improving sow fertility.
