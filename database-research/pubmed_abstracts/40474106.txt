Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality.
While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as promising therapies, their efficacy is hindered by the lack of robust patient-centric biomarkers.
Obesity, traditionally linked to cancer risk, paradoxically correlates with improved immunotherapy responses in some cancers, termed the "obesity paradox".
However, traditional measurements like body mass index (BMI) may not fully capture metabolic-immune interactions.
This study evaluates the predictive significance of lipid accumulation product (LAP) and visceral adiposity index (VAI), two metabolic indices, in gastric cancer patients receiving programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitors.
