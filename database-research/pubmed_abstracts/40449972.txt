Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer and a leading cause of death from skin tumors.
With the rising incidence of melanoma diagnoses, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments.
Among the most modern approaches are cancer vaccines, which aim to enhance cell-mediated immunity.
Recently, mRNA-based cancer vaccines have gained significant attention due to their rapid production, low manufacturing costs, and ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses.
These vaccines hold great potential in melanoma treatment, yet their application faces several challenges, including mRNA stabilization, delivery methods, and tumor heterogeneity.
The recent success of mRNA vaccines in combating COVID-19 has renewed interest in their potential for cancer immunotherapy.
In particular, mRNA cancer vaccines offer high specificity and better efficacy compared to traditional treatments.
They can target tumor-specific neoantigens, prompting a robust immune response.
This chapter reviews the mechanism of action of mRNA vaccines, advancements in adjuvant identification, and innovations in delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles.
It also discusses ongoing clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines in melanoma, highlighting promising early-phase results.
Despite their potential, the development of mRNA cancer vaccines faces significant obstacles.
Tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and practical issues like vaccine administration and clinical evaluation methods are major barriers to success.
By addressing these challenges and advancing innovations, mRNA cancer vaccines hold promise for transforming melanoma treatment.
A careful balance between the opportunities and challenges will be key to unlocking the full potential of mRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy.
