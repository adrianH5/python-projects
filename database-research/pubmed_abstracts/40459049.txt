The DNAJ/HSP40 family consists of three distinct subfamilies (DNAJA, DNAJB, and DNAJC) and is the largest and most diverse co-chaperone proteins for HSP70.
The DNAJA subfamily, comprising four members, assumes a pivotal role in various pathological conditions such as cystic fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer.
This review comprehensively investigates the participation and underlying mechanisms of DNAJA proteins in tumor proliferation and metastasis, with a specific focus on their influence on the accumulation of mutant p53 proteins.
Furthermore, we conducted an extensive examination of compounds utilizing computer-based techniques that specifically target DNAJA or its associated pathways, thereby offering novel insights for the development of cutting-edge combination therapies in the realm of cancer treatment.
Our findings highlight the potential significance of targeting the DNAJA subfamily as a promising approach for anti-tumor therapy.
Simultaneously, we also highlighted the limitations of current DNAJA research and proposed future directions for advancement in this field.
We anticipate that DNAJA will emerge as a novel therapeutic target for anti-tumor interventions.
