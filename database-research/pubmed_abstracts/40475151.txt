Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable disease with a 5-year overall survival rate below 25%.
Metastases often emerge from subclinical, disseminated tumor cells that persist despite systemic therapy of primary disease - referred to as minimal residual disease (MRD).
Detecting MRD is critical for identifying patients at high risk of recurrence and enabling timely intervention.
