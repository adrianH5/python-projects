Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that poses a serious threat to human physical and mental health.
Its main clinical features include itching, lichenification, and dry skin.
The etiology of AD is not yet fully understood, and its pathogenesis is only partially elucidated.
An increasing body of evidence suggests that this refractory disease is associated with epigenetic alterations, including specific modifications in immune cells and keratinocytes that play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD.
The latest advances in epigenetic research have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of AD and potential therapeutic targets.
In this review, we discuss the impact of DNA methylation, noncoding RNAs, and histone modifications on the pathogenesis of AD, emphasizing the potential of epigenetic modifications as targeted biomarkers, which pave the way for the development of novel targeted therapies and personalized medical approaches.
