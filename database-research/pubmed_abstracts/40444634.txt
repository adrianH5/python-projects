Bacteria take up environmental DNA using dynamic appendages called type IV pili (T4P) to elicit horizontal gene transfer in a process called natural transformation.
Natural transformation is widespread amongst bacteria yet the parameters that enhance or limit this process across species are poorly understood.
We show that the most naturally transformable species known, Acinetobacter baylyi, owes this property to uniquely high levels of DNA binding by its orphan minor pilin, FimT.
Expression of A. baylyi FimT in a closely related Acinetobacter pathogen substantially improves its capacity for natural transformation, showing that the acquisition of a single gene is sufficient to increase rates of horizontal gene transfer.
We show that, compared with its homologs, A. baylyi FimT contains multiple regions of positively charged residues that additively promote DNA binding efficiency.
These results demonstrate the importance of T4P-DNA binding in establishing natural transformation rates and provide a basis for improving or limiting this mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in different species.
