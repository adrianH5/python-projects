This study aims to comprehensively assess the clinical performance of the Versius robotic platform in the context of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), focusing on its safety profile, practicality, and postoperative functional recovery, in order to support its integration into urologic cancer management.
An extensive literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, covering publications up to December 2024.
The eligible studies were those reporting on perioperative metrics or functional outcomes associated with Versius-assisted RARP.
Data extraction and synthesis were carried out under a single-arm meta-analytic framework.
The aggregated measures such as operative duration, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospitalization, complication frequency, positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, and continence outcomes were calculated using Stata 18 SE.
The study heterogeneity was quantified via the I
