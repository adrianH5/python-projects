Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, where angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in tumor metastasis.
Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is widely recognized for its role in regulating cell cycle progression and promoting tumorigenesis; however, its involvement in UM-associated angiogenesis remains largely unexplored.
Artesunate (ART), a bioactive compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, has recently garnered attention for its promising anti-cancer properties.
This study aimed to elucidate the role of AURKA in UM angiogenesis and assess the potential of ART as an effective AURKA inhibitor.
