Bladder cancer (BC) is a significant global health concern and includes non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC), which poses challenges due to recurrence and progression.
Immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG), shows promise particularly in cases of BCG failure or BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, with ICIs emerging as a potential treatment option for these challenging cases.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically compare the efficacy and safety of BCG with ICIs in NMIBC.
The present meta-analysis identifies response predictors and treatment outcomes, which can help in recognizing potential biomarkers such as tumor characteristics, hemoglobin levels and baseline performance status, associated with therapy response.
These insights may guide future research in developing personalized treatment strategies for BCG non-responsive NMIBC cases.
Following the Preferred Reporting Standards for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic literature search identified relevant studies published between January 2015 and April 2024.
Randomized controlled trials and clinical trials involving patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC were included in the primary analysis.
Data extraction and analysis were conducted using Review Manager version 5.4, employing a random effects model.
The risk of bias assessment followed the Cochrane guidelines.
The present study included 2,154 participants across 10 studies evaluating treatments for NMIBC.
Primary comparisons focused on BCG vs. ICIs: Pembrolizumab significantly improved tumor control (OR, 4.67; 95% CI, 1.43-15.25; P=0.01), progression-free survival (PFS; OR, 4.85; CI, 1.58-14.85; P=0.006), and overall survival (OS; OR, 3.61; CI, 1.28-10.19; P=0.02).
Atezolizumab similarly outperformed BCG in metastatic disease (OR, 0.19; CI, 0.06-0.59; P=0.004) and lymph node involvement (OR, 0.43; CI, 0.20-0.93; P=0.03).
ICIs exhibited a favorable safety profile vs. BCG, with fewer incidents of anemia (OR, 2.87; P=0.001) and diarrhea (OR, 1.79; P=0.03), despite higher rates of asthenia (OR, 7.33; P<0.00001) and pyrexia (OR, 3.26; P<0.00001).
Exploratory comparisons with chemotherapy revealed pembrolizumab's advantages in terms of PFS (OR, 1.36; P=0.02) and OS (OR, 1.31; P=0.005), while atezolizumab improved metastatic control (OR, 0.54; P=0.0008).
Heterogeneity was low for BCG comparisons (I
