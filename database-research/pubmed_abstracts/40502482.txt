Gastric cancer predominantly affects the elderly, who face significant challenges due to high postoperative complications and stress.
These challenges include comorbidities, reduced physiological reserves, and increased risks of infections and delayed healing.
Traditional postoperative care often falls short in addressing these issues effectively.
Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) principles have revolutionized surgical care by reducing stress and promoting recovery through a holistic approach.
ERAS emphasizes preoperative optimization, intraoperative care, and postoperative rehabilitation tailored to patient needs.
Despite its recognized benefits, the impact of continuity nursing care within the ERAS framework on elderly gastric cancer patients remains underexplored.
This study examines the influence of ERAS-based continuity nursing care on postoperative satisfaction, inflammation, stress, and quality of life in elderly patients undergoing gastric cancer resection.
