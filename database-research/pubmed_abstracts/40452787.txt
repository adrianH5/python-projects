Small interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a new method for anti-tumor therapy by targeting Survivin gene in liver cancer.
However, free Survivin siRNA is easily degraded and cleared by endonucleases or macrophages in the blood circulation.
Therefore, it is urgent to construct a safe and efficient delivery system to achieve effective transfection of Survivin siRNA.
