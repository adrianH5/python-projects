Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a global health challenge, causing severe morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable groups such as the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and those with comorbidities.
In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), vaccine access is hindered by high costs and inequitable distribution.
To tackle these issues, Mexico developed the AVX/COVID-12 (V-Wu) vaccine, a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based platform expressing a stabilized ancestral Wuhan spike protein (HexaPro-S).
Locally manufactured after rigorous testing and regulatory approval, V-Wu aims to enhance self-sufficiency and equity in immunization.
