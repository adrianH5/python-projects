Malaria is a vector-borne parasitic disease that affects millions worldwide.
To achieve the objective set by the World Health Organization of reducing malaria cases by 2030, antimalarial drugs with novel modes of action are required.
Previously, a novel mechanism of action of chloroquine (CQ) was reported involving features of programmed cell death in the parasite, mainly characterized by calcium efflux from digestive vacuole permeabilization.
Increased intracellular calcium induces suicidal death of erythrocytes, a process known as eryptosis.
This study aimed to identify the hallmarks of eryptosis due to calcium redistribution and examine the downstream cellular effects during CQ treatment in infected red blood cells (iRBCs).
