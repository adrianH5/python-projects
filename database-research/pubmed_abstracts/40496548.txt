Tumefactive demyelinating lesions and brain neoplasms often present as a diagnostic challenge due to overlapping radiographic features among conventional imaging modalities ultimately resulting in uncertainty if a biopsy is warranted to establish a definitive diagnosis.
Synthetic MRI (SyMRI) is a novel imaging technique providing myelin maps to aid with diagnosis, yet its use in pediatric patients remains largely unexplored.
Therein, we report a pediatric case utilizing SyMRI to assist in differentiating tumefactive demyelination from a recurrent glioma.
This 16-year-old female with a history of ganglioglioma, presented with sudden left-sided weakness.
The initial MRI suggested either a glial neoplasm or a demyelinating lesion, prompting consideration of a biopsy.
SyMRI revealed a unique "rim of decreased myelination," challenging the initial diagnosis.
Within 1â€‰week from admission, the patient's symptoms resolved without recurrence.
Immunotherapy resolved the demyelinating lesion, supporting the initial SyMRI finding.
The case demonstrates the potential of SyMRI in pediatric neuroradiology, highlighting a distinct "rim of demyelination" and its comparison to gliomas aiding in the diagnostic process.
