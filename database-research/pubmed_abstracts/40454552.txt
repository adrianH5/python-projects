This study explored the effectiveness of combining the production-oriented approach (POA) with the Plan-Do-Check-Action (PDCA) cycle in clinical teaching of gynaecologic oncology.
A total of 60 rotating physicians, undergoing standardized training in First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University between January 2023 and March 2024, were randomly divided into an experimental group (n=30) and a control group (n=30).
The control group followed traditional teaching methods, while the experimental group received teaching based on the POA and PDCA cycle.
Comparison of pre- and post-teaching scores revealed that the experimental group had significantly higher scores in theoretical examinations, practical operations, and case analysis (P<0.05).
Additionally, the experimental group demonstrated greater enthusiasm for learning and stronger autonomous learning abilities (P<0.05).
Furthermore, teaching satisfaction was notably higher in the experimental group (P<0.05).
These findings suggest that integrating POA with the PDCA cycle can significantly enhance the quality of clinical teaching, improve learning outcomes, and increase satisfaction among gynaecologic oncology physicians.
