Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer deaths in the UK.
Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with delayed diagnoses and poorer CRC outcomes.
Community pharmacies, highly accessible in underserved areas, present an opportunity to address these health inequalities.
This DETECT-CRC study aimed to develop a pharmacy-based active case-finding (ACF) service for CRC in underserved communities of Yorkshire, UK.
