Low immunogenicity, insufficient immune infiltrates, and inhibitive microenvironment of tumors ruthlessly weakened the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapies.
How to improve the therapy efficacy by reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment still remains a challenge that needs to be urgently addressed.
Here, a novel dual-defect nitrogen-rich carbon nitride-based heterostructural nanocatalyst (CNO@CuMS) possessing brilliant piezocatalytic H
