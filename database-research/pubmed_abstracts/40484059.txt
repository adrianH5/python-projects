Resection of vascular-encasing tumors has been associated with high morbidity and mortality.
However, advances in surgical techniques and cancer treatments have improved outcomes for patients undergoing resection with vascular reconstruction.
In specialized centers, cryopreserved arterial allografts (CAAs) are increasingly used when autologous conduits are unavailable, offering superior anatomical compliance and resistance to infection compared to prosthetic conduits.
This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of CAAs as a conduit for vascular reconstruction during major oncological surgery.
