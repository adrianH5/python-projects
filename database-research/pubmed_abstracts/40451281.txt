Breast cancer (BC) during pregnancy (PrBC) and the postpartum period (PPBC) often exhibits more aggressive tumour characteristics and is associated with a poorer prognosis compared with age-matched nonpregnant patients with BC.
The underlying mechanisms for this increased aggressiveness remain unresolved.
Intratumoral hypoxia, a known adverse prognostic marker in nonpregnant BC, has not yet been studied in PrBC/PPBC.
This is particularly intriguing due to the potential exposure to angiogenesis-stimulating factors during pregnancy, which may influence tumour behaviour.
