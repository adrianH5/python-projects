Hemophilia A (HA) is a hereditary X-linked hemorrhagic disorder.
Following the first treatment with exogenous factor (F)VIII, one-third of patients with severe HA develop anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors), which render treatment ineffective.
Recent findings underlined the critical role of DNA methylation in several autoimmune diseases by altering gene expression profiles.
This study was designed to evaluate potential differences in DNA methylation profiles of previously untreated patients (PUPs) who develop inhibitors against FVIII and those who do not, with the aim of identifying immune-regulatory genes that may contribute to the risk of inhibitor formation.
