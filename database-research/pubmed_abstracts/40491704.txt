Moringa sprouts are a good dietary source of glucosinolates and isothiocyanates with various health benefits, including anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties.
In this research, germinated (GMSF) or ungerminated moringa seed flour (UMSF) was incorporated into traditional staple foods to develop novel functional foods using dry noodles as a case study.
The results demonstrated that GMSF addition significantly increased the pasting temperature (by 5.15 %) and peak time (by 20.98 %) of the flour blends relative to the ungerminated counterpart (
