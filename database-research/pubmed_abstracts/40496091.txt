Anomalous pancreatobiliary junction (APBJ) is a rare congenital malformation characterized by the abnormal union of the pancreatic and bile ducts outside the duodenal wall, leading to a long common channel and predisposition to complications such as cholestasis, pancreatitis, and biliary tract cancers.
We report the case of a 3-year-old child presenting with cholestatic jaundice and abnormal liver function tests.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis by demonstrating the congenital anomaly of the biliopancreatic junction.
This case highlights the essential role of MRI in the non-invasive confirmation and evaluation of such malformations.
