Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes multiple types of cancer, and demographic-based inequities in HPV-related cancers persist.
Behavioral interventions have increased HPV vaccination uptake, yet it is unclear how intervention effects vary by demographics.
The purpose of this study was to examine whether existing HPV vaccine interventions for adolescents have unequal effects on HPV vaccine uptake.
