Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening can reduce mortality in high-risk individuals, but many individuals with a heavy smoking history may be reluctant to undergo radiologic examinations.
A non-invasive blood test might help overcome this barrier.
The BioMILD trial evaluated the combination of a plasma microRNA signature classifier (MSC) and LDCT for personalized lung cancer screening in 4,119 individuals who smoke or used to smoke.
Based on BioMILD results, we aim to conduct a projection analysis to estimate the number of early lung cancers that could be detected if MSC were used as an initial screening tool for individuals reluctant to undergo LDCT.
This model explores the potential of a biomarker-driven approach to address screening hesitation.
