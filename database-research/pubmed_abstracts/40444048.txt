Frizzled class receptor 2 (FZD2), is a critical protein in the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays significant roles in various cancers.
However, its role in cancer progression, prognosis, and diagnosis remains largely unexplored.
This study investigates the correlation between FZD2 expression and clinical outcomes, as well as its underlying molecular mechanisms in pan-cancer.
