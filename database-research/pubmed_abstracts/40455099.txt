The EF14 clinical trial reported an improvement in median overall survival (OS) from 16.0 months to 20.9 months in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who received treatment with tumor treating fields (TTFs).
This study evaluates overall survival in a large population-based cohort of patients with GBM before and after FDA approval of TTFs in 2015.
