Oral leukoplakia is a white plaque with an increased risk of malignant transformation.
Despite available treatment options such as active surveillance, surgical excision, laser ablation, and topical or systemic therapies, there is still a risk of recurrence and malignant transformation.
We reviewed all randomized controlled trials on oral leukoplakia published in PubMed from 2014 to 2024 (n = 7) to identify emerging treatment strategies.
These studies assessed the efficacy of topical Moringa oleifera, curcumin, beta-carotene with vitamin C, scalpel excision, carbon dioxide and diode laser ablation, and photodynamic therapy in the treatment of oral leukoplakia.
Some interventions showed reductions in lesion size or short-term recurrence, but none proved effective in preventing long-term recurrence or malignant transformation.
Data remain limited, and further rigorously designed, large randomized controlled trials are needed to guide potential new management approaches for oral leukoplakia.
