Radiotherapy (RT), a cornerstone of cancer treatment, exerts its therapeutic effects primarily by inducing DNA damage in tumor cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).
Despite its efficacy, RT is often counteracted by tumor-intrinsic mechanisms, such as DNA damage repair, as well as immune-suppressive responses.
YTHDF proteins, key N6-methyladenosine (m6A) readers, have emerged as pivotal regulators of tumor progression, DNA repair, and immune cell function, making them promising targets for enhancing RT efficacy.
In this review, we explore the dual roles of YTHDF proteins in modulating both tumor-intrinsic and immune-mediated responses to RT.
We summarize their influence on DNA damage repair pathways in tumor cells and their impact on the TIME, which collectively shape the antitumor efficacy of RT.
Furthermore, we discuss recent advances in the development of YTHDF-targeting inhibitors and their potential to synergize with RT and immunotherapy, offering new avenues to improve cancer treatment outcomes.
