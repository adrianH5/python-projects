A series of new Ag(i) and Cd(ii) hydrozanomide-based complexes have been prepared and studied.
The synthesized compounds have undergone extensive spectroscopic and structural characterization, including F-AAS, FTIR, single crystal XRD and TGA analyses.
Crystal structures of two representative complexes, 4 and 6, have revealed that the silver atom in complex 4 assumes a four-coordinate geometry with two ligands.
Additionally, the stability of these complexes in DMSO has been determined using UV-vis spectroscopy.
The biological activity of these metal complexes has been assessed, focusing on their antibacterial and anticancer properties against LN-229 and U87 cell lines.
Among the tested compounds, silver-based complexes demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against a wide range of microorganisms.
Moreover, cytotoxicity studies have shown that the metal complexes exhibit higher anticancer activity compared to their parent ligands.
Notably, the Ag(i) complexes of L
