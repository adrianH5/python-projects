Introduction Serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) often exhibit similar imaging features when evaluated with a single imaging modality.
Differentiating between SCN and MCN typically necessitates the utilization of multiple imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).
Recent research indicates that artificial intelligence (AI) can effectively distinguish between SCN and MCN using single-modal imaging.
Despite these advancements, the diagnostic performance of AI has not yet reached an optimal level.
This study compares the efficacy of AI in classifying SCN and MCN using multimodal imaging versus single-modal imaging.
The objective was to assess the effectiveness of AI utilizing multimodal imaging with EUS, CT, and MRI to classify these two types of pancreatic cysts.
Methods We retrospectively gathered data from 25 patients with surgically confirmed SCN and 24 patients with surgically confirmed MCN as part of a multicenter study.
Imaging was conducted using four modalities: EUS, early-phase contrast-enhanced abdominal CT, T2-weighted MRI, and magnetic resonance pancreatography.
Four images per modality were obtained for each tumor.
Data augmentation techniques were utilized, resulting in a final dataset of 39,200 images per modality.
An AI model with ResNet was employed to categorize the cysts as SCN or MCN, incorporating clinical features and combinations of imaging modalities (single, double, triple, and all four modalities).
The classification outcomes were compared with those of five experienced gastroenterologists with over 10 years of experience.
The comparison is based on three performance metrics: sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
Results For AI utilizing a single imaging modality, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 87.0%, 92.7%, and 90.8%, respectively.
Combining two imaging modalities improved the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to 95.3%, 95.1%, and 94.9%.
With three modalities, AI achieved a sensitivity of 96.0%, a specificity of 99.0%, and an accuracy of 97.0%.
Ultimately, employing all four imaging modalities resulted in AI achieving 98.0% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 99.0% accuracy.
In contrast, experts utilizing all four modalities attained a sensitivity of 78.0%, specificity of 82.0%, and accuracy of 81.0%.
The AI models consistently outperformed the experts across all metrics.
A continuous enhancement in performance was observed with each additional imaging modality, with AI utilizing three and four modalities significantly surpassing single-modal imaging AI.
Conclusion AI utilizing multimodal imaging offers better performance compared to both single-modal imaging AI and experienced human experts in classifying SCN and MCN.
