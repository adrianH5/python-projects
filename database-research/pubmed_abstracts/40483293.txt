Patients who have undergone endovascular repair of an abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm (EVAR or TEVAR) are recommended to undergo lifelong imaging surveillance to detect endoleaks.
Gold standard imaging is by triphasic single energy computed tomography (SECT), however, dual-energy CT (DECT) can reduce radiation exposure by reducing the number of scan phases required.
The accuracy of DECT in detecting endoleaks is uncertain.
This review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of DECT for detecting endoleaks and compared radiation exposure to conventional triphasic SECT.
