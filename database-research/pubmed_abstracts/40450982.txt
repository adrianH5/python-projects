As a malignant tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis and a high mortality rate, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents significant challenges in contemporary treatment.
These challenges include drug resistance and side effects, which severely hamper the effectiveness of current therapeutic strategies.
An increasing number of herbal formulas have been utilized in antitumor therapy, owing to their cost-effectiveness, beneficial efficacy, and additional advantages.
FuZhengXiaoJi Decoction (FZXJD), a cancer-treating formula, has been successfully applied in NSCLC clinical treatment, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive.
Therefore, this paper integrated multiple analytical methods, including network pharmacology, metabolomics, biological approaches, and molecular docking to clarify how FZXJD suppresses NSCLC.
