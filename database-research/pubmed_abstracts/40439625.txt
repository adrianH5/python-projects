Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most prevalent malignancy of the endocrine system, with its incidence has been increasing worldwide in recent years.
Although it generally has a favorable prognosis, aggressive forms such as anaplastic TC are associated with high mortality rates.
Cell-microenvironment interactions largely influence the progression and metastatic behavior of TC; however, the precise mechanisms underlying these processes remain inadequately understood.
One critical factor influencing metastasis is anoikis, a form of programmed cell death triggered by the detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix.
Resistance to anoikis allows tumor cells to escape apoptosis, survive in circulation, and metastasize to distant organs.
Given its pivotal role in metastasis, anoikis resistance represents a key area of study in understanding cancer progression.
This review covers the molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis of TC, particularly emphasizing the role of anoikis resistance in metastatic spread and its potential as a therapeutic target.
