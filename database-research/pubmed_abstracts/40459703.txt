The protein kinase CβII (PKCβII) is a conventional PKC isoform that exerts both over-expression and downregulation in tumors.
Roles of PKCβII in tumor formation and progression remains poorly understood.
In the present study, we aimed to investigate the hypothesis that PKCβII overexpression promotes anoikis resistance in colon cancer cells.
