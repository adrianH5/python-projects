Solid tumors generate a local and systemic procoagulant state, placing cancer patients at risk of hemostatic complications.
The interplay between the tumor coagulome, a tumor-intrinsic determinant, and surgery-induced coagulopathy may influence the risk of recurrence following complete surgical resection.
Perioperative targeting of the coagulome could advance cancer precision treatment.
