Although radiation therapy (RT) has been established as a leading treatment for cancer patients, alongside surgery and chemotherapy, radiation itself is a well-known risk factor for carcinogenesis (Kamran et al., Cancer.
122(12):1809-21, 2016).
A second malignant neoplasm may occur even with a small radiation dose (Diallo et al., Int J Radiat Oncol, 74(3):876-83, 2009).
Relling et al.
estimated that the cumulative risk of the development of malignant brain tumors following prophylactic cranial RT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients is around 0.5%-1.5% at 15 years (Walter et al., J Clin Oncol Off J Am Soc Clin Oncol, 16(12):3761-7, 1998).
The most frequent tumor types of radiation-induced malignant brain tumors are meningioma, glioblastoma (GBM), and sarcoma (Onishi et al., 2024).
GBM--the most aggressive type of glioma--is classified as a high-grade glioma as per the WHO classification of tumors (Holland, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 97(12):6242-4, 2000; Louis et al., Neuro-Oncol 23(8):1231-51, 2021).
GBM still draws attention due to its poor prognosis.
The median overall survival (OS) of adult patients with GBM is approximately 12 months, and less than 5% of the patients might survive more than 5 years (Hertler et al., Eur J Cancer 189:112,913, 2023).
Whereas the definitive treatment for GBM patients is surgery, adjuvant RT, and chemotherapy, the appropriate re-irradiation dose for patients with radiation-induced GBM (RIGBM) is still controversial since a more critical decision on the radiation dose needs to be made considering that the incidence of brain necrosis increases as the radiation dose increases (Lawrence et al., Int J Radiat Oncol 76(3):S20-7, 2010).
