Childhood cancer has an annual incidence of 150-160 cases per million children worldwide but remains vastly underdiagnosed in low- to middle-income countries such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) serves a population of 25 million people, including 10 million children.
The average number of pediatric cancer diagnoses was 216 cases annually in 2017-2019, which was well below the anticipated 1500 cases based on epidemiology data.
The remaining 75%-80% of pediatric cancer cases remain undiagnosed, and these patients are not likely to survive.
Prior outreach and needs assessments demonstrated a lack of medical knowledge related to pediatric cancer as a primary barrier to improved referrals, diagnoses, and ultimately, cure.
