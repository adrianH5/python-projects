MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a significant tumor marker for early cancer screening.
Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) as an enzyme-free signal amplification method has been used for intracellular miR-21 detection in living cells, but it is limited by unclear reaction details and prolonged detection time.
In this study, by effectively regulating the HCR reaction conditions, we achieved rapid visualization of endogenous miR-21 in live cells.
