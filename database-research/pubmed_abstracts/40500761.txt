Based on improved survival, the 2017 ASCO and Cancer Care Ontario clinical guidelines (ACGD) recommended consideration of adjuvant bisphosphonates for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer (EBC).
However, small survey-based studies suggest inconsistent prescribing.
This study evaluated receipt of adjuvant bone modifying agents (BMAs) in the United States before and after publication of the 2017 ACGD.
