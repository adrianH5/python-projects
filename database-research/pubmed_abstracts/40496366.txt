Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare fibro-inflammatory condition which can be classified into idiopathic (accounting for over 75%) and secondary types (due to malignancies, infections, medications, radiotherapy or other conditions).
Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRPF) typically affects the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries along with the surrounding retroperitoneal area.
This case review aims to summarize the imaging characteristics of IRPF arising from the peritoneal space.
