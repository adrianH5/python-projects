Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in immunotherapy, especially in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy, but how tumor cells and immune cells cross-talk with each other remains elusive.
Thus, exploring the mechanisms is of urgent needs.
Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a key gap junction (GJ) protein, which allows tumor cells and immune cells to interact.
In this study, we systematically investigated the function of Cx43 in response to ICIs and observed that Cx43 promoted the activation of CD8
