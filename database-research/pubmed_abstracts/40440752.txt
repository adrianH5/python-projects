Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) has been identified as a useful biomarker for disease activity, prognosis, and treatment response in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).
However, its utility in Asian pwMS remains underexplored.
This study investigates the predictive value of sNfL for disease activity and long-term disability as well as the applicability of Western-derived z-scores in Korean MS patients.
