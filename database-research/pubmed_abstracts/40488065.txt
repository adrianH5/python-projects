Proteins are pivotal in life processes; however, the constraints of current detection technologies limit our comprehensive understanding of their mechanisms.
Disease progression, particularly in complex, multifactorial conditions, such as lung cancer, involves the dysregulation of numerous proteins.
While protein array technology has been at the forefront in proteomic analysis, its challenges in detection throughput, sensitivity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness have impeded its broader clinical application.
The enzymatic cleavage of proteins in the bloodstream into peptides of diverse sizes presents an opportunity for peptide array technology, providing both a theoretical basis and practical utility.
We have developed a high-throughput peptide array specifically designed for the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, encompassing peptides from 5 to 16 amino acids in length.
This array provides comprehensive coverage of peptides derived from proteins with high mutation frequencies in lung adenocarcinoma as well as those that are differentially expressed in association with the disease.
The array's potential for thorough lung cancer surveillance is demonstrated through the concurrent detection and classification of five distinct sample types: healthy controls, benign nodules, stage I lung adenocarcinoma, and both pre- and postoperative samples.
