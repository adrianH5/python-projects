Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of unknown primary (SCCUP) refers to any SCC for which the primary tumor origin cannot be identified despite guideline-directed evaluation.
Although strategies employing comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to identify targets for non-SCC carcinomas of unknown primary (CUPs) have shown benefit, the genomic landscape in SCCUP remains poorly defined.
Here we describe results of CGP in patients with SCCUP to identify potential therapy targets and characteristic biomarkers.
