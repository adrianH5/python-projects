Anorectal melanoma is a rare and aggressive neoplasm with a poor prognosis; the overall survival rate at 5Â years is around 20%.
We report two clinical cases involving patients who experienced pain and bleeding associated with an anorectal mass.
Histopathological studies confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma.
The first case presented with localized disease characterized by a black, pedunculated lesion with irreducible prolapse managed with wide local excision.
In the second case, the patient had a fixed, pink anal lesion accompanied by multiple inguinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies.
Due to the metastatic nature of the disease, immunotherapy was administered.
Both patients remain alive after 1 year of follow-up.
