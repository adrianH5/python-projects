Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a globally challenging digestive tract malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options.
Early-stage ESCC is often asymptomatic, leading to a late-stage diagnosis in many cases.
Neoadjuvant therapy combined with surgery is the standard treatment approach for locally advanced ESCC.
In recent years, immunotherapy has shown significant efficacy in ESCC.
However, various neoadjuvant treatment regimens, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, have produced inconsistent outcomes.
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) combined with immunotherapy compared with nCRT alone.
