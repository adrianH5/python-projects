Gastric cancer is rare in pediatric populations, with gastric signet ring cell carcinoma (GSRCC) being an exceptionally infrequent subtype.
We report a case of GSRCC in a 10-year-old Chinese boy with no family history of cancer.
The diagnosis was established via gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and imaging examinations.
Early detection allowed a successful distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection.
Postoperative whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed no clinically significant mutations but identified some somatic alterations.
Notably, gastric biopsy pathology demonstrated strong positivity for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.
Additionally, we comprehensively reviewed the existing pediatric GSRCC cases, suggesting the potential role of H. pylori infection in the pathogenesis of pediatric gastric cancer.
