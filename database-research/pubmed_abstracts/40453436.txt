Positron emission tomography with computed tomography using fluorine-18 fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) is routinely used for baseline staging and response assessment for esophageal squamous cell cancer (E-SCC).
Metastases in E-SCC are usually seen in regional lymph nodes and lungs with solitary metastases to the kidney being extremely rare.
We present a case of solitary unilateral renal metastasis detected on baseline F-18 FDG PET/CT in an otherwise operable E-SCC.
