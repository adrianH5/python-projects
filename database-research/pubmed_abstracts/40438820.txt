Background There is good evidence describing on-call pharmacy services internationally; however, there is limited evidence evaluating out-of-hours (OOH) calls from adult critical care units.
Our primary objective is to describe the characteristics of OOH calls from adult critical care units to resident pharmacists, to inform service provision to this high-risk specialty.
Our secondary objective is to compare the characteristics of calls during evening and nighttime hours.
Methods This is a retrospective observational review of adult critical care OOH calls received by resident pharmacists from August 2023 to July 2024 at a large tertiary center.
OOH calls were defined as calls received from 5 pm to 9 am Monday to Sunday, and we further differentiated the calls into evening calls (5 pm to 9 pm) and nighttime calls (9 pm to 9 am).
We collected the characteristics of OOH calls, i.e., patient age and sex, ward location, type of query (medicines information/advice or supply), drug requested, category of drug, route of administration, day of the week, date and time of call received, and duration to resolution of call.
We compared the characteristics of OOH calls during the evening (5 pm to 9 pm) vs. nighttime (9 pm to 9 am) using an independent samples t-test for continuous data and Pearson's Ï‡
