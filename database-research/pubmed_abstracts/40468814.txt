Fabricating innovative nanomaterials for cancer treatment is essential for reducing its morbidity.
The present study focuses on synthesizing, evaluating, and utilizing a bismuth nanosheet-reduced graphene oxide (BiNS-rGO) heterostructure for cancer combination therapy.
The successful fabrication of the heterostructure with regulated thickness and morphology was confirmed by structural characterization using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction.
Atomic force microscopy indicated the heterostructure height of 1.3 Â± 0.95 nm.
Moreover, high-resolution TEM confirmed the heterostructure configuration of the nanoparticles with a bismuth nanosheet (BiNS) plane distance of 0.33 nm.
Following the evaluation of the photothermal characteristics of the BiNS-rGO heterostructure, it was found that a light-to-heat conversion of
