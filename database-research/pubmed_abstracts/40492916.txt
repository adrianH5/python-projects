Purpose To compare both the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of CRC screening with CT colonography (CTC) with those of multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA) testing.
Materials and Methods A state-transition Markov model was constructed using updated natural history evidence for colorectal polyps applied to a hypothetical 10â€‰000-person cohort representative of the 45-year-old U.S. population.
Three screening strategies were modeled with these data: mt-sDNA testing every 3 years, the conventional CTC (CTC
