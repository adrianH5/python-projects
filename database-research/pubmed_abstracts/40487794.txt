Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to outperform computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although inconsistencies exist across studies.
We compared the performance of CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in diagnosing HCC according to various guidelines, and to assess the incremental value of a second-line examination.
