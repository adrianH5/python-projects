We report the first case of an asymptomatic woman with osteoclast-like giant cell-rich cervical squamous cell carcinoma (OGC-rich cervical SCC), where the detection of cancer was made possible only by routine cytological screening.
The presence of OGCs in cervical SCCs is an extremely rare phenomenon, with only 8 cases reported to date.
