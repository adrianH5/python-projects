Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an uncommon yet aggressive malignancy often diagnosed at advanced stages.
Its management is challenged by significant molecular heterogeneity and limited treatment options.
Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have identified actionable alterations, such as FGFR2 fusions, thereby facilitating a precision oncology approach for CCA management.
