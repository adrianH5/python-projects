Helicobacter pylori can be parasitic in gastric mucosa, which can cause a series of gastrointestinal diseases after infection and is closely related to gastritis, gastric ulcer, and gastric cancer.
The high prevalence of H. pylori infection in regions with poor medical infrastructure and inadequate sanitation areas remains a significant public health concern.
Consequently, the development of rapid, simple, and cost-effective screening methods for H. pylori detection in resource-limited settings is of paramount importance.
In this study, we conducted a community-based screening in Shitan Village, Guangdong Province, a remote and underdeveloped area characterized by a permanent population of approximately 300 residents with generally low educational attainment.
We employed a double antibody sandwich assay for the detection of H. pylori fecal antigen, a method chosen for its potential applicability in low-resource settings.
A total of 261 participants from the village were enrolled, and their fecal samples were analyzed using this technique.
For comparative validation, the same samples were subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis.
Compared with qPCR results, the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of H. pylori antigen in feces were 60.24% and 80.08%.
The results demonstrated a strong agreement between the fecal antigen detection method and qPCR (Kappa = 0.630).
This study systematically elucidated the principles, procedures, methodologies, and clinical applications of fecal antigen detection for H. pylori infection, aiming to explore latex-based double antibody sandwich technology and establish novel strategies and practical guidelines for its auxiliary diagnosis.
