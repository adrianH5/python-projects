The death of mammalian cells is generally regulated by a complex interplay amongst distinct molecular machineries that ultimately determines the kinetic and immunological consequences of the process.
Recent data from Song et al.
delineate a new metabolic circuitry through which apoptotic signals may actively suppress cell death via ferroptosis.
