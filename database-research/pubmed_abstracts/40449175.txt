Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary cause of cervical cancer.
Higher viral load, that is, a greater abundance of HPV DNA in a tumor, has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and may play a role in the more accurate prediction of (non-) responders to treatment.
In this study, we investigated the correlation between HPV viral load, clinical outcomes, and immune parameters related to HPV infection.
