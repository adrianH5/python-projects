Ganoderic acid T (GAT), a lanostane triterpenoid isolated from the methanol extract of G. lucidum mycelia, has demonstrated potent antitumor activity against various human cancer types.
However, the specific molecular targets of GAT in cancer cells remain largely unknown.
Therefore, this study systematically investigates these targets using the in vitro and in vivo hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model.
