Oral mucositis (OM) is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, causing pain, infections, swallowing/speech impairment, and poor quality of life.
We hypothesized that patterns (severity and dynamics) of OM and oral microbiota disruptions may be different after high-dose total body irradiation (TBI)- versus chemotherapy-based myeloablative conditioning.
