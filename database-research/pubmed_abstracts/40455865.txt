Cancer treatment frequently involves the use of radiotherapy, which is associated with several adverse effects, including fatigue, immunosuppression, and radiodermatitis.
Radiodermatitis affects up to 95% of patients worldwide.
This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in treating radiodermatitis in a rat model.
