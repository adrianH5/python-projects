The challenging subtype of breast cancer known as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence of HER2 expression, progesterone receptors, and estrogen receptors.
TNBC is linked to a harsh treatment trajectory, elevated rates of recurrence, and restricted therapeutic alternatives.
The mainstay of treatment for TNBC has historically been conventional chemotherapy, especially taxanes like docetaxel.
However, the effectiveness of these drugs is frequently compromised by systemic toxicity and resistance mechanisms.
The development of nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension (NDLS) offers a promising alternative designed to enhance the therapeutic index of docetaxel by improving solubility, reducing side effects, and optimizing tumortargeted drug delivery.
NDLS has the potential as a delivery system for additional chemotherapy drugs or combination treatments.
This review addresses the cellular and molecular causes of TNBC, emphasizes the drawbacks of traditional treatments, and offers a thorough examination of NDLS in preclinical and clinical settings.
It provides a thorough analysis of NDLS in TNBC, laying the groundwork for further studies and therapeutic applications.
