Locoregional treatment of breast cancer is based on surgery of the breast and axilla, radiotherapy of the breast or chest wall and regional lymph node areas.
A progressive therapeutic de-escalation was carried out in order to reduce the impact of the treatments.
This de-escalation will be considered for breast treatment and for lymph node area during primary surgical treatment and for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
