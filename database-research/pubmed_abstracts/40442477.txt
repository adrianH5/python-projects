Colloid cysts of the third ventricle are rare intracranial lesions, particularly uncommon in pediatric populations.
Precise incidence figures in children remain uncertain, with existing data primarily derived from isolated case reports and limited case series.
Pediatric colloid cysts generally present with a more aggressive clinical course, including hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure ICP, and even sudden death.
Despite the low incidence, the high risk of life-threatening complications often necessitates surgical intervention.
However, there is no consensus in the literature on the optimal surgical treatment for pediatric CCs, with microsurgical resection and endoscopic removal being the most commonly utilized methods.
This meta-analysis aims to compare the efficacy and safety of microsurgical and endoscopic approaches for treating pediatric colloid cysts, focusing on surgical outcomes such as gross total resection (GTR), capsule removal, postoperative complications, the need for ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting, and recurrence rates.
