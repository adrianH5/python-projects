Humans are remarkably resistant to invasive fungal diseases.
Whereas superficial fungal diseases by dermatophytes such as athlete's foot and onychomycosis are distressingly common, life-threatening fungal diseases are very rare unless the host is immunocompromised.
The remarkable resistance of immunologically intact hosts is believed to result from the combination of endothermy, which creates a thermal exclusion zone for many fungal species with pathogenic potential, and adaptive immunity with its humoral and cellular arms, which augments the protection provided by innate immunity.
However, the prevalence of fungal diseases continues to increase because of an ever-increasing number of immunocompromised hosts as a result of HIV infection and medical progress that comes at the price of weakened immunity such as organ transplantation and advances against cancer and autoimmune diseases.
The problem of fungal diseases is exacerbated by the absence of vaccines and the relative paucity of antifungal therapies and may worsen with climate change.
