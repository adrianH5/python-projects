Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening is recommended for high-risk smokers to decrease lung cancer-related mortality and increase prognosis.
In the U.S., the uptake of LDCT screening among eligible smokers is suboptimal.
The impacts of social-environmental and individual factors on LDCT screening uptake using nationally representative dataset recommendations are understudied.
The current study investigated multi-level factors associated with LDCT screening using national data.
