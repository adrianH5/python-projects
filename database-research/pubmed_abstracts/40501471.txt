Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the sixth most common cancer and fourth-leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, imposes a significant burden in Vietnam due to endemic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections.
Accurate prognostication is crucial for optimizing treatment and outcomes.
Numerous staging systems exist, including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC), cancer of the liver Italian Program (CLIP), Italian Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA), Japan Integrated Staging (JIS), Tokyo Score, and model to estimate survival in ambulatory HCC patients (MESIAH).
However, their comparative performance in Vietnamese patients remains underexplored.
