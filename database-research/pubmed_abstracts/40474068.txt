Public Health and Social Measures (PHSM) are among the commonly used methods to prevent the spread of Corona Virus Disease of 2029 (COVID-19).
Vaccination has also been an integral component of infectious disease prevention and control and it has been used widely to protect humans against some of the very serious diseases such as COVID-19.
People living with HIV (PLHIV) are known to be more vulnerable to the severest form of COVID-19 than the general population.
Other groups of people likely to get the severe form of COVID-19 include the elderly and those with co-morbidities such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the study was to establish socio-demographic factors that could determine COVID-19 vaccination status among PLHIV in selected regions in mainland Tanzania and to provide insight into ways to increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Tanzania.
