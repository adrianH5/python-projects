Obesity exacerbates hormonal dysregulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress, factors associated with Prostate Cancer (PCa) development.
The (epi)genetic influences of obesity may be transgenerationally transmitted, potentially impacting PCa susceptibility in the offspring of fathers with obesity.
Thus, we studied the impact of early-life or lifelong exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) on PCa biomarkers [Homeobox B13 (HOXB13) and the Androgen Receptor (AR)] and their correlation with obesity-related markers.
Furthermore, we focused on the offspring's PCa biomarkers outcomes and explored their potential link with paternal diet.
A transgenerational Mus musculus model was established, with F0 males exposed to different diets (200 days): standard chow, lifelong HFD (HFD), and transient diet (60 days HFD, plus 140 days of standard chow) (HFD
