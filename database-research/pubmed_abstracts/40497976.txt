Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of brain tumors, especially gliomas, which exhibit elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators within the tumor and its microenvironment.
Metabolic disturbances triggered by fluoride as a pro-oxidative agent in glioma cells, known for their high aggressiveness and resistance to therapy-remain poorly understood.
Therefore, investigating the impact of physiologically elevated fluoride concentrations on oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory responses in glioma cells represents a relevant and timely research objective.
