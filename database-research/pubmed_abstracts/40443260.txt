Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is an extremely lethal cancer, making early detection and precise staging essential for extending survival.
Upregulation of 5T4 mRNA was detected in bioinformatics analysis using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression.
In the current work, we confirmed the overexpression of 5T4 protein in tumor samples of PAAD compared with the corresponding paraneoplastic tissue.
To visualize 5T4 via positron emission tomography (PET) noninvasively, we successfully developed [
