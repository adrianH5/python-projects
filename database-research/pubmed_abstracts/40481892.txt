The lateral pelvic cavity is an anatomically tricky site to access using a linear approach; therefore, robot-assisted lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) may be superior over existing laparoscopic procedures.
In this study, we aimed to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of robot-assisted LLND (R-LLND) versus laparoscopic LLND (L-LLND) for locally advanced low rectal cancer and explore the potential advantages of robot-assisted surgery.
