Near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 900-1700 nm) fluorescence imaging as one of the emerging imaging methods has shown the advantages of excellent spatial resolution and sensitivity.
In order to obtain high-quality NIR-II fluorescence images and effective treatment results, it is essential to develop theranostic fluorescent nanoprobes with good tumor targeting and treatment capabilities.
Herein, we designed and synthesized novel NIR-II fluorescent theranostic nanoprobes based on the organic dye IR783.
IR783 was further encapsulated into liposomes, along with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the cervical cancer-targeting peptide TMTP1 (NVVRQ), to construct integrated nanoprobes for imaging and treatment.
The constructed IR-DT nanoprobes, with its good tumor targeting ability, exhibit excellent imaging performance and significant therapeutic effects.
With its powerful imaging capabilities, the IR-DT nanoprobes can achieve high-resolution fluorescence imaging of blood vessels, tumor lesions, and sentinel lymph nodes and could dynamically monitor the dissolution of carotid artery thrombi.
The treatment results demonstrate that the nanoprobes possess significant advantages in both tumor-targeting capability and therapeutic efficacy.
These findings suggest that it holds great potential to be developed into a theranostic nanoprobe for cervical cancer.
