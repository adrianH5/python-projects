Multivalent glycoclusters have been extensively used as a targeting agent for drug delivery.
However, tools capable of investigating their dynamic interactions with a target receptor remain elusive.
Here, we synthesized fluorescently-tagged galactoclusters for the fluorescence imaging of cells that overly express the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPr).
A trivalent galactoside was synthesized, to which a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dye was conjugated.
The resulting fluorescent glycocluster was used for the targeted fluorescence imaging of liver cancer cells with a high ASGPr expression level.
The trivalent probe was also demonstrated to be applicable for super-resolution imaging of ASGPr-mediated ligand endocytosis and the dynamic intracellular translocation to the lysosomes.
As such, this study provides a suitable chemical tool for the study of receptor dynamics using fluorescently tagged glycoclusters.
