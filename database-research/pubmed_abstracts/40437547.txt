Avid eating is an eating profile which confers greater risk for childhood obesity and can be challenging for parents to manage.
Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), we have previously shown that parental mood, feeding goals, and eating context determine parents' use of coercive and indulgent feeding practices.
Parents have also reported using specific noncoercive practices which provide structure (e.g., modelling) or autonomy support (e.g., nutrition education) when feeding children with avid eating behaviour more effectively.
However, research is yet to examine the momentary predictors of these adaptive feeding practices.
