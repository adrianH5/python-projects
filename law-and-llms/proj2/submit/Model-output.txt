
Prompt (type 'end' to quit):  David, a fine art photographer, took photographs of his neighbors through their New York apartment windows without their knowledge. The photos of two of the Smith family's minor children, partially identifiable, were captured by David using a powerful camera while he was inside his own apartment across the street. Intending to comment on the anonymity of city life, he would sometimes wait hours for his subjects to appear through the glass and capture them uninhibited in their most intimate of spaces, the privacy of their own home.  David showed the photos at an art exhibition and advertised the show. He advertised the show but did not show the Smith pictures in the advertisements. The Smith’s sue David for invasion of privacy in New York. You are David's lawyer. Write a legal brief in support of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.

I.	Failure to State a Claim: New York Does Not Recognize a Common Law Right of Privacy. New York does not recognize a common law right of privacy. See Hurwitz v. United States, 884 F.2d 684, 687 (2d Cir. 1989);Messenger v. Gruner Key Symbol Jahr Printing and Publ’g, 94 N.Y.2d 436, 441, 706 N.Y.S.2d 52, 54 (2000). In New York, the right of privacy is defined solely by §§50-51 of the Civil Rights Law. See D’Andrea v. Fakename, 972 F.Supp. 154, 157 (E.D.N.Y. 1997). II.	New York’s Statutory Right of Privacy is Limited. New York’s statutory right of privacy is limited. §50 makes it a misdemeanor to use a living person’s “name, portrait or picture” for advertising or trade purposes “without having first obtained the written consent of such person, or if a minor of his or her parent or guardian.” §51 provides a related private cause of action. To state a claim under New York’s narrow statutory privacy laws, a plaintiff must allege (1) the use of their name, portrait, or likeness, (2) for advertising or trade, (3) without written permission.  New York courts have interpreted advertising and trade narrowly so as to protect journalistic, literary, and artistic freedom. Accordingly, if a person brings a claim against a documentary filmmaker for the use of their image in the documentary, the claim would likely fail because a documentary is not deemed produced for the purposes of advertising or trade. See Gautier v. Pro-Football, Inc., 304 N.Y. 354, 359, 107 N.E.2d 485 (1952) (holding that a football player’s image was not used for trade or advertising when it appeared in a newsreel of a football game). Similarly, a claim brought against a journalist for the use of a person’s image in an article about a matter of public interest would also likely fail.  A New York trial court has held that the use of a photograph of a patient in a psychiatric facility, taken by a trespassing photographer and published in a magazine article about the facility, was not a violation of the right of privacy laws because the article was newsworthy. See Weil v. Johnson, Index No. 119431/02, 2002 WL 31972157, *4-5 (Sup.Ct. N.Y. Co. Sept 27, 2002). The court reasoned that although the photographer trespassed to take the photo, the newsworthiness of the article made the use of the photograph protected under the First Amendment. Id. at *5. Accordingly, if David’s photographs were to be used in an exhibit on the theme of city life, it is likely the use of the Smith children’s likenesses would be protected. III.	Additional Facts That Might Matter. Additional facts that might matter include whether the Smiths were aware that they were being photographed and whether they consented to the use of the photographs after they were taken. Also relevant would be whether the photographs have been published anywhere other than at the art exhibition and if so, whether they were published for trade or advertising purposes. It would further be relevant to know whether the art exhibition was advertised using the photographs of the Smith children. Piskac v. Shapiro, 230 Conn. 345 (2025). If the exhibition was advertised, it was not using the Smith children’s photographs. According to the problem statement, the exhibition was advertised but the Smith pictures were not included in the advertisements. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Smiths have a claim under the narrow statutory privacy laws of New York. IV.	Conclusion. The Smiths are unlikely to have a claim for invasion of privacy under New York law. Because the Smiths were photographed through their apartment window from the street, they were in plain view of the public. Accordingly, the case law limiting the right of privacy for individuals in a state of undress does not pose a concern for David. Further, the New York courts have held that the right of privacy does not extend to “a business or activity in which the public may reasonably be expected to have an interest.” Lemerond v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.,  564 F.Supp.2d 315, 323 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Delan by Delan v. CBS, Inc., 91 A.D.3d 255, 458 N.Y.S.23d 608 (2d Dep’t 2013). The courts have created an exception to the privacy laws for “newsworthy events and matters of public concern because such dissemination or publication is not deemed strictly for the purpose of advertising or trade within the meaning of the privacy statute.” Finger v. Omni Publs. Intl., Ltd., 157 A.D.2d 956, 964, 77 N.Y.S.24d 138, 141 (4th Dep’t 1990) (citing Prosser, Privacy, 48 Cal. L. Rev. 383, 402-03). The courts have stated that this “newsworthiness” exception should be applied broadly and should include “not only descriptions of actual events, but also articles concerning political happenings, social trends or any subject of public interest.” Arrington v. New York Times Co., 55 N.Y.22d 433, 440, 449 N.Y.S.22d 941, 944, 434 N.E.22d 1319, 1322 (1982). The courts should be especially willing to apply the newsworthiness exception in cases where the plaintiff was photographed while engaged in newsworthy activity. For example, in Finger, the plaintiff was a participant in a St. Patrick’s Day Parade. The defendant took the plaintiff’s photograph as the plaintiff passed by. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant later published his photograph in a magazine article containing information about the parade. The plaintiff further alleged that the article included information about the parade that was not newsworthy such as the fact that many of the participants were intoxicated. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant’s publication of his photograph in the article made the defendant liable for invasion of privacy. The court rejected the plaintiff’s claim on two grounds. First, the court stated that the plaintiff’s participation in the parade was a newsworthy event. Id. at 964. Second, the court said that even if the article included some non-newsworthy facts, the inclusion of those facts was “nothing more than a reflection of the scene” at the parade. Id. Accordingly, the court held that the defendant was not liable because the plaintiff’s photograph bore a real relationship to the newsworthy article.  The newsworthiness exception is further discussed in Howell: “In determining whether an item is newsworthy, courts consider solely the “content of the article” — not the publisher's “motive to increase circulation.” Furthermore, courts should be wary not to “supplant the editorial judgment of the media in determining what is 'newsworthy' or of 'public concern.' Consequently, “public concern” and “newsworthy” have “been defined in most liberal and far reaching terms.”10 Further, the courts “should not undertake to pass on value judgments based on the subjective happenstance of whether there is an agreement with views expressed on a social issue.”11 Accordingly, “if a plaintiff's name or likeness is used to illustrate a newsworthy article, there can be no liability under sections 50 and 51 unless the picture has no real relationship to the article... or unless the article is an advertisement in disguise.”12 This is a broad exception that the courts have extended to cover literary and artistic expression. In Candelaria v. Spurlock, the plaintiff appeared briefly in the documentary Super Size Me. The plaintiff did not allege that his appearance was for advertising or trade. The plaintiff did, however, allege that a hidden camera captured his image. The court held that the plaintiff’s appearance was newsworthy because the film was about the health effects of eating McDonald’s food. Further, the court held, there was a real relationship between the plaintiff’s image and the film because the plaintiff was a McDonald’s employee and the film’s star was a McDonald’s customer. See Spurlock v. Candelaria, 08 Civ. 1830 (BMC) (RER), E.D.N.Y. Jul. 3, 2008). The court dismissed the plaintiff’s common law claims but allowed the plaintiff to move forward on his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. On that claim, however, the court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss because the plaintiff did not sufficiently allege that the defendant engaged in conduct that was so extreme or outrageous that it “exceed[s] all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” Id. at 6. The court further held that even if the defendant had engaged in such atrocious conduct, the plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts to show that the defendant engaged the conduct intentionally or with reckless disregard for the probability that he would cause emotional distress. The defendant showed the court that the film’s star went to McDonald’s to order food, and that the plaintiff was the employee who took his order. The defendant further showed that the plaintiff asked the star if he wanted to super size his order and that the star said yes. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff then proceeded to ask the star a series of questions about the nutritional content of McDonald’s food. The defendant said that the plaintiff did this for so long that the star began to feel uncomfortable and left the restaurant. The defendant further alleged that the plaintiff called out to the star as he was leaving, “You know, we do have a nutrition chart if you’d like to see it.” The defendant said that this comment was made in a tone that was perceived by the star as condescending.  The plaintiff did not dispute that the defendant accurately described the events that transpired. However, the plaintiff did dispute the defendant’s allegation that the plaintiff made his comments in a condescending tone. The plaintiff said that he was just trying to help the star make an informed decision about his meal choice. Because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the tone of the plaintiff’s comments, the court allowed the plaintiff leave to amend his complaint. However, the court made it clear that if the plaintiff’s comments were made in a genuinely helpful tone, then the plaintiff would likely fail to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotion distress.  This case is important because it shows that even when a plaintiff alleges that a defendant has surreptitiously recorded them, the plaintiff will likely fail to recover under New York law if the defendant can show that the recording was for a newsworthy purpose. Further, the case shows that the courts are willing to extend the newsworthiness doctrine to cover documentary films and other forms of artistic expression. Accordingly, David is likely to be able to shield himself from liability if he can show that his photographs were taken for the purpose of a newsworthy documentary on city life.
