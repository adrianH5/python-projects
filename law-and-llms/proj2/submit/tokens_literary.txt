1 . The Cyclon ##e Dorothy liv ##ed in the midst of the great Kansas prairies , with Uncle Henry , who was a farmer , and Aunt Em , who was the farmer ' s wif ##e . Their house was small , for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles . There wer ##e four walls , a floor and a roof , which mad ##e on ##e room ; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstov ##e , a cupboard for the dishes , a table , three or four chairs , and the beds . Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in on ##e corner , and Dorothy a little bed in another corner . There was no garret at all , and no cellar - - except a small hol ##e dug in the ground , call ##ed a cyclon ##e cellar , where the family could go in cas ##e on ##e of thos ##e great whirlwinds aros ##e , mighty enough to crush any building in its path . It was reach ##ed by a trap door in the middle of the floor , from which a ladder led down into the small , dark hol ##e . When Dorothy stood in the doorway and look ##ed around , sh ##e could see nothing but the great gray prairi ##e on every sid ##e . Not a tre ##e nor a house brok ##e the broad sweep of flat country that reach ##ed to the edg ##e of the sky in all directions . The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass , with little cracks running through it . Even the grass was not green , for the sun had burn ##ed the tops of the long blades until they wer ##e the sam ##e gray color to be seen everywher ##e . Onc ##e the house had been painted , but the sun blistered the paint and the rains wash ##ed it away , and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else . When Aunt Em cam ##e there to liv ##e sh ##e was a young , pretty wif ##e . The sun and wind had chang ##ed her , too . They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray ; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips , and they wer ##e gray also . Sh ##e was thin and gaunt , and never smil ##ed now . When Dorothy , who was an orphan , first cam ##e to her , Aunt Em had been so startled by the child ' s laughter that sh ##e would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy ' s merry voic ##e reach ##ed her ears ; and sh ##e still look ##ed at the little girl with wonder that sh ##e could find anything to laugh at . Uncle Henry never laugh ##ed . H ##e work ##ed hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was . H ##e was gray also , from his long beard to his rough boots , and he look ##ed stern and solemn , and rarely spok ##e . It was Toto that mad ##e Dorothy laugh , and sav ##ed her from growing as gray as her other surroundings . Toto was not gray ; he was a little black dog , with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either sid ##e of his funny , wee nos ##e . Toto played all day long , and Dorothy played with him , and lov ##ed him dearly . Today , however , they wer ##e not playing . Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and look ##ed anxiously at the sky , which was even grayer than usual . Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms , and look ##ed at the sky too . Aunt Em was washing the dishes . From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind , and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bow ##ed in waves befor ##e the coming storm . There now cam ##e a sharp whistling in the air from the south , and as they turn ##ed their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also . Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up . " There ' s a cyclon ##e coming , Em , " he call ##ed to his wif ##e . " I ' ll go look after the stock . " Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses wer ##e kept . Aunt Em dropped her work and cam ##e to the door . On ##e glanc ##e told her of the danger clos ##e at hand . " Quick , Dorothy ! " sh ##e scream ##ed . " Run for the cellar ! " Toto jump ##ed out of Dorothy ' s arms and hid under the bed , and the girl started to get him . Aunt Em , badly frighten ##ed , threw open the trap door in the floor and climb ##ed down the ladder into the small , dark hol ##e . Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt . When sh ##e was halfway across the room there cam ##e a great shriek from the wind , and the house shook so hard that sh ##e lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor . Then a strang ##e thing happen ##ed . The house whirled around two or three times and ros ##e slowly through the air . Dorothy felt as if sh ##e wer ##e going up in a balloon . The north and south winds met where the house stood , and mad ##e it the exact center of the cyclon ##e . In the middle of a cyclon ##e the air is generally still , but the great pressur ##e of the wind on every sid ##e of the house rais ##ed it up higher and higher , until it was at the very top of the cyclon ##e ; and there it remain ##ed and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather . It was very dark , and the wind howled horribly around her , but Dorothy found sh ##e was riding quit ##e easily . After the first few whirls around , and on ##e other tim ##e when the house tipped badly , sh ##e felt as if sh ##e wer ##e being rock ##ed gently , lik ##e a baby in a cradle . Toto did not lik ##e it . H ##e ran about the room , now her ##e , now there , barking loudly ; but Dorothy sat quit ##e still on the floor and wait ##ed to see what would happen . Onc ##e Toto got too near the open trap door , and fell in ; and at first the little girl thought sh ##e had lost him . But soon sh ##e saw on ##e of his ears sticking up through the hol ##e , for the strong pressur ##e of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall . Sh ##e crept to the hol ##e , caught Toto by the ear , and dragged him into the room again , afterward closing the trap door so that no mor ##e accidents could happen . Hour after hour pass ##ed away , and slowly Dorothy got over her fright ; but sh ##e felt quit ##e lonely , and the wind shriek ##ed so loudly all about her that sh ##e nearly becam ##e deaf . At first sh ##e had wondered if sh ##e would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again ; but as the hours pass ##ed and nothing terrible happen ##ed , sh ##e stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the futur ##e would bring . At last sh ##e crawled over the swaying floor to her bed , and lay down upon it ; and Toto follow ##ed and lay down besid ##e her . In spit ##e of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind , Dorothy soon clos ##ed her eyes and fell fast asleep . 2 . The Council with the Munchkins Sh ##e was awaken ##ed by a shock , so sudden and sever ##e that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed sh ##e might hav ##e been hurt . As it was , the jar mad ##e her catch her breath and wonder what had happen ##ed ; and Toto put his cold little nos ##e into her fac ##e and whined dismally . Dorothy sat up and notic ##ed that the house was not moving ; nor was it dark , for the bright sunshin ##e cam ##e in at the window , flooding the little room . Sh ##e sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and open ##ed the door . The little girl gav ##e a cry of amazement and look ##ed about her , her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights sh ##e saw . The cyclon ##e had set the house down very gently - - for a cyclon ##e - - in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty . There wer ##e lovely patches of greensward all about , with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits . Banks of gorgeous flowers wer ##e on every hand , and birds with rar ##e and brilliant plumag ##e sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes . A little way off was a small brook , rushing and sparkling along between green banks , and murmuring in a voic ##e very grateful to a little girl who had liv ##ed so long on the dry , gray prairies . Whil ##e sh ##e stood looking eagerly at the strang ##e and beautiful sights , sh ##e notic ##ed coming toward her a group of the queerest people sh ##e had ever seen . They wer ##e not as big as the grown folk sh ##e had always been us ##ed to ; but neither wer ##e they very small . In fact , they seem ##ed about as tall as Dorothy , who was a well - grown child for her ag ##e , although they wer ##e , so far as looks go , many years older . Three wer ##e men and on ##e a woman , and all wer ##e oddly dress ##ed . They wor ##e round hats that ros ##e to a small point a foot abov ##e their heads , with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they mov ##ed . The hats of the men wer ##e blu ##e ; the little woman ' s hat was whit ##e , and sh ##e wor ##e a whit ##e gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders . Over it wer ##e sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun lik ##e diamonds . The men wer ##e dress ##ed in blu ##e , of the sam ##e shad ##e as their hats , and wor ##e well - polished boots with a deep roll of blu ##e at the tops . The men , Dorothy thought , wer ##e about as old as Uncle Henry , for two of them had beards . But the little woman was doubtless much older . Her fac ##e was cover ##ed with wrinkles , her hair was nearly whit ##e , and sh ##e walk ##ed rather stiffly . When thes ##e people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway , they paused and whispered among themselves , as if afraid to com ##e farther . But the little old woman walk ##ed up to Dorothy , mad ##e a low bow and said , in a sweet voic ##e : " You ar ##e welcom ##e , most noble Sorceress , to the land of the Munchkins . W ##e ar ##e so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East , and for setting our people free from bondag ##e . " Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder . What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress , and saying sh ##e had killed the Wicked Witch of the East ? Dorothy was an innocent , harmless little girl , who had been carried by a cyclon ##e many miles from hom ##e ; and sh ##e had never killed anything in all her lif ##e . But the little woman evidently expected her to answer ; so Dorothy said , with hesitation , " You ar ##e very kind , but there must be some mistak ##e . I hav ##e not killed anything . " " Your house did , anyway , " replied the little old woman , with a laugh , " and that is the sam ##e thing . See ! " sh ##e continu ##ed , pointing to the corner of the house . " There ar ##e her two feet , still sticking out from under a block of wood . " Dorothy look ##ed , and gav ##e a little cry of fright . There , indeed , just under the corner of the great beam the house rest ##ed on , two feet wer ##e sticking out , shod in silver shoes with pointed toes . " Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! " cried Dorothy , clasping her hands together in dismay . " The house must hav ##e fallen on her . Whatever shall we do ? " " There is nothing to be don ##e , " said the little woman calmly . " But who was sh ##e ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " Sh ##e was the Wicked Witch of the East , as I said , " answered the little woman . " Sh ##e has held all the Munchkins in bondag ##e for many years , making them slav ##e for her night and day . Now they ar ##e all set free , and ar ##e grateful to you for the favor . " " Who ar ##e the Munchkins ? " inquired Dorothy . " They ar ##e the people who liv ##e in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled . " " Ar ##e you a Munchkin ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " No , but I am their friend , although I liv ##e in the land of the North . When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift mess ##en ##g ##er to me , and I cam ##e at onc ##e . I am the Witch of the North . " " Oh , gracious ! " cried Dorothy . " Ar ##e you a real witch ? " " Yes , indeed , " answered the little woman . " But I am a good witch , and the people lov ##e me . I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruled her ##e , or I should hav ##e set the people free myself . " " But I thought all witches wer ##e wicked , " said the girl , who was half frighten ##ed at facing a real witch . " Oh , no , that is a great mistak ##e . There wer ##e only four witches in all the Land of Oz , and two of them , thos ##e who liv ##e in the North and the South , ar ##e good witches . I know this is tru ##e , for I am on ##e of them myself , and cannot be mistaken . Thos ##e who dwelt in the East and the West wer ##e , indeed , wicked witches ; but now that you hav ##e killed on ##e of them , there is but on ##e Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz - - the on ##e who lives in the West . " " But , " said Dorothy , after a moment ' s thought , " Aunt Em has told me that the witches wer ##e all dead - - years and years ago . " " Who is Aunt Em ? " inquired the little old woman . " Sh ##e is my aunt who lives in Kansas , where I cam ##e from . " The Witch of the North seem ##ed to think for a tim ##e , with her head bow ##ed and her eyes upon the ground . Then sh ##e look ##ed up and said , " I do not know where Kansas is , for I hav ##e never heard that country mention ##ed befor ##e . But tell me , is it a civilized country ? " " Oh , yes , " replied Dorothy . " Then that accounts for it . In the civilized countries I believ ##e there ar ##e no witches left , nor wizards , nor sorceresses , nor magicians . But , you see , the Land of Oz has never been civilized , for we ar ##e cut off from all the rest of the world . Therefor ##e we still hav ##e witches and wizards amongst us . " " Who ar ##e the wizards ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " Oz himself is the Gr ##e ##at Wizard , " answered the Witch , sinking her voic ##e to a whisper . " H ##e is mor ##e powerful than all the rest of us together . H ##e lives in the City of Emeralds . " Dorothy was going to ask another question , but just then the Munchkins , who had been standing silently by , gav ##e a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying . " What is it ? " ask ##ed the little old woman , and look ##ed , and began to laugh . The feet of the dead Witch had disappear ##ed entirely , and nothing was left but the silver shoes . " Sh ##e was so old , " explained the Witch of the North , that sh ##e dried up quickly in the sun . That is the end of her . But the silver shoes ar ##e yours , and you shall hav ##e them to wear . " Sh ##e reach ##ed down and pick ##ed up the shoes , and after shaking the dust out of them hand ##ed them to Dorothy . " The Witch of the East was proud of thos ##e silver shoes , " said on ##e of the Munchkins , " and there is some charm connected with them ; but what it is we never knew . " Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and plac ##ed them on the table . Then sh ##e cam ##e out again to the Munchkins and said : " I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle , for I am sur ##e they will worry about me . Can you help me find my way ? " The Munchkins and the Witch first look ##ed at on ##e another , and then at Dorothy , and then shook their heads . " At the East , not far from her ##e , " said on ##e , " there is a great desert , and non ##e could liv ##e to cross it . " " It is the sam ##e at the South , " said another , " for I hav ##e been there and seen it . The South is the country of the Quadlings . " " I am told , " said the third man , " that it is the sam ##e at the West . And that country , where the Winkies liv ##e , is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West , who would mak ##e you her slav ##e if you pass ##ed her way . " " The North is my hom ##e , " said the old lady , " and at its edg ##e is the sam ##e great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz . I ' m afraid , my dear , you will hav ##e to liv ##e with us . " Dorothy began to sob at this , for sh ##e felt lonely among all thes ##e strang ##e people . Her tears seem ##ed to griev ##e the kind - hearted Munchkins , for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also . As for the little old woman , sh ##e took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nos ##e , whil ##e sh ##e counted " On ##e , two , three " in a solemn voic ##e . At onc ##e the cap chang ##ed to a slat ##e , on which was written in big , whit ##e chalk marks : " LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS " The little old woman took the slat ##e from her nos ##e , and having read the words on it , ask ##ed , " Is your nam ##e Dorothy , my dear ? " " Yes , " answered the child , looking up and drying her tears . " Then you must go to the City of Emeralds . Perhaps Oz will help you . " " Wher ##e is this city ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " It is exactly in the center of the country , and is ruled by Oz , the Gr ##e ##at Wizard I told you of . " " Is he a good man ? " inquired the girl anxiously . " H ##e is a good Wizard . Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell , for I hav ##e never seen him . " " How can I get there ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " You must walk . It is a long journey , through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible . However , I will us ##e all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm . " " Won ' t you go with me ? " pleaded the girl , who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend . " No , I cannot do that , " sh ##e replied , " but I will giv ##e you my kiss , and no on ##e will dar ##e injur ##e a person who has been kiss ##ed by the Witch of the North . " Sh ##e cam ##e clos ##e to Dorothy and kiss ##ed her gently on the forehead . Wher ##e her lips touch ##ed the girl they left a round , shining mark , as Dorothy found out soon after . " The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick , " said the Witch , " so you cannot miss it . When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him , but tell your story and ask him to help you . Good - by ##e , my dear . " The three Munchkins bow ##ed low to her and wish ##ed her a pleasant journey , after which they walk ##ed away through the trees . The Witch gav ##e Dorothy a friendly little nod , whirled around on her left heel three times , and straightway disappear ##ed , much to the surpris ##e of little Toto , who bark ##ed after her loudly enough when sh ##e had gon ##e , because he had been afraid even to growl whil ##e sh ##e stood by . But Dorothy , knowing her to be a witch , had expected her to disappear in just that way , and was not surpris ##ed in the least . 3 . How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow When Dorothy was left alon ##e sh ##e began to feel hungry . So sh ##e went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread , which sh ##e spread with butter . Sh ##e gav ##e some to Toto , and taking a pail from the shelf sh ##e carried it down to the little brook and fill ##ed it with clear , sparkling water . Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there . Dorothy went to get him , and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that sh ##e gathered some of it , finding it just what sh ##e want ##ed to help out her breakfast . Then sh ##e went back to the house , and having help ##ed herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool , clear water , sh ##e set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds . Dorothy had only on ##e other dress , but that happen ##ed to be clean and was hanging on a peg besid ##e her bed . It was gingham , with checks of whit ##e and blu ##e ; and although the blu ##e was somewhat faded with many washings , it was still a pretty frock . The girl wash ##ed herself carefully , dress ##ed herself in the clean gingham , and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head . Sh ##e took a little basket and fill ##ed it with bread from the cupboard , laying a whit ##e cloth over the top . Then sh ##e look ##ed down at her feet and notic ##ed how old and worn her shoes wer ##e . " They surely will never do for a long journey , Toto , " sh ##e said . And Toto look ##ed up into her fac ##e with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what sh ##e meant . At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belong ##ed to the Witch of the East . " I wonder if they will fit me , " sh ##e said to Toto . " They would be just the thing to tak ##e a long walk in , for they could not wear out . " Sh ##e took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones , which fitted her as well as if they had been mad ##e for her . Finally sh ##e pick ##ed up her basket . " Com ##e along , Toto , " sh ##e said . " W ##e will go to the Emerald City and ask the Gr ##e ##at Oz how to get back to Kansas again . " Sh ##e clos ##ed the door , locked it , and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress . And so , with Toto trotting along soberly behind her , sh ##e started on her journey . There wer ##e several roads near by , but it did not tak ##e her long to find the on ##e paved with yellow bricks . Within a short tim ##e sh ##e was walking briskly toward the Emerald City , her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard , yellow road - bed . The sun shon ##e bright and the birds sang sweetly , and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strang ##e land . Sh ##e was surpris ##ed , as sh ##e walk ##ed along , to see how pretty the country was about her . There wer ##e neat fences at the sides of the road , painted a dainty blu ##e color , and beyond them wer ##e fields of grain and vegetables in abundanc ##e . Evidently the Munchkins wer ##e good farmers and able to rais ##e larg ##e crops . Onc ##e in a whil ##e sh ##e would pass a house , and the people cam ##e out to look at her and bow low as sh ##e went by ; for everyon ##e knew sh ##e had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondag ##e . The houses of the Munchkins wer ##e odd - looking dwellings , for each was round , with a big dom ##e for a roof . All wer ##e painted blu ##e , for in this country of the East blu ##e was the favorit ##e color . Toward evening , when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where sh ##e should pass the night , sh ##e cam ##e to a house rather larger than the rest . On the green lawn befor ##e it many men and women wer ##e dancing . Fiv ##e little fiddlers played as loudly as possible , and the people wer ##e laughing and singing , whil ##e a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts , pies and cakes , and many other good things to eat . The people greeted Dorothy kindly , and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them ; for this was the hom ##e of on ##e of the richest Munchkins in the land , and his friends wer ##e gathered with him to cel ##e ##brat ##e their freedom from the bondag ##e of the Wicked Witch . Dorothy at ##e a hearty supper and was wait ##ed upon by the rich Munchkin himself , whos ##e nam ##e was Boq . Then sh ##e sat upon a settee and watch ##ed the people danc ##e . When Boq saw her silver shoes he said , " You must be a great sorceress . " " Why ? " ask ##ed the girl . " Because you wear silver shoes and hav ##e killed the Wicked Witch . Besides , you hav ##e whit ##e in your frock , and only witches and sorceresses wear whit ##e . " " My dress is blu ##e and whit ##e checked , " said Dorothy , smoothing out the wrinkles in it . " It is kind of you to wear that , " said Boq . " Blu ##e is the color of the Munchkins , and whit ##e is the witch color . So we know you ar ##e a friendly witch . " Dorothy did not know what to say to this , for all the people seem ##ed to think her a witch , and sh ##e knew very well sh ##e was only an ordinary little girl who had com ##e by the chanc ##e of a cyclon ##e into a strang ##e land . When sh ##e had tired watching the dancing , Boq led her into the house , where he gav ##e her a room with a pretty bed in it . The sheets wer ##e mad ##e of blu ##e cloth , and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning , with Toto curled up on the blu ##e rug besid ##e her . Sh ##e at ##e a hearty breakfast , and watch ##ed a wee Munchkin baby , who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crow ##ed and laugh ##ed in a way that greatly amus ##ed Dorothy . Toto was a fin ##e curiosity to all the people , for they had never seen a dog befor ##e . " How far is it to the Emerald City ? " the girl ask ##ed . " I do not know , " answered Boq gravely , " for I hav ##e never been there . It is better for people to keep away from Oz , unless they hav ##e business with him . But it is a long way to the Emerald City , and it will tak ##e you many days . The country her ##e is rich and pleasant , but you must pass through rough and dangerous places befor ##e you reach the end of your journey . " This worried Dorothy a little , but sh ##e knew that only the Gr ##e ##at Oz could help her get to Kansas again , so sh ##e bravely resolved not to turn back . Sh ##e bad ##e her friends good - by ##e , and again started along the road of yellow brick . When sh ##e had gon ##e several miles sh ##e thought sh ##e would stop to rest , and so climb ##ed to the top of the fenc ##e besid ##e the road and sat down . There was a great cornfield beyond the fenc ##e , and not far away sh ##e saw a Scarecrow , plac ##ed high on a pol ##e to keep the birds from the rip ##e corn . Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gaz ##ed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow . Its head was a small sack stuff ##ed with straw , with eyes , nos ##e , and mouth painted on it to represent a fac ##e . An old , pointed blu ##e hat , that had belong ##ed to some Munchkin , was perched on his head , and the rest of the figur ##e was a blu ##e suit of clothes , worn and faded , which had also been stuff ##ed with straw . On the feet wer ##e some old boots with blu ##e tops , such as every man wor ##e in this country , and the figur ##e was rais ##ed abov ##e the stalks of corn by means of the pol ##e stuck up its back . Whil ##e Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer , painted fac ##e of the Scarecrow , sh ##e was surpris ##ed to see on ##e of the eyes slowly wink at her . Sh ##e thought sh ##e must hav ##e been mistaken at first , for non ##e of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink ; but presently the figur ##e nodded its head to her in a friendly way . Then sh ##e climb ##ed down from the fenc ##e and walk ##ed up to it , whil ##e Toto ran around the pol ##e and bark ##ed . " Good day , " said the Scarecrow , in a rather husky voic ##e . " Did you speak ? " ask ##ed the girl , in wonder . " Certainly , " answered the Scarecrow . " How do you do ? " " I ' m pretty well , thank you , " replied Dorothy politely . " How do you do ? " " I ' m not feeling well , " said the Scarecrow , with a smil ##e , " for it is very tedious being perched up her ##e night and day to scar ##e away crows . " " Can ' t you get down ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " No , for this pol ##e is stuck up my back . If you will pleas ##e tak ##e away the pol ##e I shall be greatly obliged to you . " Dorothy reach ##ed up both arms and lifted the figur ##e off the pol ##e , for , being stuff ##ed with straw , it was quit ##e light . " Thank you very much , " said the Scarecrow , when he had been set down on the ground . " I feel lik ##e a new man . " Dorothy was puzzled at this , for it sound ##ed queer to hear a stuff ##ed man speak , and to see him bow and walk along besid ##e her . " Who ar ##e you ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow when he had stretch ##ed himself and yawned . " And where ar ##e you going ? " " My nam ##e is Dorothy , " said the girl , " and I am going to the Emerald City , to ask the Gr ##e ##at Oz to send me back to Kansas . " " Wher ##e is the Emerald City ? " he inquired . " And who is Oz ? " " Why , don ' t you know ? " sh ##e return ##ed , in surpris ##e . " No , indeed . I don ' t know anything . You see , I am stuff ##ed , so I hav ##e no brains at all , " he answered sadly . " Oh , " said Dorothy , " I ' m awfully sorry for you . " " Do you think , " he ask ##ed , " if I go to the Emerald City with you , that Oz would giv ##e me some brains ? " " I cannot tell , " sh ##e return ##ed , " but you may com ##e with me , if you lik ##e . If Oz will not giv ##e you any brains you will be no worse off than you ar ##e now . " " That is tru ##e , " said the Scarecrow . " You see , " he continu ##ed confidentially , " I don ' t mind my legs and arms and body being stuff ##ed , because I cannot get hurt . If anyon ##e treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me , it doesn ' t matter , for I can ' t feel it . But I do not want people to call me a fool , and if my head stays stuff ##ed with straw instead of with brains , as yours is , how am I ever to know anything ? " " I understand how you feel , " said the little girl , who was truly sorry for him . " If you will com ##e with me I ' ll ask Oz to do all he can for you . " " Thank you , " he answered gratefully . They walk ##ed back to the road . Dorothy help ##ed him over the fenc ##e , and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City . Toto did not lik ##e this addition to the party at first . H ##e smell ##ed around the stuff ##ed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw , and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow . " Don ' t mind Toto , " said Dorothy to her new friend . " H ##e never bites . " " Oh , I ' m not afraid , " replied the Scarecrow . " H ##e can ' t hurt the straw . Do let me carry that basket for you . I shall not mind it , for I can ' t get tired . I ' ll tell you a secret , " he continu ##ed , as he walk ##ed along . " There is only on ##e thing in the world I am afraid of . " " What is that ? " ask ##ed Dorothy ; " the Munchkin farmer who mad ##e you ? " " No , " answered the Scarecrow ; " it ' s a light ##ed match . " 4 . The Road Through the Forest After a few hours the road began to be rough , and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks , which wer ##e her ##e very uneven . Sometimes , indeed , they wer ##e broken or missing altogether , leaving holes that Toto jump ##ed across and Dorothy walk ##ed around . As for the Scarecrow , having no brains , he walk ##ed straight ahead , and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks . It never hurt him , however , and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again , whil ##e he join ##ed her in laughing merrily at his own mishap . The farms wer ##e not nearly so well cared for her ##e as they wer ##e farther back . There wer ##e fewer houses and fewer fruit trees , and the farther they went the mor ##e dismal and lonesom ##e the country becam ##e . At noon they sat down by the roadsid ##e , near a little brook , and Dorothy open ##ed her basket and got out some bread . Sh ##e offered a piec ##e to the Scarecrow , but he refused . " I am never hungry , " he said , " and it is a lucky thing I am not , for my mouth is only painted , and if I should cut a hol ##e in it so I could eat , the straw I am stuff ##ed with would com ##e out , and that would spoil the shap ##e of my head . " Dorothy saw at onc ##e that this was tru ##e , so sh ##e only nodded and went on eating her bread . " Tell me something about yourself and the country you cam ##e from , " said the Scarecrow , when sh ##e had finished her dinner . So sh ##e told him all about Kansas , and how gray everything was there , and how the cyclon ##e had carried her to this queer Land of Oz . The Scarecrow listened carefully , and said , " I cannot understand why you should wish to leav ##e this beautiful country and go back to the dry , gray plac ##e you call Kansas . " " That is because you hav ##e no brains " answered the girl . " No matter how dreary and gray our homes ar ##e , we people of flesh and blood would rather liv ##e there than in any other country , be it ever so beautiful . There is no plac ##e lik ##e hom ##e . " The Scarecrow sigh ##ed . " Of course I cannot understand it , " he said . " If your heads wer ##e stuff ##ed with straw , lik ##e min ##e , you would probably all liv ##e in the beautiful places , and then Kansas would hav ##e no people at all . It is fortunat ##e for Kansas that you hav ##e brains . " " Won ' t you tell me a story , whil ##e we ar ##e resting ? " ask ##ed the child . The Scarecrow look ##ed at her reproachfully , and answered : " My lif ##e has been so short that I really know nothing whatever . I was only mad ##e day befor ##e yesterday . What happen ##ed in the world befor ##e that tim ##e is all unknown to me . Luckily , when the farmer mad ##e my head , on ##e of the first things he did was to paint my ears , so that I heard what was going on . There was another Munchkin with him , and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying , ` How do you lik ##e thos ##e ears ? ' " ` They aren ' t straight , ' " answered the other . " ` Never mind , ' " said the farmer . " ` They ar ##e ears just the sam ##e , ' " which was tru ##e enough . " ` Now I ' ll mak ##e the eyes , ' " said the farmer . So he painted my right ey ##e , and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity , for this was my first glimpse of the world . " ` That ' s a rather pretty ey ##e , ' " remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer . " ` Blu ##e paint is just the color for eyes . ' " ` I think I ' ll mak ##e the other a little bigger , ' " said the farmer . And when the second ey ##e was don ##e I could see much better than befor ##e . Then he mad ##e my nos ##e and my mouth . But I did not speak , because at that tim ##e I didn ' t know what a mouth was for . I had the fun of watching them mak ##e my body and my arms and legs ; and when they fasten ##ed on my head , at last , I felt very proud , forI thought I was just as good a man as anyon ##e . " ` This fellow will scar ##e the crows fast enough , ' said the farmer . ` H ##e looks just lik ##e a man . ' " ` Why , he is a man , ' said the other , and I quit ##e agreed with him . The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield , and set me up on a tall stick , where you found me . H ##e and his friend soon after walk ##ed away and left me alon ##e . " I did not lik ##e to be deserted this way . So I tried to walk after them . But my feet would not touch the ground , and I was forc ##ed to stay on that pol ##e . It was a lonely lif ##e to lead , for I had nothing to think of , having been mad ##e such a little whil ##e befor ##e . Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield , but as soon as they saw me they flew away again , thinking I was a Munchkin ; and this pleas ##ed me and mad ##e me feel that I was quit ##e an important person . By and by an old crow flew near me , and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said : " ` I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner . Any crow of sense could see that you ar ##e only stuff ##ed with straw . ' Then he hopped down at my feet and at ##e all the corn he want ##ed . The other birds , seeing he was not harm ##ed by me , cam ##e to eat the corn too , so in a short tim ##e there was a great flock of them about me . " I felt sad at this , for it show ##ed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all ; but the old crow comforted me , saying , ` If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them , and a better man than some of them . Brains ar ##e the only things worth having in this world , no matter whether on ##e is a crow or a man . ' " After the crows had gon ##e I thought this over , and decid ##ed I would try hard to get some brains . By good luck you cam ##e along and pulled me off the stak ##e , and from what you say I am sur ##e the Gr ##e ##at Oz will giv ##e me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City . " " I hop ##e so , " said Dorothy earnestly , " sinc ##e you seem anxious to hav ##e them . " " Oh , yes ; I am anxious , " return ##ed the Scarecrow . " It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know on ##e is a fool . " " Well , " said the girl , " let us go . " And sh ##e hand ##ed the basket to the Scarecrow . There wer ##e no fences at all by the roadsid ##e now , and the land was rough and untilled . Toward evening they cam ##e to a great forest , where the trees grew so big and clos ##e together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick . It was almost dark under the trees , for the branches shut out the daylight ; but the travelers did not stop , and went on into the forest . " If this road goes in , it must com ##e out , " said the Scarecrow , " and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road , we must go wherever it leads us . " " Anyon ##e would know that , " said Dorothy . " Certainly ; that is why I know it , " return ##ed the Scarecrow . " If it required brains to figur ##e it out , I never should hav ##e said it . " After an hour or so the light faded away , and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness . Dorothy could not see at all , but Toto could , for some dogs see very well in the dark ; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day . So sh ##e took hold of his arm and manag ##ed to get along fairly well . " If you see any house , or any plac ##e where we can pass the night , " sh ##e said , " you must tell me ; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark . " Soon after the Scarecrow stopped . " I see a little cottag ##e at the right of us , " he said , " built of logs and branches . Shall we go there ? " " Yes , indeed , " answered the child . " I am all tired out . " So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reach ##ed the cottag ##e , and Dorothy enter ##ed and found a bed of dried leaves in on ##e corner . Sh ##e lay down at onc ##e , and with Toto besid ##e her soon fell into a sound sleep . The Scarecrow , who was never tired , stood up in another corner and wait ##ed patiently until morning cam ##e . 5 . The Rescu ##e of the Tin Woodman When Dorothy awok ##e the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels . Sh ##e sat up and look ##ed around her . Scarecrow , still standing patiently in his corner , waiting for her . " W ##e must go and search for water , " sh ##e said to him . " Why do you want water ? " he ask ##ed . " To wash my fac ##e clean after the dust of the road , and to drink , so the dry bread will not stick in my throat . " " It must be inconvenient to be mad ##e of flesh , " said the Scarecrow thoughtfully , " for you must sleep , and eat and drink . However , you hav ##e brains , and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly . " They left the cottag ##e and walk ##ed through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water , where Dorothy drank and bath ##ed and at ##e her breakfast . Sh ##e saw there was not much bread left in the basket , and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not hav ##e to eat anything , for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day . When sh ##e had finished her meal , and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick , sh ##e was startled to hear a deep groan near by . " What was that ? " sh ##e ask ##ed timidly . " I cannot imagin ##e , " replied the Scarecrow ; " but we can go and see . " Just then another groan reach ##ed their ears , and the sound seem ##ed to com ##e from behind them . They turn ##ed and walk ##ed through the forest a few steps , when Dorothy discover ##ed something shining in a ray of sunshin ##e that fell between the trees . Sh ##e ran to the plac ##e and then stopped short , with a little cry of surpris ##e . On ##e of the big trees had been partly chopped through , and standing besid ##e it , with an uplifted ax ##e in his hands , was a man mad ##e entirely of tin . His head and arms and legs wer ##e jointed upon his body , but he stood perf ##ect ##ly motionless , as if he could not stir at all . Dorothy look ##ed at him in amazement , and so did the Scarecrow , whil ##e Toto bark ##ed sharply and mad ##e a snap at the tin legs , which hurt his teeth . " Did you groan ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " Yes , " answered the tin man , " I did . I ' ve been groaning for mor ##e than a year , and no on ##e has ever heard me befor ##e or com ##e to help me . " " What can I do for you ? " sh ##e inquired softly , for sh ##e was mov ##ed by the sad voic ##e in which the man spok ##e . " Get an oil - can and oil my joints , " he answered . " They ar ##e rusted so badly that I cannot mov ##e them at all ; if I am well oil ##ed I shall soon be all right again . You will find an oil - can on a shelf in my cottag ##e . " Dorothy at onc ##e ran back to the cottag ##e and found the oil - can , and then sh ##e return ##ed and ask ##ed anxiously , " Wher ##e ar ##e your joints ? " " Oil my neck , first , " replied the Tin Woodman . So sh ##e oil ##ed it , and as it was quit ##e badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and mov ##ed it gently from sid ##e to sid ##e until it work ##ed freely , and then the man could turn it himself . " Now oil the joints in my arms , " he said . And Dorothy oil ##ed them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they wer ##e quit ##e free from rust and as good as new . The Tin Woodman gav ##e a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his ax ##e , which he leaned against the tre ##e . " This is a great comfort , " he said . " I hav ##e been holding that ax ##e in the air ever sinc ##e I rusted , and I ' m glad to be able to put it down at last . Now , if you will oil the joints of my legs , I shall be all right onc ##e mor ##e . " So they oil ##ed his legs until he could mov ##e them freely ; and he thank ##ed them again and again for his releas ##e , for he seem ##ed a very polit ##e creatur ##e , and very grateful . " I might hav ##e stood there always if you had not com ##e along , " he said ; " so you hav ##e certainly sav ##ed my lif ##e . How did you happen to be her ##e ? " " W ##e ar ##e on our way to the Emerald City to see the Gr ##e ##at Oz , " sh ##e answered , " and we stopped at your cottag ##e to pass the night . " " Why do you wish to see Oz ? " he ask ##ed . " I want him to send me back to Kansas , and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head , " sh ##e replied . The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment . Then he said : " Do you suppos ##e Oz could giv ##e me a heart ? " " Why , I guess so , " Dorothy answered . " It would be as easy as to giv ##e the Scarecrow brains . " " Tru ##e , " the Tin Woodman return ##ed . " So , if you will allow me to join your party , I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me . " " Com ##e along , " said the Scarecrow heartily , and Dorothy add ##ed that sh ##e would be pleas ##ed to hav ##e his company . So the Tin Woodman shouldered his ax ##e and they all pass ##ed through the forest until they cam ##e to the road that was paved with yellow brick . The Tin Woodman had ask ##ed Dorothy to put the oil - can in her basket . " For , " he said , " if I should get caught in the rain , and rust again , I would need the oil - can badly . " It was a bit of good luck to hav ##e their new comrad ##e join the party , for soon after they had begun their journey again they cam ##e to a plac ##e where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass . But the Tin Woodman set to work with his ax ##e and chopped so well that soon he clear ##ed a passag ##e for the entir ##e party . Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walk ##ed along that sh ##e did not notic ##e when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hol ##e and rolled over to the sid ##e of the road . Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again . " Why didn ' t you walk around the hol ##e ? " ask ##ed the Tin Woodman . " I don ' t know enough , " replied the Scarecrow cheerfully . " My head is stuff ##ed with straw , you know , and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains . " " Oh , I see , " said the Tin Woodman . " But , after all , brains ar ##e not the best things in the world . " " Hav ##e you any ? " inquired the Scarecrow . " No , my head is quit ##e empty , " answered the Woodman . " But onc ##e I had brains , and a heart also ; so , having tried them both , I should much rather hav ##e a heart . " " And why is that ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . " I will tell you my story , and then you will know . " So , whil ##e they wer ##e walking through the forest , the Tin Woodman told the following story : " I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living . When I grew up , I too becam ##e a woodchopper , and after my father di ##ed I took care of my old mother as long as sh ##e liv ##ed . Then I mad ##e up my mind that instead of living alon ##e I would marry , so that I might not becom ##e lonely . " There was on ##e of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to lov ##e her with all my heart . Sh ##e , on her part , promis ##ed to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her ; so I set to work harder than ever . But the girl liv ##ed with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyon ##e , for sh ##e was so lazy sh ##e wish ##ed the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework . So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East , and promis ##ed her two sheep and a cow if sh ##e would prevent the marriag ##e . Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchant ##ed my ax ##e , and when I was chopping away at my best on ##e day , for I was anxious to get the new house and my wif ##e as soon as possible , the ax ##e slipped all at onc ##e and cut off my left leg . " This at first seem ##ed a great misfortun ##e , for I knew a on ##e - legged man could not do very well as a wood - chopper . So I went to a tinsmith and had him mak ##e me a new leg out of tin . The leg work ##ed very well , onc ##e I was us ##ed to it . But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East , for sh ##e had promis ##ed the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl . When I began chopping again , my ax ##e slipped and cut off my right leg . Again I went to the tinsmith , and again he mad ##e me a leg out of tin . After this the enchant ##ed ax ##e cut off my arms , on ##e after the other ; but , nothing daunted , I had them replaced with tin ones . The Wicked Witch then mad ##e the ax ##e slip and cut off my head , and at first I thought that was the end of me . But the tinsmith happen ##ed to com ##e along , and he mad ##e me a new head out of tin . " I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then , and I work ##ed harder than ever ; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be . Sh ##e thought of a new way to kill my lov ##e for the beautiful Munchkin maiden , and mad ##e my ax ##e slip again , so that it cut right through my body , splitting me into two halves . Onc ##e mor ##e the tinsmith cam ##e to my help and mad ##e me a body of tin , fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it , by means of joints , so that I could mov ##e around as well as ever . But , alas ! I had now no heart , so that I lost all my lov ##e for the Munchkin girl , and did not care whether I married her or not . I suppos ##e sh ##e is still living with the old woman , waiting for me to com ##e after her . " My body shon ##e so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my ax ##e slipped , for it could not cut me . There was only on ##e danger - - that my joints would rust ; but I kept an oil - can in my cottag ##e and took care to oil myself whenever I need ##ed it . However , there cam ##e a day when I forgot to do this , and , being caught in a rainstorm , befor ##e I thought of the danger my joints had rusted , and I was left to stand in the woods until you cam ##e to help me . It was a terrible thing to undergo , but during the year I stood there I had tim ##e to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart . Whil ##e I was in lov ##e I was the happiest man on earth ; but no on ##e can lov ##e who has not a heart , and so I am resolved to ask Oz to giv ##e me on ##e . If he does , I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her . " Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman , and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart . " All the sam ##e , " said the Scarecrow , " I shall ask for brains instead of a heart ; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had on ##e . " " I shall tak ##e the heart , " return ##ed the Tin Woodman ; " for brains do not mak ##e on ##e happy , and happiness is the best thing in the world . " Dorothy did not say anything , for sh ##e was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right , and sh ##e decid ##ed if sh ##e could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em , it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart , or each got what he want ##ed . What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gon ##e , and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket . To be sur ##e neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever at ##e anything , but sh ##e was not mad ##e of tin nor straw , and could not liv ##e unless sh ##e was fed . 6 . The Cowardly Lion All this tim ##e Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods . The road was still paved with yellow brick , but thes ##e wer ##e much cover ##ed by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees , and the walking was not at all good . There wer ##e few birds in this part of the forest , for birds lov ##e the open country where there is plenty of sunshin ##e . But now and then there cam ##e a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees . Thes ##e sounds mad ##e the little girl ' s heart beat fast , for sh ##e did not know what mad ##e them ; but Toto knew , and he walk ##ed clos ##e to Dorothy ' s sid ##e , and did not even bark in return . " How long will it be , " the child ask ##ed of the Tin Woodman , " befor ##e we ar ##e out of the forest ? " " I cannot tell , " was the answer , " for I hav ##e never been to the Emerald City . But my father went there onc ##e , when I was a boy , and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country , although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful . But I am not afraid so long as I hav ##e my oil - can , and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow , whil ##e you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch ' s kiss , and that will protect you from harm . " " But Toto ! " said the girl anxiously . " What will protect him ? " " W ##e must protect him ourselves if he is in danger , " replied the Tin Woodman . Just as he spok ##e there cam ##e from the forest a terrible roar , and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road . With on ##e blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edg ##e of the road , and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws . But , to the Lion ' s surpris ##e , he could mak ##e no impression on the tin , although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still . Little Toto , now that he had an enemy to fac ##e , ran barking toward the Lion , and the great beast had open ##ed his mouth to bit ##e the dog , when Dorothy , fearing Toto would be killed , and heedless of danger , rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nos ##e as hard as sh ##e could , whil ##e sh ##e cried out : " Don ' t you dar ##e to bit ##e Toto ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself , a big beast lik ##e you , to bit ##e a poor little dog ! " " I didn ' t bit ##e him , " said the Lion , as he rubbed his nos ##e with his paw where Dorothy had hit it . " No , but you tried to , " sh ##e retorted . " You ar ##e nothing but a big coward . " " I know it , " said the Lion , hanging his head in sham ##e . " I ' ve always known it . But how can I help it ? " " I don ' t know , I ' m sur ##e . To think of your striking a stuff ##ed man , lik ##e the poor Scarecrow ! " " Is he stuff ##ed ? " ask ##ed the Lion in surpris ##e , as he watch ##ed her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet , whil ##e sh ##e patted him into shap ##e again . " Of course he ' s stuff ##ed , " replied Dorothy , who was still angry . " That ' s why he went over so easily , " remarked the Lion . " It astonished me to see him whirl around so . Is the other on ##e stuff ##ed also ? " " No , " said Dorothy , " he ' s mad ##e of tin . " And sh ##e help ##ed the Woodman up again . " That ' s why he nearly blunted my claws , " said the Lion . " When they scratch ##ed against the tin it mad ##e a cold shiver run down my back . What is that little animal you ar ##e so tender of ? " " H ##e is my dog , Toto , " answered Dorothy . " Is he mad ##e of tin , or stuff ##ed ? " ask ##ed the Lion . " Neither . H ##e ' s a - - a - - a meat dog , " said the girl . " Oh ! H ##e ' s a curious animal and seems remarkably small , now that I look at him . No on ##e would think of biting such a little thing , except a coward lik ##e me , " continu ##ed the Lion sadly . " What makes you a coward ? " ask ##ed Dorothy , looking at the great beast in wonder , for he was as big as a small horse . " It ' s a mystery , " replied the Lion . " I suppos ##e I was born that way . All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brav ##e , for the Lion is everywher ##e thought to be the King of Beasts . I learned that if I roar ##ed very loudly every living thing was frighten ##ed and got out of my way . Whenever I ' ve met a man I ' ve been awfully scar ##ed ; but I just roar ##ed at him , and he has always run away as fast as he could go . If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me , I should hav ##e run myself - - I ' m such a coward ; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me , and of course I let them go . " " But that isn ' t right . The King of Beasts shouldn ' t be a coward , " said the Scarecrow . " I know it , " return ##ed the Lion , wiping a tear from his ey ##e with the tip of his tail . " It is my great sorrow , and makes my lif ##e very unhappy . But whenever there is danger , my heart begins to beat fast . " " Perhaps you hav ##e heart diseas ##e , " said the Tin Woodman . " It may be , " said the Lion . " If you hav ##e , " continu ##ed the Tin Woodman , " you ought to be glad , for it proves you hav ##e a heart . For my part , I hav ##e no heart ; so I cannot hav ##e heart diseas ##e . " " Perhaps , " said the Lion thoughtfully , " if I had no heart I should not be a coward . " " Hav ##e you brains ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . " I suppos ##e so . I ' ve never look ##ed to see , " replied the Lion . " I am going to the Gr ##e ##at Oz to ask him to giv ##e me some , " remarked the Scarecrow , " for my head is stuff ##ed with straw . " " And I am going to ask him to giv ##e me a heart , " said the Woodman . " And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas , " add ##ed Dorothy . " Do you think Oz could giv ##e me courag ##e ? " ask ##ed the Cowardly Lion . " Just as easily as he could giv ##e me brains , " said the Scarecrow . " Or giv ##e me a heart , " said the Tin Woodman . " Or send me back to Kansas , " said Dorothy . " Then , if you don ' t mind , I ' ll go with you , " said the Lion , " for my lif ##e is simply unbearable without a bit of courag ##e . " " You will be very welcom ##e , " answered Dorothy , " for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts . It seems to me they must be mor ##e cowardly than you ar ##e if they allow you to scar ##e them so easily . " " They really ar ##e , " said the Lion , " but that doesn ' t mak ##e me any braver , and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy . " So onc ##e mor ##e the little company set off upon the journey , the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy ' s sid ##e . Toto did not approv ##e this new comrad ##e at first , for he could not forget how nearly he had been crush ##ed between the Lion ' s great jaws . But after a tim ##e he becam ##e mor ##e at eas ##e , and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends . During the rest of that day there was no other adventur ##e to mar the peac ##e of their journey . Onc ##e , indeed , the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road , and killed the poor little thing . This mad ##e the Tin Woodman very unhappy , for he was always careful not to hurt any living creatur ##e ; and as he walk ##ed along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret . Thes ##e tears ran slowly down his fac ##e and over the hinges of his jaw , and there they rusted . When Dorothy presently ask ##ed him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth , for his jaws wer ##e tightly rusted together . H ##e becam ##e greatly frighten ##ed at this and mad ##e many motions to Dorothy to reliev ##e him , but sh ##e could not understand . The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong . But the Scarecrow seiz ##ed the oil - can from Dorothy ' s basket and oil ##ed the Woodman ' s jaws , so that after a few moments he could talk as well as befor ##e . " This will serv ##e me a lesson , " said he , " to look where I step . For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again , and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak . " Thereafter he walk ##ed very carefully , with his eyes on the road , and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it , so as not to harm it . The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart , and therefor ##e he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything . " You people with hearts , " he said , " hav ##e something to guid ##e you , and need never do wrong ; but I hav ##e no heart , and so I must be very careful . When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn ' t mind so much . " 7 . The Journey to the Gr ##e ##at Oz They wer ##e obliged to camp out that night under a larg ##e tre ##e in the forest , for there wer ##e no houses near . The tre ##e mad ##e a good , thick covering to protect them from the dew , and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pil ##e of wood with his ax ##e and Dorothy built a splendid fir ##e that warm ##ed her and mad ##e her feel less lonely . Sh ##e and Toto at ##e the last of their bread , and now sh ##e did not know what they would do for breakfast . " If you wish , " said the Lion , " I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you . You can roast it by the fir ##e , sinc ##e your tastes ar ##e so peculiar that you prefer cooked food , and then you will hav ##e a very good breakfast . " " Don ' t ! Pleas ##e don ' t , " begged the Tin Woodman . " I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer , and then my jaws would rust again . " But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper , and no on ##e ever knew what it was , for he didn ' t mention it . And the Scarecrow found a tre ##e full of nuts and fill ##ed Dorothy ' s basket with them , so that sh ##e would not be hungry for a long tim ##e . Sh ##e thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow , but sh ##e laugh ##ed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creatur ##e pick ##ed up the nuts . His padded hands wer ##e so clumsy and the nuts wer ##e so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket . But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket , for it enabled him to keep away from the fir ##e , as he fear ##ed a spark might get into his straw and burn him up . So he kept a good distanc ##e away from the flames , and only cam ##e near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when sh ##e lay down to sleep . Thes ##e kept her very snug and warm , and sh ##e slept soundly until morning . When it was daylight , the girl bath ##ed her fac ##e in a little rippling brook , and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City . This was to be an eventful day for the travelers . They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw befor ##e them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either sid ##e . It was a very wid ##e ditch , and when they crept up to the edg ##e and look ##ed into it they could see it was also very deep , and there wer ##e many big , jagged rocks at the bottom . The sides wer ##e so steep that non ##e of them could climb down , and for a moment it seem ##ed that their journey must end . " What shall we do ? " ask ##ed Dorothy despairingly . " I haven ' t the faintest id ##e ##a , " said the Tin Woodman , and the Lion shook his shaggy man ##e and look ##ed thoughtful . But the Scarecrow said , " W ##e cannot fly , that is certain . Neither can we climb down into this great ditch . Therefor ##e , if we cannot jump over it , we must stop where we ar ##e . " " I think I could jump over it , " said the Cowardly Lion , after measuring the distanc ##e carefully in his mind . " Then we ar ##e all right , " answered the Scarecrow , " for you can carry us all over on your back , on ##e at a tim ##e . " " Well , I ' ll try it , " said the Lion . " Who will go first ? " " I will , " declared the Scarecrow , " for , if you found that you could not jump over the gulf , Dorothy would be killed , or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below . But if I am on your back it will not matter so much , for the fall would not hurt me at all . " " I am terribly afraid of falling , myself , " said the Cowardly Lion , " but I suppos ##e there is nothing to do but try it . So get on my back and we will mak ##e the att ##em ##p ##t . " The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion ' s back , and the big beast walk ##ed to the edg ##e of the gulf and crouched down . " Why don ' t you run and jump ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . " Because that isn ' t the way we Lions do thes ##e things , " he replied . Then giving a great spring , he shot through the air and land ##ed safely on the other sid ##e . They wer ##e all greatly pleas ##ed to see how easily he did it , and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again . Dorothy thought sh ##e would go next ; so sh ##e took Toto in her arms and climb ##ed on the Lion ' s back , holding tightly to his man ##e with on ##e hand . The next moment it seem ##ed as if sh ##e wer ##e flying through the air ; and then , befor ##e sh ##e had tim ##e to think about it , sh ##e was saf ##e on the other sid ##e . The Lion went back a third tim ##e and got the Tin Woodman , and then they all sat down for a few moments to giv ##e the beast a chanc ##e to rest , for his great leaps had mad ##e his breath short , and he panted lik ##e a big dog that has been running too long . They found the forest very thick on this sid ##e , and it look ##ed dark and gloomy . After the Lion had rest ##ed they started along the road of yellow brick , silently wondering , each in his own mind , if ever they would com ##e to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshin ##e again . To add to their discomfort , they soon heard strang ##e noises in the depths of the forest , and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs liv ##ed . " What ar ##e the Kalidahs ? " ask ##ed the girl . " They ar ##e monstrous beasts with bodies lik ##e bears and heads lik ##e tigers , " replied the Lion , " and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto . I ' m terribly afraid of the Kalidahs . " " I ' m not surpris ##ed that you ar ##e , " return ##ed Dorothy . " They must be dreadful beasts . " The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they cam ##e to another gulf across the road . But this on ##e was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at onc ##e he could not leap across it . So they sat down to consider what they should do , and after serious thought the Scarecrow said : " Her ##e is a great tre ##e , standing clos ##e to the ditch . If the Tin Woodman can chop it down , so that it will fall to the other sid ##e , we can walk across it easily . " " That is a first - rat ##e id ##e ##a , " said the Lion . " On ##e would almost suspect you had brains in your head , instead of straw . " The Woodman set to work at onc ##e , and so sharp was his ax ##e that the tre ##e was soon chopped nearly through . Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tre ##e and push ##ed with all his might , and slowly the big tre ##e tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch , with its top branches on the other sid ##e . They had just started to cross this queer bridg ##e when a sharp growl mad ##e them all look up , and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies lik ##e bears and heads lik ##e tigers . " They ar ##e the Kalidahs ! " said the Cowardly Lion , beginning to tremble . " Quick ! " cried the Scarecrow . " Let us cross over . " So Dorothy went first , holding Toto in her arms , the Tin Woodman follow ##ed , and the Scarecrow cam ##e next . The Lion , although he was certainly afraid , turn ##ed to fac ##e the Kalidahs , and then he gav ##e so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy scream ##ed and the Scarecrow fell over backward , whil ##e even the fierc ##e beasts stopped short and look ##ed at him in surpris ##e . But , seeing they wer ##e bigger than the Lion , and remembering that there wer ##e two of them and only on ##e of him , the Kalidahs again rushed forward , and the Lion crossed over the tre ##e and turn ##ed to see what they would do next . Without stopping an instant the fierc ##e beasts also began to cross the tre ##e . And the Lion said to Dorothy : " W ##e ar ##e lost , for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws . But stand clos ##e behind me , and I will fight them as long as I am aliv ##e . " " Wait a minut ##e ! " call ##ed the Scarecrow . H ##e had been thinking what was best to be don ##e , and now he ask ##ed the Woodman to chop away the end of the tre ##e that rest ##ed on their sid ##e of the ditch . The Tin Woodman began to us ##e his ax ##e at onc ##e , and , just as the two Kalidahs wer ##e nearly across , the tre ##e fell with a crash into the gulf , carrying the ugly , snarling brutes with it , and both wer ##e dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom . " Well , " said the Cowardly Lion , drawing a long breath of relief , " I see we ar ##e going to liv ##e a little whil ##e longer , and I am glad of it , for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be aliv ##e . Thos ##e creatures frighten ##ed me so badly that my heart is beating yet . " " Ah , " said the Tin Woodman sadly , " I wish I had a heart to beat . " This adventur ##e mad ##e the travelers mor ##e anxious than ever to get out of the forest , and they walk ##ed so fast that Dorothy becam ##e tired , and had to rid ##e on the Lion ' s back . To their great joy the trees becam ##e thinner the farther they advanced , and in the afternoon they suddenly cam ##e upon a broad river , flowing swiftly just befor ##e them . On the other sid ##e of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country , with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits . They wer ##e greatly pleas ##ed to see this delightful country befor ##e them . " How shall we cross the river ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " That is easily don ##e , " replied the Scarecrow . " The Tin Woodman must build us a raft , so we can float to the other sid ##e . " So the Woodman took his ax ##e and began to chop down small trees to mak ##e a raft , and whil ##e he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tre ##e full of fin ##e fruit . This pleas ##ed Dorothy , who had eaten nothing but nuts all day , and sh ##e mad ##e a hearty meal of the rip ##e fruit . But it takes tim ##e to mak ##e a raft , even when on ##e is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman , and when night cam ##e the work was not don ##e . So they found a cozy plac ##e under the trees where they slept well until the morning ; and Dorothy dream ##ed of the Emerald City , and of the good Wizard Oz , who would soon send her back to her own hom ##e again . 8 . The Deadly Poppy Field Our little party of travelers awaken ##ed the next morning refreshed and full of hop ##e , and Dorothy breakfast ##ed lik ##e a princess off peaches and plums from the trees besid ##e the river . Behind them was the dark forest they had pass ##ed safely through , although they had suffered many discouragements ; but befor ##e them was a lovely , sunny country that seem ##ed to beckon them on to the Emerald City . To be sur ##e , the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land . But the raft was nearly don ##e , and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few mor ##e logs and fasten ##ed them together with wooden pins , they wer ##e ready to start . Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms . When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly , for he was big and heavy ; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it , and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water . They got along quit ##e well at first , but when they reach ##ed the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream , farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick . And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom . " This is bad , " said the Tin Woodman , " for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West , and sh ##e will enchant us and mak ##e us her slaves . " " And then I should get no brains , " said the Scarecrow . " And I should get no courag ##e , " said the Cowardly Lion . " And I should get no heart , " said the Tin Woodman . " And I should never get back to Kansas , " said Dorothy . " W ##e must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can , " the Scarecrow continu ##ed , and he push ##ed so hard on his long pol ##e that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river . Then , befor ##e he could pull it out again - - or let go - - the raft was swept away , and the poor Scarecrow left clinging to the pol ##e in the middle of the river . " Good - by ##e ! " he call ##ed after them , and they wer ##e very sorry to leav ##e him . Indeed , the Tin Woodman began to cry , but fortunately remembered that he might rust , and so dried his tears on Dorothy ' s apron . Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow . " I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy , " he thought . " Then , I was stuck on a pol ##e in a cornfield , where I could mak ##e - believ ##e scar ##e the crows , at any rat ##e . But surely there is no us ##e for a Scarecrow stuck on a pol ##e in the middle of a river . I am afraid I shall never hav ##e any brains , after all ! " Down the stream the raft float ##ed , and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind . Then the Lion said : " Something must be don ##e to sav ##e us . I think I can swim to the shor ##e and pull the raft after me , if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail . " So he sprang into the water , and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail . Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shor ##e . It was hard work , although he was so big ; but by and by they wer ##e drawn out of the current , and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman ' s long pol ##e and help ##ed push the raft to the land . They wer ##e all tired out when they reach ##ed the shor ##e at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass , and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City . " What shall we do now ? " ask ##ed the Tin Woodman , as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him . " W ##e must get back to the road , in some way , " said Dorothy . " The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we com ##e to the road again , " remarked the Lion . So , when they wer ##e rest ##ed , Dorothy pick ##ed up her basket and they started along the grassy bank , to the road from which the river had carried them . It was a lovely country , with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshin ##e to cheer them , and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow , they could hav ##e been very happy . They walk ##ed along as fast as they could , Dorothy only stopping onc ##e to pick a beautiful flower ; and after a tim ##e the Tin Woodman cried out : " Look ! " Then they all look ##ed at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pol ##e in the middle of the water , looking very lonely and sad . " What can we do to sav ##e him ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads , for they did not know . So they sat down upon the bank and gaz ##ed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by , who , upon seeing them , stopped to rest at the water ' s edg ##e . " Who ar ##e you and where ar ##e you going ? " ask ##ed the Stork . " I am Dorothy , " answered the girl , " and thes ##e ar ##e my friends , the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion ; and we ar ##e going to the Emerald City . " " This isn ' t the road , " said the Stork , as sh ##e twisted her long neck and look ##ed sharply at the queer party . " I know it , " return ##ed Dorothy , " but we hav ##e lost the Scarecrow , and ar ##e wondering how we shall get him again . " " Wher ##e is he ? " ask ##ed the Stork . " Over there in the river , " answered the little girl . " If he wasn ' t so big and heavy I would get him for you , " remarked the Stork . " H ##e isn ' t heavy a bit , " said Dorothy eagerly , " for he is stuff ##ed with straw ; and if you will bring him back to us , we shall thank you ever and ever so much . " " Well , I ' ll try , " said the Stork , " but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall hav ##e to drop him in the river again . " So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till sh ##e cam ##e to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pol ##e . Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank , where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto wer ##e sitting . When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again , he was so happy that he hugged them all , even the Lion and Toto ; and as they walk ##ed along he sang " Tol - de - ri - de - oh ! " at every step , he felt so gay . " I was afraid I should hav ##e to stay in the river forever , " he said , " but the kind Stork sav ##ed me , and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return . " " That ' s all right , " said the Stork , who was flying along besid ##e them . " I always lik ##e to help anyon ##e in trouble . But I must go now , for my babies ar ##e waiting in the nest for me . I hop ##e you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you . " " Thank you , " replied Dorothy , and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight . They walk ##ed along listening to the singing of the brightly color ##ed birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now becam ##e so thick that the ground was carpet ##ed with them . There wer ##e big yellow and whit ##e and blu ##e and purple blossoms , besides great clusters of scarlet poppies , which wer ##e so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy ' s eyes . " Aren ' t they beautiful ? " the girl ask ##ed , as sh ##e breath ##ed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers . " I suppos ##e so , " answered the Scarecrow . " When I hav ##e brains , I shall probably lik ##e them better . " " If I only had a heart , I should lov ##e them , " add ##ed the Tin Woodman . " I always did lik ##e flowers , " said the Lion . " They of seem so helpless and frail . But there ar ##e non ##e in the forest so bright as thes ##e . " They now cam ##e upon mor ##e and mor ##e of the big scarlet poppies , and fewer and fewer of the other flowers ; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies . Now it is well known that when there ar ##e many of thes ##e flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyon ##e who breathes it falls asleep , and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers , he sleeps on and on forever . But Dorothy did not know this , nor could sh ##e get away from the bright red flowers that wer ##e everywher ##e about ; so presently her eyes grew heavy and sh ##e felt sh ##e must sit down to rest and to sleep . But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this . " W ##e must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick befor ##e dark , " he said ; and the Scarecrow agreed with him . So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer . Her eyes clos ##ed in spit ##e of herself and sh ##e forgot where sh ##e was and fell among the poppies , fast asleep . " What shall we do ? " ask ##ed the Tin Woodman . " If we leav ##e her her ##e sh ##e will di ##e , " said the Lion . " The smell of the flowers is killing us all . I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open , and the dog is asleep already . " It was tru ##e ; Toto had fallen down besid ##e his little mistress . But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman , not being mad ##e of flesh , wer ##e not troubled by the scent of the flowers . " Run fast , " said the Scarecrow to the Lion , " and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can . W ##e will bring the little girl with us , but if you should fall asleep you ar ##e too big to be carried . " So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go . In a moment he was out of sight . " Let us mak ##e a chair with our hands and carry her , " said the Scarecrow . So they pick ##ed up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy ' s lap , and then they mad ##e a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers . On and on they walk ##ed , and it seem ##ed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end . They follow ##ed the bend of the river , and at last cam ##e upon their friend the Lion , lying fast asleep among the poppies . The flowers had been too strong for the hug ##e beast and he had given up at last , and fallen only a short distanc ##e from the end of the poppy bed , where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields befor ##e them . " W ##e can do nothing for him , " said the Tin Woodman , sadly ; " for he is much too heavy to lift . W ##e must leav ##e him her ##e to sleep on forever , and perhaps he will dream that he has found courag ##e at last . " " I ' m sorry , " said the Scarecrow . " The Lion was a very good comrad ##e for on ##e so cowardly . But let us go on . " They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot besid ##e the river , far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any mor ##e of the poison of the flowers , and her ##e they laid her gently on the soft grass and wait ##ed for the fresh breez ##e to waken her . 9 . The Queen of the Field Mic ##e " W ##e cannot be far from the road of yellow brick , now , " remarked the Scarecrow , as he stood besid ##e the girl , " for we hav ##e com ##e nearly as far as the river carried us away . " The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl , and turning his head ( which work ##ed beautifully on hinges ) he saw a strang ##e beast com ##e bounding over the grass toward them . It was , indeed , a great yellow Wildcat , and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something , for its ears wer ##e lying clos ##e to its head and its mouth was wid ##e open , showing two rows of ugly teeth , whil ##e its red eyes glow ##ed lik ##e balls of fir ##e . As it cam ##e nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running befor ##e the beast was a little gray field mous ##e , and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty , harmless creatur ##e . So the Woodman rais ##ed his ax ##e , and as the Wildcat ran by he gav ##e it a quick blow that cut the beast ' s head clean off from its body , and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces . The field mous ##e , now that it was freed from its enemy , stopped short ; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said , in a squ ##e ##aky little voic ##e : " Oh , thank you ! Thank you ever so much for saving my lif ##e . " " Don ' t speak of it , I beg of you , " replied the Woodman . " I hav ##e no heart , you know , so I am careful to help all thos ##e who may need a friend , even if it happens to be only a mous ##e . " " Only a mous ##e ! " cried the little animal , indignantly . " Why , I am a Queen - - the Queen of all the Field Mic ##e ! " " Oh , indeed , " said the Woodman , making a bow . " Therefor ##e you hav ##e don ##e a great de ##ed , as well as a brav ##e on ##e , in saving my lif ##e , " add ##ed the Queen . At that moment several mic ##e wer ##e seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them , and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed : " Oh , your Majesty , we thought you would be killed ! How did you manag ##e to escap ##e the great Wildcat ? " They all bow ##ed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads . " This funny tin man , " sh ##e answered , " killed the Wildcat and sav ##ed my lif ##e . So hereafter you must all serv ##e him , and obey his slightest wish . " " W ##e will ! " cried all the mic ##e , in a shrill chorus . And then they scampered in all directions , for Toto had awaken ##ed from his sleep , and seeing all thes ##e mic ##e around him he gav ##e on ##e bark of delight and jump ##ed right into the middle of the group . Toto had always lov ##ed to chas ##e mic ##e when he liv ##ed in Kansas , and he saw no harm in it . But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight , whil ##e he call ##ed to the mic ##e , " Com ##e back ! Com ##e back ! Toto shall not hurt you . " At this the Queen of the Mic ##e stuck her head out from undern ##e ##ath a clump of grass and ask ##ed , in a timid voic ##e , " Ar ##e you sur ##e he will not bit ##e us ? " " I will not let him , " said the Woodman ; " so do not be afraid . " On ##e by on ##e the mic ##e cam ##e creeping back , and Toto did not bark again , although he tried to get out of the Woodman ' s arms , and would hav ##e bitten him had he not known very well he was mad ##e of tin . Finally on ##e of the biggest mic ##e spok ##e . " Is there anything we can do , " it ask ##ed , " to repay you for saving the lif ##e of our Queen ? " " Nothing that I know of , " answered the Woodman ; but the Scarecrow , who had been trying to think , but could not because his head was stuff ##ed with straw , said , quickly , " Oh , yes ; you can sav ##e our friend , the Cowardly Lion , who is asleep in the poppy bed . " " A Lion ! " cried the little Queen . " Why , he would eat us all up . " " Oh , no , " declared the Scarecrow ; " this Lion is a coward . " " R ##e ##ally ? " ask ##ed the Mous ##e . " H ##e says so himself , " answered the Scarecrow , " and he would never hurt anyon ##e who is our friend . If you will help us to sav ##e him I promis ##e that he shall treat you all with kindness . " " Very well , " said the Queen , " we trust you . But what shall we do ? " " Ar ##e there many of thes ##e mic ##e which call you Queen and ar ##e willing to obey you ? " " Oh , yes ; there ar ##e thousands , " sh ##e replied . " Then send for them all to com ##e her ##e as soon as possible , and let each on ##e bring a long piec ##e of string . " The Queen turn ##ed to the mic ##e that attended her and told them to go at onc ##e and get all her people . As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible . " Now , " said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman , " you must go to thos ##e trees by the riversid ##e and mak ##e a truck that will carry the Lion . " So the Woodman went at onc ##e to the trees and began to work ; and he soon mad ##e a truck out of the limbs of trees , from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches . H ##e fasten ##ed it together with wooden pegs and mad ##e the four wh ##ee ##l ##s out of short pieces of a big tre ##e trunk . So fast and so well did he work that by the tim ##e the mic ##e began to arriv ##e the truck was all ready for them . They cam ##e from all directions , and there wer ##e thousands of them : big mic ##e and little mic ##e and middle - siz ##ed mic ##e ; and each on ##e brought a piec ##e of string in his mouth . It was about this tim ##e that Dorothy wok ##e from her long sleep and open ##ed her eyes . Sh ##e was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass , with thousands of mic ##e standing around and looking at her timidly . But the Scarecrow told her about everything , and turning to the dignified little Mous ##e , he said : " Permit me to introduc ##e to you her Majesty , the Queen . " Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen mad ##e a curtsy , after which sh ##e becam ##e quit ##e friendly with the little girl . The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mic ##e to the truck , using the strings they had brought . On ##e end of a string was tied around the neck of each mous ##e and the other end to the truck . Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mic ##e who wer ##e to draw it ; but when all the mic ##e had been harness ##ed , they wer ##e able to pull it quit ##e easily . Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it , and wer ##e drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the plac ##e where the Lion lay asleep . After a great deal of hard work , for the Lion was heavy , they manag ##ed to get him up on the truck . Then the Queen hurriedly gav ##e her people the order to start , for sh ##e fear ##ed if the mic ##e stay ##ed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep . At first the little creatures , many though they wer ##e , could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck ; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both push ##ed from behind , and they got along better . Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields , where he could breath ##e the sweet , fresh air again , instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers . Dorothy cam ##e to meet them and thank ##ed the little mic ##e warmly for saving her companion from death . Sh ##e had grown so fond of the big Lion sh ##e was glad he had been rescu ##ed . Then the mic ##e wer ##e unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes . The Queen of the Mic ##e was the last to leav ##e . " If ever you need us again , " sh ##e said , " com ##e out into the field and call , and we shall hear you and com ##e to your assistanc ##e . Good - by ##e ! " " Good - by ##e ! " they all answered , and away the Queen ran , whil ##e Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her . After this they sat down besid ##e the Lion until he should awaken ; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tre ##e near by , which sh ##e at ##e for her dinner . 10 . The Guardian of the Gat ##e It was some tim ##e befor ##e the Cowardly Lion awaken ##ed , for he had lain among the poppies a long whil ##e , breathing in their deadly fragranc ##e ; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still aliv ##e . " I ran as fast as I could , " he said , sitting down and yawning , " but the flowers wer ##e too strong for me . How did you get me out ? " Then they told him of the field mic ##e , and how they had generously sav ##ed him from death ; and the Cowardly Lion laugh ##ed , and said : " I hav ##e always thought myself very big and terrible ; yet such little things as flowers cam ##e near to killing me , and such small animals as mic ##e hav ##e sav ##ed my lif ##e . How strang ##e it all is ! But , comrades , what shall we do now ? " " W ##e must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again , " said Dorothy , " and then we can keep on to the Emerald City . " So , the Lion being fully refreshed , and feeling quit ##e himself again , they all started upon the journey , greatly enjoying the walk through the soft , fresh grass ; and it was not long befor ##e they reach ##ed the road of yellow brick and turn ##ed again toward the Emerald City where the Gr ##e ##at Oz dwelt . The road was smooth and well paved , now , and the country about was beautiful , so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind , and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades . Onc ##e mor ##e they could see fences built besid ##e the road ; but thes ##e wer ##e painted green , and when they cam ##e to a small house , in which a farmer evidently liv ##ed , that also was painted green . They pass ##ed by several of thes ##e houses during the afternoon , and sometimes people cam ##e to the doors and look ##ed at them as if they would lik ##e to ask questions ; but no on ##e cam ##e near them nor spok ##e to them because of the great Lion , of which they wer ##e very much afraid . The people wer ##e all dress ##ed in clothing of a lovely emerald - green color and wor ##e peaked hats lik ##e thos ##e of the Munchkins . " This must be the Land of Oz , " said Dorothy , " and we ar ##e surely getting near the Emerald City . " " Yes , " answered the Scarecrow . " Everything is green her ##e , whil ##e in the country of the Munchkins blu ##e was the favorit ##e color . But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins , and I ' m afraid we shall be unable to find a plac ##e to pass the night . " " I should lik ##e something to eat besides fruit , " said the girl , " and I ' m sur ##e Toto is nearly starv ##ed . Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people . " So , when they cam ##e to a good - siz ##ed farmhous ##e , Dorothy walk ##ed boldly up to the door and knock ##ed . A woman open ##ed it just far enough to look out , and said , " What do you want , child , and why is that great Lion with you ? " " W ##e wish to pass the night with you , if you will allow us , " answered Dorothy ; " and the Lion is my friend and comrad ##e , and would not hurt you for the world . " " Is he tam ##e ? " ask ##ed the woman , opening the door a little wider . " Oh , yes , " said the girl , " and he is a great coward , too . H ##e will be mor ##e afraid of you than you ar ##e of him . " " Well , " said the woman , after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion , " if that is the cas ##e you may com ##e in , and I will giv ##e you some supper and a plac ##e to sleep . " So they all enter ##ed the house , where there wer ##e , besides the woman , two children and a man . The man had hurt his leg , and was lying on the couch in a corner . They seem ##ed greatly surpris ##ed to see so strang ##e a company , and whil ##e the woman was busy laying the table the man ask ##ed : " Wher ##e ar ##e you all going ? " " To the Emerald City , " said Dorothy , " to see the Gr ##e ##at Oz . " " Oh , indeed ! " exclaimed the man . " Ar ##e you sur ##e that Oz will see you ? " " Why not ? " sh ##e replied . " Why , it is said that he never lets anyon ##e com ##e into his presenc ##e . I hav ##e been to the Emerald City many times , and it is a beautiful and wonderful plac ##e ; but I hav ##e never been permitted to see the Gr ##e ##at Oz , nor do I know of any living person who has seen him . " " Does he never go out ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . " Never . H ##e sits day after day in the great Thron ##e Room of his Palac ##e , and even thos ##e who wait upon him do not see him fac ##e to fac ##e . " " What is he lik ##e ? " ask ##ed the girl . " That is hard to tell , " said the man thoughtfully . " You see , Oz is a Gr ##e ##at Wizard , and can tak ##e on any form he wishes . So that some say he looks lik ##e a bird ; and some say he looks lik ##e an elephant ; and some say he looks lik ##e a cat . To others he appears as a beautiful fairy , or a browni ##e , or in any other form that pleases him . But who the real Oz is , when he is in his own form , no living person can tell . " " That is very strang ##e , " said Dorothy , " but we must try , in some way , to see him , or we shall hav ##e mad ##e our journey for nothing . " " Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz ? " ask ##ed the man . " I want him to giv ##e me some brains , " said the Scarecrow eagerly . " Oh , Oz could do that easily enough , " declared the man . " H ##e has mor ##e brains than he needs . " " And I want him to giv ##e me a heart , " said the Tin Woodman . " That will not trouble him , " continu ##ed the man , " for Oz has a larg ##e collection of hearts , of all sizes and shapes . " " And I want him to giv ##e me courag ##e , " said the Cowardly Lion . " Oz keeps a great pot of courag ##e in his Thron ##e Room , " said the man , " which he has cover ##ed with a golden plat ##e , to keep it from running over . H ##e will be glad to giv ##e you some . " " And I want him to send me back to Kansas , " said Dorothy . " Wher ##e is Kansas ? " ask ##ed the man , with surpris ##e . " I don ' t know , " replied Dorothy sorrowfully , " but it is my hom ##e , and I ' m sur ##e it ' s somewher ##e . " " Very likely . Well , Oz can do anything ; so I suppos ##e he will find Kansas for you . But first you must get to see him , and that will be a hard task ; for the Gr ##e ##at Wizard does not lik ##e to see anyon ##e , and he usually has his own way . But what do YOU want ? " he continu ##ed , speaking to Toto . Toto only wagged his tail ; for , strang ##e to say , he could not speak . The woman now call ##ed to them that supper was ready , so they gathered around the table and Dorothy at ##e some delicious porridg ##e and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plat ##e of nic ##e whit ##e bread , and enjoyed her meal . The Lion at ##e some of the porridg ##e , but did not care for it , saying it was mad ##e from oats and oats wer ##e food for horses , not for lions . The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman at ##e nothing at all . Toto at ##e a little of everything , and was glad to get a good supper again . The woman now gav ##e Dorothy a bed to sleep in , and Toto lay down besid ##e her , whil ##e the Lion guard ##ed the door of her room so sh ##e might not be disturbed . The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night , although of course they could not sleep . The next morning , as soon as the sun was up , they started on their way , and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just befor ##e them . " That must be the Emerald City , " said Dorothy . As they walk ##ed on , the green glow becam ##e brighter and brighter , and it seem ##ed that at last they wer ##e nearing the end of their travels . Yet it was afternoon befor ##e they cam ##e to the great wall that surrounded the City . It was high and thick and of a bright green color . In front of them , and at the end of the road of yellow brick , was a big gat ##e , all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow wer ##e dazzled by their brilliancy . There was a bell besid ##e the gat ##e , and Dorothy push ##ed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within . Then the big gat ##e swung slowly open , and they all pass ##ed through and found themselves in a high arched room , the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds . Befor ##e them stood a little man about the sam ##e siz ##e as the Munchkins . H ##e was cloth ##ed all in green , from his head to his feet , and even his skin was of a greenish tint . At his sid ##e was a larg ##e green box . When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man ask ##ed , " What do you wish in the Emerald City ? " " W ##e cam ##e her ##e to see the Gr ##e ##at Oz , " said Dorothy . The man was so surpris ##ed at this answer that he sat down to think it over . " It has been many years sinc ##e anyon ##e ask ##ed me to see Oz , " he said , shaking his head in perplexity . " H ##e is powerful and terrible , and if you com ##e on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wis ##e reflections of the Gr ##e ##at Wizard , he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant . " " But it is not a foolish errand , nor an idle on ##e , " replied the Scarecrow ; " it is important . And we hav ##e been told that Oz is a good Wizard . " " So he is , " said the green man , " and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well . But to thos ##e who ar ##e not honest , or who approach him from curiosity , he is most terrible , and few hav ##e ever dar ##ed ask to see his fac ##e . I am the Guardian of the Gates , and sinc ##e you demand to see the Gr ##e ##at Oz I must tak ##e you to his Palac ##e . But first you must put on the spectacles . " " Why ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you . Even thos ##e who liv ##e in the City must wear spectacles night and day . They ar ##e all locked on , for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built , and I hav ##e the only key that will unlock them . " H ##e open ##ed the big box , and Dorothy saw that it was fill ##ed with spectacles of every siz ##e and shap ##e . All of them had green glasses in them . The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes . There wer ##e two golden bands fasten ##ed to them that pass ##ed around the back of her head , where they wer ##e locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wor ##e around his neck . When they wer ##e on , Dorothy could not tak ##e them off had sh ##e wish ##ed , but of course sh ##e did not wish to be blind ##ed by the glar ##e of the Emerald City , so sh ##e said nothing . Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion , and even on little Toto ; and all wer ##e locked fast with the key . Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palac ##e . Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall , he open ##ed another gat ##e , and they all follow ##ed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City . 11 . The Wonderful City of Oz Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles , Dorothy and her friends wer ##e at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City . The streets wer ##e lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywher ##e with sparkling emeralds . They walk ##ed over a pavement of the sam ##e green marble , and where the blocks wer ##e join ##ed together wer ##e rows of emeralds , set closely , and glittering in the brightness of the sun . The window panes wer ##e of green glass ; even the sky abov ##e the City had a green tint , and the rays of the sun wer ##e green . There wer ##e many people - - men , women , and children - - walking about , and thes ##e wer ##e all dress ##ed in green clothes and had greenish skins . They look ##ed at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes , and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion ; but no on ##e spok ##e to them . Many shops stood in the street , and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green . Green candy and green pop corn wer ##e offered for sal ##e , as well as green shoes , green hats , and green clothes of all sorts . At on ##e plac ##e a man was selling green lemonad ##e , and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies . There seem ##ed to be no horses nor animals of any kind ; the men carried things around in little green carts , which they push ##ed befor ##e them . Everyon ##e seem ##ed happy and content ##ed and prosperous . The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they cam ##e to a big building , exactly in the middle of the City , which was the Palac ##e of Oz , the Gr ##e ##at Wizard . There was a soldier befor ##e the door , dress ##ed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard . " Her ##e ar ##e strangers , " said the Guardian of the Gates to him , " and they demand to see the Gr ##e ##at Oz . " " Step insid ##e , " answered the soldier , " and I will carry your messag ##e to him . " So they pass ##ed through the Palac ##e Gates and wer ##e led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furnitur ##e set with emeralds . The soldier mad ##e them all wip ##e their feet upon a green mat befor ##e entering this room , and when they wer ##e seat ##ed he said politely : " Pleas ##e mak ##e yourselves comfortable whil ##e I go to the door of the Thron ##e Room and tell Oz you ar ##e her ##e . " They had to wait a long tim ##e befor ##e the soldier return ##ed . When , at last , he cam ##e back , Dorothy ask ##ed : " Hav ##e you seen Oz ? " " Oh , no , " return ##ed the soldier ; " I hav ##e never seen him . But I spok ##e to him as he sat behind his screen and gav ##e him your messag ##e . H ##e said he will grant you an audienc ##e , if you so desir ##e ; but each on ##e of you must enter his presenc ##e alon ##e , and he will admit but on ##e each day . Therefor ##e , as you must remain in the Palac ##e for several days , I will hav ##e you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey . " " Thank you , " replied the girl ; " that is very kind of Oz . " The soldier now blew upon a green whistle , and at onc ##e a young girl , dress ##ed in a pretty green silk gown , enter ##ed the room . Sh ##e had lovely green hair and green eyes , and sh ##e bow ##ed low befor ##e Dorothy as sh ##e said , " Follow me and I will show you your room . " So Dorothy said good - by ##e to all her friends except Toto , and taking the dog in her arms follow ##ed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they cam ##e to a room at the front of the Palac ##e . It was the sweetest little room in the world , with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpan ##e . There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room , that shot a spray of green perfum ##e into the air , to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin . Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows , and there was a shelf with a row of little green books . When Dorothy had tim ##e to open thes ##e books sh ##e found them full of queer green pictures that mad ##e her laugh , they wer ##e so funny . In a wardrob ##e wer ##e many green dresses , mad ##e of silk and satin and velvet ; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly . " Mak ##e yourself perf ##ect ##ly at hom ##e , " said the green girl , " and if you wish for anything ring the bell . Oz will send for you tomorrow morning . " Sh ##e left Dorothy alon ##e and went back to the others . Thes ##e sh ##e also led to rooms , and each on ##e of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palac ##e . Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow ; for when he found himself alon ##e in his room he stood stupidly in on ##e spot , just within the doorway , to wait till morning . It would not rest him to li ##e down , and he could not clos ##e his eyes ; so he remain ##ed all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room , just as if it wer ##e not on ##e of the most wonderful rooms in the world . The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from forc ##e of habit , for he remembered when he was mad ##e of flesh ; but not being able to sleep , he pass ##ed the night moving his joints up and down to mak ##e sur ##e they kept in good working order . The Lion would hav ##e preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest , and did not lik ##e being shut up in a room ; but he had too much sense to let this worry him , so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up lik ##e a cat and purred himself asleep in a minut ##e . The next morning , after breakfast , the green maiden cam ##e to fetch Dorothy , and sh ##e dress ##ed her in on ##e of the prettiest gowns , mad ##e of green brocaded satin . Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto ' s neck , and they started for the Thron ##e Room of the Gr ##e ##at Oz . First they cam ##e to a great hall in which wer ##e many ladies and gentlemen of the court , all dress ##ed in rich costumes . Thes ##e people had nothing to do but talk to each other , but they always cam ##e to wait outsid ##e the Thron ##e Room every morning , although they wer ##e never permitted to see Oz . As Dorothy enter ##ed they look ##ed at her curiously , and on ##e of them whispered : " Ar ##e you really going to look upon the fac ##e of Oz the Terrible ? " " Of course , " answered the girl , " if he will see me . " " Oh , he will see you , " said the soldier who had taken her messag ##e to the Wizard , " although he does not lik ##e to hav ##e people ask to see him . Indeed , at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you cam ##e from . Then he ask ##ed me what you look ##ed lik ##e , and when I mention ##ed your silver shoes he was very much interested . At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead , and he decid ##ed he would admit you to his presenc ##e . " Just then a bell rang , and the green girl said to Dorothy , " That is the signal . You must go into the Thron ##e Room alon ##e . " Sh ##e open ##ed a little door and Dorothy walk ##ed boldly through and found herself in a wonderful plac ##e . It was a big , round room with a high arched roof , and the walls and c ##e ##iling and floor wer ##e cover ##ed with larg ##e emeralds set closely together . In the center of the roof was a great light , as bright as the sun , which mad ##e the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner . But what interested Dorothy most was the big thron ##e of green marble that stood in the middle of the room . It was shap ##ed lik ##e a chair and sparkled with gems , as did everything else . In the center of the chair was an enormous Head , without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever . There was no hair upon this head , but it had eyes and a nos ##e and mouth , and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant . As Dorothy gaz ##ed upon this in wonder and fear , the eyes turn ##ed slowly and look ##ed at her sharply and steadily . Then the mouth mov ##ed , and Dorothy heard a voic ##e say : " I am Oz , the Gr ##e ##at and Terrible . Who ar ##e you , and why do you seek me ? " It was not such an awful voic ##e as sh ##e had expected to com ##e from the big Head ; so sh ##e took courag ##e and answered : " I am Dorothy , the Small and Meek . I hav ##e com ##e to you for help . " The eyes look ##ed at her thoughtfully for a full minut ##e . Then said the voic ##e : " Wher ##e did you get the silver shoes ? " " I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East , when my house fell on her and killed her , " sh ##e replied . " Wher ##e did you get the mark upon your forehead ? " continu ##ed the voic ##e . " That is where the Good Witch of the North kiss ##ed me when sh ##e bad ##e me good - by ##e and sent me to you , " said the girl . Again the eyes look ##ed at her sharply , and they saw sh ##e was telling the truth . Then Oz ask ##ed , " What do you wish me to do ? " " Send me back to Kansas , where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry ar ##e , " sh ##e answered earnestly . " I don ' t lik ##e your country , although it is so beautiful . And I am sur ##e Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long . " The eyes wink ##ed three times , and then they turn ##ed up to the c ##e ##iling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seem ##ed to see every part of the room . And at last they look ##ed at Dorothy again . " Why should I do this for you ? " ask ##ed Oz . " Because you ar ##e strong and I am weak ; because you ar ##e a Gr ##e ##at Wizard and I am only a little girl . " " But you wer ##e strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East , " said Oz . " That just happen ##ed , " return ##ed Dorothy simply ; " I could not help it . " " Well , " said the Head , " I will giv ##e you my answer . You hav ##e no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return . In this country everyon ##e must pay for everything he gets . If you wish me to us ##e my magic power to send you hom ##e again you must do something for me first . Help me and I will help you . " " What must I do ? " ask ##ed the girl . " Kill the Wicked Witch of the West , " answered Oz . " But I cannot ! " exclaimed Dorothy , greatly surpris ##ed . " You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes , which bear a powerful charm . There is now but on ##e Wicked Witch left in all this land , and when you can tell me sh ##e is dead I will send you back to Kansas - - but not befor ##e . " The little girl began to weep , sh ##e was so much disappointed ; and the eyes wink ##ed again and look ##ed upon her anxiously , as if the Gr ##e ##at Oz felt that sh ##e could help him if sh ##e would . " I never killed anything , willingly , " sh ##e sobbed . " Even if I want ##ed to , how could I kill the Wicked Witch ? If you , who ar ##e Gr ##e ##at and Terrible , cannot kill her yourself , how do you expect me to do it ? " " I do not know , " said the Head ; " but that is my answer , and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again . Rem ##em ##b ##er that the Witch is Wicked - - tremendously Wicked - and ought to be killed . Now go , and do not ask to see me again until you hav ##e don ##e your task . " Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Thron ##e Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman wer ##e waiting to hear what Oz had said to her . " There is no hop ##e for me , " sh ##e said sadly , " for Oz will not send me hom ##e until I hav ##e killed the Wicked Witch of the West ; and that I can never do . " Her friends wer ##e sorry , but could do nothing to help her ; so Dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep . The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers cam ##e to the Scarecrow and said : " Com ##e with me , for Oz has sent for you . " So the Scarecrow follow ##ed him and was admitted into the great Thron ##e Room , where he saw , sitting in the emerald thron ##e , a most lovely Lady . Sh ##e was dress ##ed in green silk gauz ##e and wor ##e upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels . Growing from her shoulders wer ##e wings , gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reach ##ed them . When the Scarecrow had bow ##ed , as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him , befor ##e this beautiful creatur ##e , sh ##e look ##ed upon him sweetly , and said : " I am Oz , the Gr ##e ##at and Terrible . Who ar ##e you , and why do you seek me ? " Now the Scarecrow , who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him of , was much astonished ; but he answered her bravely . " I am only a Scarecrow , stuff ##ed with straw . Therefor ##e I hav ##e no brains , and I com ##e to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw , so that I may becom ##e as much a man as any other in your dominions . " " Why should I do this for you ? " ask ##ed the Lady . " Because you ar ##e wis ##e and powerful , and no on ##e else can help me , " answered the Scarecrow . " I never grant favors without some return , " said Oz ; " but this much I will promis ##e . If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West , I will bestow upon you a great many brains , and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz . " " I thought you ask ##ed Dorothy to kill the Witch , " said the Scarecrow , in surpris ##e . " So I did . I don ' t care who kills her . But until sh ##e is dead I will not grant your wish . Now go , and do not seek me again until you hav ##e earn ##ed the brains you so greatly desir ##e . " The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had said ; and Dorothy was surpris ##ed to find that the Gr ##e ##at Wizard was not a Head , as sh ##e had seen him , but a lovely Lady . " All the sam ##e , " said the Scarecrow , " sh ##e needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman . " On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers cam ##e to the Tin Woodman and said : " Oz has sent for you . Follow me . " So the Tin Woodman follow ##ed him and cam ##e to the great Thron ##e Room . H ##e did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head , but he hop ##ed it would be the lovely Lady . " For , " he said to himself , " if it is the head , I am sur ##e I shall not be given a heart , sinc ##e a head has no heart of its own and therefor ##e cannot feel for me . But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart , for all ladies ar ##e themselves said to be kindly hearted . But when the Woodman enter ##ed the great Thron ##e Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady , for Oz had taken the shap ##e of a most terrible Beast . It was nearly as big as an elephant , and the green thron ##e seem ##ed hardly strong enough to hold its weight . The Beast had a head lik ##e that of a rhinoceros , only there wer ##e fiv ##e eyes in its fac ##e . There wer ##e fiv ##e long arms growing out of its body , and it also had fiv ##e long , slim legs . Thick , woolly hair cover ##ed every part of it , and a mor ##e dreadful - looking monster could not be imagin ##ed . It was fortunat ##e the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment , for it would hav ##e beat loud and fast from terror . But being only tin , the Woodman was not at all afraid , although he was much disappointed . " I am Oz , the Gr ##e ##at and Terrible , " spok ##e the Beast , in a voic ##e that was on ##e great roar . " Who ar ##e you , and why do you seek me ? " " I am a Woodman , and mad ##e of tin . Therefor ##e I hav ##e no heart , and cannot lov ##e . I pray you to giv ##e me a heart that I may be as other men ar ##e . " " Why should I do this ? " demand ##ed the Beast . " Because I ask it , and you alon ##e can grant my request , " answered the Woodman . Oz gav ##e a low growl at this , but said , gruffly : " If you indeed desir ##e a heart , you must earn it . " " How ? " ask ##ed the Woodman . " Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West , " replied the Beast . " When the Witch is dead , com ##e to me , and I will then giv ##e you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz . " So the Tin Woodman was forc ##ed to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen . They all wondered greatly at the many forms the Gr ##e ##at Wizard could tak ##e upon himself , and the Lion said : " If he is a Beast when I go to see him , I shall roar my loudest , and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask . And if he is the lovely Lady , I shall pretend to spring upon her , and so compel her to do my bidding . And if he is the great Head , he will be at my mercy ; for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to giv ##e us what we desir ##e . So be of good cheer , my friends , for all will yet be well . " The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Thron ##e Room and bad ##e him enter the presenc ##e of Oz . The Lion at onc ##e pass ##ed through the door , and glancing around saw , to his surpris ##e , that befor ##e the thron ##e was a Ball of Fir ##e , so fierc ##e and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaz ##e upon it . His first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fir ##e and was burning up ; but when he tried to go nearer , the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers , and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door . Then a low , quiet voic ##e cam ##e from the Ball of Fir ##e , and thes ##e wer ##e the words it spok ##e : " I am Oz , the Gr ##e ##at and Terrible . Who ar ##e you , and why do you seek me ? " And the Lion answered , " I am a Cowardly Lion , afraid of everything . I cam ##e to you to beg that you giv ##e me courag ##e , so that in reality I may becom ##e the King of Beasts , as men call me . " " Why should I giv ##e you courag ##e ? " demand ##ed Oz . " Because of all Wizards you ar ##e the greatest , and alon ##e hav ##e power to grant my request , " answered the Lion . The Ball of Fir ##e burn ##ed fiercely for a tim ##e , and the voic ##e said , " Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead , and that moment I will giv ##e you courag ##e . But as long as the Witch lives , you must remain a coward . " The Lion was angry at this speech , but could say nothing in reply , and whil ##e he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fir ##e it becam ##e so furiously hot that he turn ##ed tail and rushed from the room . H ##e was glad to find his friends waiting for him , and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard . " What shall we do now ? " ask ##ed Dorothy sadly . " There is only on ##e thing we can do , " return ##ed the Lion , " and that is to go to the land of the Winkies , seek out the Wicked Witch , and destroy her . " " But suppos ##e we cannot ? " said the girl . " Then I shall never hav ##e courag ##e , " declared the Lion . " And I shall never hav ##e brains , " add ##ed the Scarecrow . " And I shall never hav ##e a heart , " spok ##e the Tin of Woodman . " And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry , " said Dorothy , beginning to cry . " Be careful ! " cried the green girl . " The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it . " So Dorothy dried her eyes and said , " I suppos ##e we must try it ; but I am sur ##e I do not want to kill anybody , even to see Aunt Em again . " " I will go with you ; but I ' m too much of a coward to kill the Witch , " said the Lion . " I will go too , " declared the Scarecrow ; " but I shall not be of much help to you , I am such a fool . " " I haven ' t the heart to harm even a Witch , " remarked the Tin Woodman ; " but if you go I certainly shall go with you . " Therefor ##e it was decid ##ed to start upon their journey the next morning , and the Woodman sharpened his ax ##e on a green grindston ##e and had all his joints properly oil ##ed . The Scarecrow stuff ##ed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better . The green girl , who was very kind to them , fill ##ed Dorothy ' s basket with good things to eat , and fasten ##ed a little bell around Toto ' s neck with a green ribbon . They went to bed quit ##e early and slept soundly until daylight , when they wer ##e awaken ##ed by the crowing of a green cock that liv ##ed in the back yard of the Palac ##e , and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg . 12 . The Search for the Wicked Witch The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reach ##ed the room where the Guardian of the Gates liv ##ed . This officer unlock ##ed their spectacles to put them back in his great box , and then he politely open ##ed the gat ##e for our friends . " Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " There is no road , " answered the Guardian of the Gates . " No on ##e ever wishes to go that way . " " How , then , ar ##e we to find her ? " inquired the girl . " That will be easy , " replied the man , " for when sh ##e knows you ar ##e in the country of the Winkies sh ##e will find you , and mak ##e you all her slaves . " " Perhaps not , " said the Scarecrow , " for we mean to destroy her . " " Oh , that is different , " said the Guardian of the Gates . " No on ##e has ever destroy ##ed her befor ##e , so I naturally thought sh ##e would mak ##e slaves of you , as sh ##e has of the rest . But tak ##e care ; for sh ##e is wicked and fierc ##e , and may not allow you to destroy her . Keep to the West , where the sun sets , and you cannot fail to find her . " They thank ##ed him and bad ##e him good - by ##e , and turn ##ed toward the West , walking over fields of soft grass dotted her ##e and there with daisies and buttercups . Dorothy still wor ##e the pretty silk dress sh ##e had put on in the palac ##e , but now , to her surpris ##e , sh ##e found it was no longer green , but pur ##e whit ##e . The ribbon around Toto ' s neck had also lost its green color and was as whit ##e as Dorothy ' s dress . The Emerald City was soon left far behind . As they advanced the ground becam ##e rougher and hillier , for there wer ##e no farms nor houses in this country of the West , and the ground was untilled . In the afternoon the sun shon ##e hot in their faces , for there wer ##e no trees to offer them shad ##e ; so that befor ##e night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion wer ##e tired , and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep , with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch . Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but on ##e ey ##e , yet that was as powerful as a telescop ##e , and could see everywher ##e . So , as sh ##e sat in the door of her castle , sh ##e happen ##ed to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep , with her friends all about her . They wer ##e a long distanc ##e off , but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country ; so sh ##e blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck . At onc ##e there cam ##e running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves . They had long legs and fierc ##e eyes and sharp teeth . " Go to thos ##e people , " said the Witch , " and tear them to pieces . " " Ar ##e you not going to mak ##e them your slaves ? " ask ##ed the leader of the wolves . " No , " sh ##e answered , " on ##e is of tin , and on ##e of straw ; on ##e is a girl and another a Lion . Non ##e of them is fit to work , so you may tear them into small pieces . " " Very well , " said the wolf , and he dashed away at full speed , follow ##ed by the others . It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman wer ##e wid ##e awak ##e and heard the wolves coming . " This is my fight , " said the Woodman , " so get behind me and I will meet them as they com ##e . " H ##e seiz ##ed his ax ##e , which he had mad ##e very sharp , and as the leader of the wolves cam ##e on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf ' s head from its body , so that it immediately di ##ed . As soon as he could rais ##e his ax ##e another wolf cam ##e up , and he also fell under the sharp edg ##e of the Tin Woodman ' s weapon . There wer ##e forty wolves , and forty times a wolf was killed , so that at last they all lay dead in a heap befor ##e the Woodman . Then he put down his ax ##e and sat besid ##e the Scarecrow , who said , " It was a good fight , friend . " They wait ##ed until Dorothy awok ##e the next morning . The little girl was quit ##e frighten ##ed when sh ##e saw the great pil ##e of shaggy wolves , but the Tin Woodman told her all . Sh ##e thank ##ed him for saving them and sat down to breakfast , after which they started again upon their journey . Now this sam ##e morning the Wicked Witch cam ##e to the door of her castle and look ##ed out with her on ##e ey ##e that could see far off . Sh ##e saw all her wolves lying dead , and the strangers still traveling through her country . This mad ##e her angrier than befor ##e , and sh ##e blew her silver whistle twic ##e . Straightway a great flock of wild crows cam ##e flying toward her , enough to darken the sky . And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow , " Fly at onc ##e to the strangers ; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces . " The wild crows flew in on ##e great flock toward Dorothy and her companions . When the little girl saw them coming sh ##e was afraid . But the Scarecrow said , " This is my battle , so li ##e down besid ##e me and you will not be harm ##ed . " So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow , and he stood up and stretch ##ed out his arms . And when the crows saw him they wer ##e frighten ##ed , as thes ##e birds always ar ##e by scarecrows , and did not dar ##e to com ##e any nearer . But the King Crow said : " It is only a stuff ##ed man . I will peck his eyes out . " The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow , who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it di ##ed . And then another crow flew at him , and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also . There wer ##e forty crows , and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck , until at last all wer ##e lying dead besid ##e him . Then he call ##ed to his companions to ris ##e , and again they went upon their journey . When the Wicked Witch look ##ed out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap , sh ##e got into a terrible rag ##e , and blew three times upon her silver whistle . Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air , and a swarm of black bees cam ##e flying toward her . " Go to the strangers and sting them to death ! " command ##ed the Witch , and the bees turn ##ed and flew rapidly until they cam ##e to where Dorothy and her friends wer ##e walking . But the Woodman had seen them coming , and the Scarecrow had decid ##ed what to do . " Tak ##e out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the Lion , " he said to the Woodman , " and the bees cannot sting them . " This the Woodman did , and as Dorothy lay clos ##e besid ##e the Lion and held Toto in her arms , the straw cover ##ed them entirely . The bees cam ##e and found no on ##e but the Woodman to sting , so they flew at him and brok ##e off all their stings against the tin , without hurting the Woodman at all . And as bees cannot liv ##e when their stings ar ##e broken that was the end of the black bees , and they lay scatter ##ed thick about the Woodman , lik ##e little heaps of fin ##e coal . Then Dorothy and the Lion got up , and the girl help ##ed the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again , until he was as good as ever . So they started upon their journey onc ##e mor ##e . The Wicked Witch was so angry when sh ##e saw her black bees in little heaps lik ##e fin ##e coal that sh ##e stamped her foot and tor ##e her hair and gnashed her teeth . And then sh ##e call ##ed a dozen of her slaves , who wer ##e the Winkies , and gav ##e them sharp spears , telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them . The Winkies wer ##e not a brav ##e people , but they had to do as they wer ##e told . So they marched away until they cam ##e near to Dorothy . Then the Lion gav ##e a great roar and sprang towards them , and the poor Winkies wer ##e so frighten ##ed that they ran back as fast as they could . When they return ##ed to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap , and sent them back to their work , after which sh ##e sat down to think what sh ##e should do next . Sh ##e could not understand how all her plans to destroy thes ##e strangers had fail ##ed ; but sh ##e was a powerful Witch , as well as a wicked on ##e , and sh ##e soon mad ##e up her mind how to act . There was , in her cupboard , a Golden Cap , with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it . This Golden Cap had a charm . Whoever own ##ed it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys , who would obey any order they wer ##e given . But no person could command thes ##e strang ##e creatures mor ##e than three times . Twic ##e already the Wicked Witch had us ##ed the charm of the Cap . Onc ##e was when sh ##e had mad ##e the Winkies her slaves , and set herself to rule over their country . The Winged Monkeys had help ##ed her do this . The second tim ##e was when sh ##e had fought against the Gr ##e ##at Oz himself , and driven him out of the land of the West . The Winged Monkeys had also help ##ed her in doing this . Only onc ##e mor ##e could sh ##e us ##e this Golden Cap , for which reason sh ##e did not lik ##e to do so until all her other powers wer ##e exhausted . But now that her fierc ##e wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees wer ##e gon ##e , and her slaves had been scar ##ed away by the Cowardly Lion , sh ##e saw there was only on ##e way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends . So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and plac ##ed it upon her head . Then sh ##e stood upon her left foot and said slowly : " Ep - pe , pep - pe , kak - k ##e ! " Next sh ##e stood upon her right foot and said : " Hil - lo , hol - lo , hel - lo ! " After this sh ##e stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voic ##e : " Ziz - zy , zuz - zy , zik ! " Now the charm began to work . The sky was darken ##ed , and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air . There was a rushing of many wings , a great chattering and laughing , and the sun cam ##e out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys , each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders . On ##e , much bigger than the others , seem ##ed to be their leader . H ##e flew clos ##e to the Witch and said , " You hav ##e call ##ed us for the third and last tim ##e . What do you command ? " " Go to the strangers who ar ##e within my land and destroy them all except the Lion , " said the Wicked Witch . " Bring that beast to me , for I hav ##e a mind to harness him lik ##e a horse , and mak ##e him work . " " Your commands shall be obey ##ed , " said the leader . Then , with a great deal of chattering and nois ##e , the Winged Monkeys flew away to the plac ##e where Dorothy and her friends wer ##e walking . Some of the Monkeys seiz ##ed the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they wer ##e over a country thickly cover ##ed with sharp rocks . Her ##e they dropped the poor Woodman , who fell a great distanc ##e to the rocks , where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither mov ##e nor groan . Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow , and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head . They mad ##e his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tre ##e . The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rop ##e around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs , until he was unable to bit ##e or scratch or struggle in any way . Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witch ' s castle , where he was plac ##ed in a small yard with a high iron fenc ##e around it , so that he could not escap ##e . But Dorothy they did not harm at all . Sh ##e stood , with Toto in her arms , watching the sad fat ##e of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn . The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her , his long , hairy arms stretch ##ed out and his ugly fac ##e grinning terribly ; but he saw the mark of the Good Witch ' s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short , motioning the others not to touch her . " W ##e dar ##e not harm this little girl , " he said to them , " for sh ##e is protected by the Power of Good , and that is greater than the Power of Evil . All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leav ##e her there . " So , carefully and gently , they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they cam ##e to the castle , where they set her down upon the front doorstep . Then the leader said to the Witch : " W ##e hav ##e obey ##ed you as far as we wer ##e able . The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow ar ##e destroy ##ed , and the Lion is tied up in your yard . The little girl we dar ##e not harm , nor the dog sh ##e carries in her arms . Your power over our band is now end ##ed , and you will never see us again . " Then all the Winged Monkeys , with much laughing and chattering and nois ##e , flew into the air and wer ##e soon out of sight . The Wicked Witch was both surpris ##ed and worried when sh ##e saw the mark on Dorothy ' s forehead , for sh ##e knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor sh ##e , herself , dar ##e hurt the girl in any way . Sh ##e look ##ed down at Dorothy ' s feet , and seeing the Silver Shoes , began to tremble with fear , for sh ##e knew what a powerful charm belong ##ed to them . At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy ; but sh ##e happen ##ed to look into the child ' s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was , and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gav ##e her . So the Wicked Witch laugh ##ed to herself , and thought , " I can still mak ##e her my slav ##e , for sh ##e does not know how to us ##e her power . " Then sh ##e said to Dorothy , harshly and severely : " Com ##e with me ; and see that you mind everything I tell you , for if you do not I will mak ##e an end of you , as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow . " Dorothy follow ##ed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they cam ##e to the kitchen , where the Witch bad ##e her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fir ##e fed with wood . Dorothy went to work me ##e ##kly , with her mind mad ##e up to work as hard as sh ##e could ; for sh ##e was glad the Wicked Witch had decid ##ed not to kill her . With Dorothy hard at work , the Witch thought sh ##e would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion lik ##e a horse ; it would amus ##e her , sh ##e was sur ##e , to mak ##e him draw her chariot whenever sh ##e wish ##ed to go to driv ##e . But as sh ##e open ##ed the gat ##e the Lion gav ##e a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid , and ran out and shut the gat ##e again . " If I cannot harness you , " said the Witch to the Lion , speaking through the bars of the gat ##e , " I can starv ##e you . You shall hav ##e nothing to eat until you do as I wish . " So after that sh ##e took no food to the imprisoned Lion ; but every day sh ##e cam ##e to the gat ##e at noon and ask ##ed , " Ar ##e you ready to be harness ##ed lik ##e a horse ? " And the Lion would answer , " No . If you com ##e in this yard , I will bit ##e you . " The reason the Lion did not hav ##e to do as the Witch wish ##ed was that every night , whil ##e the woman was asleep , Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard . After he had eaten he would li ##e down on his bed of straw , and Dorothy would li ##e besid ##e him and put her head on his soft , shaggy man ##e , whil ##e they talk ##ed of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escap ##e . But they could find no way to get out of the castle , for it was constantly guard ##ed by the yellow Winkies , who wer ##e the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as sh ##e told them . The girl had to work hard during the day , and often the Witch thr ##e ##atened to beat her with the sam ##e old umbrella sh ##e always carried in her hand . But , in truth , sh ##e did not dar ##e to strik ##e Dorothy , because of the mark upon her forehead . The child did not know this , and was full of fear for herself and Toto . Onc ##e the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brav ##e little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return . The Witch did not bleed where sh ##e was bitten , for sh ##e was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years befor ##e . Dorothy ' s lif ##e becam ##e very sad as sh ##e grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again . Sometimes sh ##e would cry bitterly for hours , with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her fac ##e , whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress . Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him ; but he knew the little girl was unhappy , and that mad ##e him unhappy too . Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to hav ##e for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wor ##e . Her bees and her crows and her wolves wer ##e lying in heaps and drying up , and sh ##e had us ##ed up all the power of the Golden Cap ; but if sh ##e could only get hold of the Silver Shoes , they would giv ##e her mor ##e power than all the other things sh ##e had lost . Sh ##e watch ##ed Dorothy carefully , to see if sh ##e ever took off her shoes , thinking sh ##e might steal them . But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that sh ##e never took them off except at night and when sh ##e took her bath . The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dar ##e go in Dorothy ' s room at night to tak ##e the shoes , and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark , so sh ##e never cam ##e near when Dorothy was bathing . Indeed , the old Witch never touch ##ed water , nor ever let water touch her in any way . But the wicked creatur ##e was very cunning , and sh ##e finally thought of a trick that would giv ##e her what sh ##e want ##ed . Sh ##e plac ##ed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor , and then by her magic arts mad ##e the iron invisible to human eyes . So that when Dorothy walk ##ed across the floor sh ##e stumbled over the bar , not being able to see it , and fell at full length . Sh ##e was not much hurt , but in her fall on ##e of the Silver Shoes cam ##e off ; and befor ##e sh ##e could reach it , the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot . The wicked woman was greatly pleas ##ed with the success of her trick , for as long as sh ##e had on ##e of the shoes sh ##e own ##ed half the power of their charm , and Dorothy could not us ##e it against her , even had sh ##e known how to do so . The little girl , seeing sh ##e had lost on ##e of her pretty shoes , grew angry , and said to the Witch , " Giv ##e me back my sho ##e ! " " I will not , " retorted the Witch , " for it is now my sho ##e , and not yours . " " You ar ##e a wicked creatur ##e ! " cried Dorothy . " You hav ##e no right to tak ##e my sho ##e from me . " " I shall keep it , just the sam ##e , " said the Witch , laughing at her , " and someday I shall get the other on ##e from you , too . " This mad ##e Dorothy so very angry that sh ##e pick ##ed up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch , wetting her from head to foot . Instantly the wicked woman gav ##e a loud cry of fear , and then , as Dorothy look ##ed at her in wonder , the Witch began to shrink and fall away . " See what you hav ##e don ##e ! " sh ##e scream ##ed . " In a minut ##e I shall melt away . " " I ' m very sorry , indeed , " said Dorothy , who was truly frighten ##ed to see the Witch actually melting away lik ##e brown sugar befor ##e her very eyes . " Didn ' t you know water would be the end of me ? " ask ##ed the Witch , in a wailing , despairing voic ##e . " Of course not , " answered Dorothy . " How should I ? " " Well , in a few minutes I shall be all melted , and you will hav ##e the castle to yourself . I hav ##e been wicked in my day , but I never thought a little girl lik ##e you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds . Look out - - her ##e I go ! " With thes ##e words the Witch fell down in a brown , melted , shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor . Seeing that sh ##e had really melted away to nothing , Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess . Sh ##e then swept it all out the door . After picking out the silver sho ##e , which was all that was left of the old woman , sh ##e clean ##ed and dried it with a cloth , and put it on her foot again . Then , being at last free to do as sh ##e chos ##e , sh ##e ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had com ##e to an end , and that they wer ##e no longer prisoners in a strang ##e land . 13 . The Rescu ##e The Cowardly Lion was much pleas ##ed to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water , and Dorothy at onc ##e unlock ##ed the gat ##e of his prison and set him free . They went in together to the castle , where Dorothy ' s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they wer ##e no longer slaves . There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies , for they had been mad ##e to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch , who had always treat ##ed them with great cruelty . They kept this day as a holiday , then and ever after , and spent the tim ##e in feasting and dancing . " If our friends , the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman , wer ##e only with us , " said the Lion , " I should be quit ##e happy . " " Don ' t you suppos ##e we could rescu ##e them ? " ask ##ed the girl anxiously . " W ##e can try , " answered the Lion . So they call ##ed the yellow Winkies and ask ##ed them if they would help to rescu ##e their friends , and the Winkies said that they would be delight ##ed to do all in their power for Dorothy , who had set them free from bondag ##e . So sh ##e chos ##e a number of the Winkies who look ##ed as if they knew the most , and they all started away . They travel ##ed that day and part of the next until they cam ##e to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay , all battered and bent . His ax ##e was near him , but the blad ##e was rusted and the handle broken off short . The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms , and carried him back to the Yellow Castle again , Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend , and the Lion looking sober and sorry . When they reach ##ed the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies : " Ar ##e any of your people tinsmiths ? " " Oh , yes . Some of us ar ##e very good tinsmiths , " they told her . " Then bring them to me , " sh ##e said . And when the tinsmiths cam ##e , bringing with them all their tools in baskets , sh ##e inquired , " Can you straighten out thos ##e dents in the Tin Woodman , and bend him back into shap ##e again , and solder him together where he is broken ? " The tinsmiths look ##ed the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever . So they set to work in on ##e of the big yellow rooms of the castle and work ##ed for three days and four nights , hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman , until at last he was straighten ##ed out into his old form , and his joints work ##ed as well as ever . To be sur ##e , there wer ##e several patches on him , but the tinsmiths did a good job , and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all . When , at last , he walk ##ed into Dorothy ' s room and thank ##ed her for rescuing him , he was so pleas ##ed that he wept tears of joy , and Dorothy had to wip ##e every tear carefully from his fac ##e with her apron , so his joints would not be rusted . At the sam ##e tim ##e her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again , and thes ##e tears did not need to be wip ##ed away . As for the Lion , he wip ##ed his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it becam ##e quit ##e wet , and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried . " If we only had the Scarecrow with us again , " said the Tin Woodman , when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happen ##ed , " I should be quit ##e happy . " " W ##e must try to find him , " said the girl . So sh ##e call ##ed the Winkies to help her , and they walk ##ed all that day and part of the next until they cam ##e to the tall tre ##e in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the carecrow ' s clothes . It was a very tall tre ##e , and the trunk was so smooth that no on ##e could climb it ; but the Woodman said at onc ##e , " I ' ll chop it down , and then we can get the Scarecrow ' s clothes . " Now whil ##e the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself , another of the Winkies , who was a goldsmith , had mad ##e an ax ##e - handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman ' s ax ##e , instead of the old broken handle . Others polished the blad ##e until all the rust was removed and it glistened lik ##e burnished silver . As soon as he had spoken , the Tin Woodman began to chop , and in a short tim ##e the tre ##e fell over with a crash , whereupon the Scarecrow ' s clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground . Dorothy pick ##ed them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle , where they wer ##e stuff ##ed with nic ##e , clean straw ; and behold ! her ##e was the Scarecrow , as good as ever , thanking them over and over again for saving him . Now that they wer ##e reunited , Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle , where they found everything they need ##ed to mak ##e them comfortable . But on ##e day the girl thought of Aunt Em , and said , " W ##e must go back to Oz , and claim his promis ##e . " " Yes , " said the Woodman , " at last I shall get my heart . " " And I shall get my brains , " add ##ed the Scarecrow joyfully . " And I shall get my courag ##e , " said the Lion thoughtfully . " And I shall get back to Kansas , " cried Dorothy , clapping her hands . " Oh , let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow ! " This they decid ##ed to do . The next day they call ##ed the Winkies together and bad ##e them good - by ##e . The Winkies wer ##e sorry to hav ##e them go , and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West . Finding they wer ##e determined to go , the Winkies gav ##e Toto and the Lion each a golden collar ; and to Dorothy they present ##ed a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds ; and to the Scarecrow they gav ##e a gold - head ##ed walking stick , to keep him from stumbling ; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oil - can , inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels . Every on ##e of the travelers mad ##e the Winkies a pretty speech in return , and all shook hands with them until their arms ached . Dorothy went to the Witch ' s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey , and there sh ##e saw the Golden Cap . Sh ##e tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly . Sh ##e did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap , but sh ##e saw that it was pretty , so sh ##e mad ##e up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket . Then , being prepared for the journey , they all started for the Emerald City ; and the Winkies gav ##e them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them . 14 . The Winged Monkeys You will remember there was no road - - not even a pathway - - between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City . When the four travelers went in search of the Witch sh ##e had seen them coming , and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her . It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried . They knew , of course , they must go straight east , toward the rising sun ; and they started off in the right way . But at noon , when the sun was over their heads , they did not know which was east and which was west , and that was the reason they wer ##e lost in the great fields . They kept on walking , however , and at night the moon cam ##e out and shon ##e brightly . So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning - - all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman . The next morning the sun was behind a cloud , but they started on , as if they wer ##e quit ##e sur ##e which way they wer ##e going . " If we walk far enough , " said Dorothy , " I am sur ##e we shall sometim ##e com ##e to some plac ##e . " But day by day pass ##ed away , and they still saw nothing befor ##e them but the scarlet fields . The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit . " W ##e hav ##e surely lost our way , " he said , " and unless we find it again in tim ##e to reach the Emerald City , I shall never get my brains . " " Nor I my heart , " declared the Tin Woodman . " It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz , and you must admit this is a very long journey . " " You see , " said the Cowardly Lion , with a whimper , " I haven ' t the courag ##e to keep tramping forever , without getting anywher ##e at all . " Then Dorothy lost heart . Sh ##e sat down on the grass and look ##ed at her companions , and they sat down and look ##ed at her , and Toto found that for the first tim ##e in his lif ##e he was too tired to chas ##e a butterfly that flew past his head . So he put out his tongu ##e and panted and look ##ed at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next . " Suppos ##e we call the field mic ##e , " sh ##e suggested . " They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City . " " To be sur ##e they could , " cried the Scarecrow . " Why didn ' t we think of that befor ##e ? " Dorothy blew the little whistle sh ##e had always carried about her neck sinc ##e the Queen of the Mic ##e had given it to her . In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet , and many of the small gray mic ##e cam ##e running up to her . Among them was the Queen herself , who ask ##ed , in her squ ##e ##aky little voic ##e : " What can I do for my friends ? " " W ##e hav ##e lost our way , " said Dorothy . " Can you tell us where the Emerald City is ? " " Certainly , " answered the Queen ; " but it is a great way off , for you hav ##e had it at your backs all this tim ##e . " Then sh ##e notic ##ed Dorothy ' s Golden Cap , and said , " Why don ' t you us ##e the charm of the Cap , and call the Winged Monkeys to you ? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour . " " I didn ' t know there was a charm , " answered Dorothy , in surpris ##e . " What is it ? " " It is written insid ##e the Golden Cap , " replied the Queen of the Mic ##e . " But if you ar ##e going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away , for they ar ##e full of mischief and think it great fun to plagu ##e us . " " Won ' t they hurt me ? " ask ##ed the girl anxiously . " Oh , no . They must obey the wearer of the Cap . Good - by ##e ! " And sh ##e scampered out of sight , with all the mic ##e hurrying after her . Dorothy look ##ed insid ##e the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining . Thes ##e , sh ##e thought , must be the charm , so sh ##e read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head . " Ep - pe , pep - pe , kak - k ##e ! " sh ##e said , standing on her left foot . " What did you say ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow , who did not know what sh ##e was doing . " Hil - lo , hol - lo , hel - lo ! " Dorothy went on , standing this tim ##e on her right foot . " Hello ! " replied the Tin Woodman calmly . " Ziz - zy , zuz - zy , zik ! " said Dorothy , who was now standing on both feet . This end ##ed the saying of the charm , and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings , as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them . The King bow ##ed low befor ##e Dorothy , and ask ##ed , " What is your command ? " " W ##e wish to go to the Emerald City , " said the child , " and we hav ##e lost our way . " " W ##e will carry you , " replied the King , and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her . Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion , and on ##e little Monkey seiz ##ed Toto and flew after them , although the dog tried hard to bit ##e him . The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman wer ##e rather frighten ##ed at first , for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treat ##ed them befor ##e ; but they saw that no harm was intended , so they rod ##e through the air quit ##e cheerfully , and had a fin ##e tim ##e looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them . Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys , on ##e of them the King himself . They had mad ##e a chair of their hands and wer ##e careful not to hurt her . " Why do you hav ##e to obey the charm of the Golden Cap ? " sh ##e ask ##ed . " That is a long story , " answered the King , with a Winged laugh ; " but as we hav ##e a long journey befor ##e us , I will pass the tim ##e by telling you about it , if you wish . " " I shall be glad to hear it , " sh ##e replied . " Onc ##e , " began the leader , " we wer ##e a free people , living happily in the great forest , flying from tre ##e to tre ##e , eating nuts and fruit , and doing just as we pleas ##ed without calling anybody master . Perhaps some of us wer ##e rather too full of mischief at times , flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings , chasing birds , and throwing nuts at the people who walk ##ed in the forest . But we wer ##e careless and happy and full of fun , and enjoyed every minut ##e of the day . This was many years ago , long befor ##e Oz cam ##e out of the clouds to rule over this land . " There liv ##ed her ##e then , away at the North , a beautiful princess , who was also a powerful sorceress . All her magic was us ##ed to help the people , and sh ##e was never known to hurt anyon ##e who was good . Her nam ##e was Gayelett ##e , and sh ##e liv ##ed in a handsom ##e palac ##e built from great blocks of ruby . Everyon ##e lov ##ed her , but her greatest sorrow was that sh ##e could find no on ##e to lov ##e in return , sinc ##e all the men wer ##e much too stupid and ugly to mat ##e with on ##e so beautiful and wis ##e . At last , however , sh ##e found a boy who was handsom ##e and manly and wis ##e beyond his years . Gayelett ##e mad ##e up her mind that when he grew to be a man sh ##e would mak ##e him her husband , so sh ##e took him to her ruby palac ##e and us ##ed all her magic powers to mak ##e him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish . When he grew to manhood , Quelala , as he was call ##ed , was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land , whil ##e his manly beauty was so great that Gayelett ##e lov ##ed him dearly , and hastened to mak ##e everything ready for the wedding . " My grandfather was at that tim ##e the King of the Winged Monkeys which liv ##ed in the forest near Gayelett ##e ' s palac ##e , and the old fellow lov ##ed a jok ##e better than a good dinner . On ##e day , just befor ##e the wedding , my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking besid ##e the river . H ##e was dress ##ed in a rich costum ##e of pink silk and purple velvet , and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do . At his word the band flew down and seiz ##ed Quelala , carried him in their arms until they wer ##e over the middle of the river , and then dropped him into the water . " ` Swim out , my fin ##e fellow , ' cried my grandfather , ` and see if the water has spotted your clothes . ' Quelala was much too wis ##e not to swim , and he was not in the least spoil ##ed by all his good fortun ##e . H ##e laugh ##ed , when he cam ##e to the top of the water , and swam in to shor ##e . But when Gayelett ##e cam ##e running out to him sh ##e found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river . " The princess was angry , and sh ##e knew , of course , who did it . Sh ##e had all the Winged Monkeys brought befor ##e her , and sh ##e said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treat ##ed as they had treat ##ed Quelala , and dropped in the river . But my grandfather pleaded hard , for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied , and Quelala said a kind word for them also ; so that Gayelett ##e finally spared them , on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap . This Cap had been mad ##e for a wedding present to Quelala , and it is said to hav ##e cost the princess half her kingdom . Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at onc ##e agreed to the condition , and that is how it happens that we ar ##e three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap , whosoever he may be . " " And what becam ##e of them ? " ask ##ed Dorothy , who had been greatly interested in the story . " Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap , " replied the Monkey , " he was the first to lay his wishes upon us . As his brid ##e could not bear the sight of us , he call ##ed us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where sh ##e could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey , which we wer ##e glad to do , for we wer ##e all afraid of her . " This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West , who mad ##e us enslav ##e the Winkies , and afterward driv ##e Oz himself out of the Land of the West . Now the Golden Cap is yours , and three times you hav ##e the right to lay your wishes upon us . " As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy look ##ed down and saw the green , shining walls of the Emerald City befor ##e them . Sh ##e wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys , but was glad the journey was over . The strang ##e creatures set the travelers down carefully befor ##e the gat ##e of the City , the King bow ##ed low to Dorothy , and then flew swiftly away , follow ##ed by all his band . " That was a good rid ##e , " said the little girl . " Yes , and a quick way out of our troubles , " replied the Lion . " How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap ! " 15 . The Discovery of Oz , the Terrible The four travelers walk ##ed up to the great gat ##e of Emerald City and rang the bell . After ringing several times , it was open ##ed by the sam ##e Guardian of the Gates they had met befor ##e . " What ! ar ##e you back again ? " he ask ##ed , in surpris ##e . " Do you not see us ? " answered the Scarecrow . " But I thought you had gon ##e to visit the Wicked Witch of the West . " " W ##e did visit her , " said the Scarecrow . " And sh ##e let you go again ? " ask ##ed the man , in wonder . " Sh ##e could not help it , for sh ##e is melted , " explained the Scarecrow . " Melted ! Well , that is good news , indeed , " said the man . " Who melted her ? " " It was Dorothy , " said the Lion gravely . " Good gracious ! " exclaimed the man , and he bow ##ed very low indeed befor ##e her . Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes , just as he had don ##e befor ##e . Afterward they pass ##ed on through the gat ##e into the Emerald City . When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West , they all gathered around the travelers and follow ##ed them in a great crowd to the Palac ##e of Oz . The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard befor ##e the door , but he let them in at onc ##e , and they wer ##e again met by the beautiful green girl , who show ##ed each of them to their old rooms at onc ##e , so they might rest until the Gr ##e ##at Oz was ready to receiv ##e them . The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had com ##e back again , after destroying the Wicked Witch ; but Oz mad ##e no reply . They thought the Gr ##e ##at Wizard would send for them at onc ##e , but he did not . They had no word from him the next day , nor the next , nor the next . The waiting was tiresom ##e and wearing , and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion , after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery . So the Scarecrow at last ask ##ed the green girl to tak ##e another messag ##e to Oz , saying if he did not let them in to see him at onc ##e they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them , and find out whether he kept his promises or not . When the Wizard was given this messag ##e he was so frighten ##ed that he sent word for them to com ##e to the Thron ##e Room at four minutes after nin ##e o ' clock the next morning . H ##e had onc ##e met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West , and he did not wish to meet them again . The four travelers pass ##ed a sleepless night , each thinking of the gift Oz had promis ##ed to bestow on him . Dorothy fell asleep only onc ##e , and then sh ##e dream ##ed sh ##e was in Kansas , where Aunt Em was telling her how glad sh ##e was to hav ##e her little girl at hom ##e again . Promptly at nin ##e o ' clock the next morning the green - whiskered soldier cam ##e to them , and four minutes later they all went into the Thron ##e Room of the Gr ##e ##at Oz . Of course each on ##e of them expected to see the Wizard in the shap ##e he had taken befor ##e , and all wer ##e greatly surpris ##ed when they look ##ed about and saw no on ##e at all in the room . They kept clos ##e to the door and closer to on ##e another , for the stillness of the empty room was mor ##e dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz tak ##e . Presently they heard a solemn Voic ##e , that seem ##ed to com ##e from somewher ##e near the top of the great dom ##e , and it said : " I am Oz , the Gr ##e ##at and Terrible . Why do you seek me ? " They look ##ed again in every part of the room , and then , seeing no on ##e , Dorothy ask ##ed , " Wher ##e ar ##e you ? " " I am everywher ##e , " answered the Voic ##e , " but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible . I will now seat myself upon my thron ##e , that you may converse with me . " Indeed , the Voic ##e seem ##ed just then to com ##e straight from the thron ##e itself ; so they walk ##ed toward it and stood in a row whil ##e Dorothy said : " W ##e hav ##e com ##e to claim our promis ##e , O Oz . " " What promis ##e ? " ask ##ed Oz . " You promis ##ed to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroy ##ed , " said the girl . " And you promis ##ed to giv ##e me brains , " said the Scarecrow . " And you promis ##ed to giv ##e me a heart , " said the Tin Woodman . " And you promis ##ed to giv ##e me courag ##e , " said the Cowardly Lion . " Is the Wicked Witch really destroy ##ed ? " ask ##ed the Voic ##e , and Dorothy thought it trembled a little . " Yes , " sh ##e answered , " I melted her with a bucket of water . " " Dear me , " said the Voic ##e , " how sudden ! Well , com ##e to me tomorrow , for I must hav ##e tim ##e to think it over . " " You ' ve had plenty of tim ##e already , " said the Tin Woodman angrily . " W ##e shan ' t wait a day longer , " said the Scarecrow . " You must keep your promises to us ! " exclaimed Dorothy . The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard , so he gav ##e a larg ##e , loud roar , which was so fierc ##e and dreadful that Toto jump ##ed away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner . As it fell with a crash they look ##ed that way , and the next moment all of them wer ##e fill ##ed with wonder . For they saw , standing in just the spot the screen had hidden , a little old man , with a bald head and a wrinkled fac ##e , who seem ##ed to be as much surpris ##ed as they wer ##e . The Tin Woodman , raising his ax ##e , rushed toward the little man and cried out , " Who ar ##e you ? " " I am Oz , the Gr ##e ##at and Terrible , " said the little man , in a trembling voic ##e . " But don ' t strik ##e me - - pleas ##e don ' t - - and I ' ll do anything you want me to . " Our friends look ##ed at him in surpris ##e and dismay . " I thought Oz was a great Head , " said Dorothy . " And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady , " said the Scarecrow . " And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast , " said the Tin Woodman . " And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fir ##e , " exclaimed the Lion . " No , you ar ##e all wrong , " said the little man me ##e ##kly . " I hav ##e been making believ ##e . " " Making believ ##e ! " cried Dorothy . " Ar ##e you not a Gr ##e ##at Wizard ? " " Hush , my dear , " he said . " Don ' t speak so loud , or you will be overh ##ear ##d - - and I should be ruined . I ' m suppos ##ed to be a Gr ##e ##at Wizard . " " And aren ' t you ? " sh ##e ask ##ed . " Not a bit of it , my dear ; I ' m just a common man . " " You ' re mor ##e than that , " said the Scarecrow , in a griev ##ed ton ##e ; " you ' re a humbug . " " Exactly so ! " declared the little man , rubbing his hands together as if it pleas ##ed him . " I am a humbug . " " But this is terrible , " said the Tin Woodman . " How shall I ever get my heart ? " " Or I my courag ##e ? " ask ##ed the Lion . " Or I my brains ? " wail ##ed the Scarecrow , wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleev ##e . " My dear friends , " said Oz , " I pray you not to speak of thes ##e little things . Think of me , and the terrible trouble I ' m in at being found out . " " Doesn ' t anyon ##e else know you ' re a humbug ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " No on ##e knows it but you four - - and myself , " replied Oz . " I hav ##e fool ##ed everyon ##e so long that I thought I should never be found out . It was a great mistak ##e my ever letting you into the Thron ##e Room . Usually I will not see even my subjects , and so they believ ##e I am something terrible . " " But , I don ' t understand , " said Dorothy , in bewilderment . " How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head ? " " That was on ##e of my tricks , " answered Oz . " Step this way , pleas ##e , and I will tell you all about it . " H ##e led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Thron ##e Room , and they all follow ##ed him . H ##e pointed to on ##e corner , in which lay the great Head , mad ##e out of many thicknesses of paper , and with a carefully painted fac ##e . " This I hung from the c ##e ##iling by a wir ##e , " said Oz . " I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread , to mak ##e the eyes mov ##e and the mouth open . " " But how about the voic ##e ? " sh ##e inquired . " Oh , I am a ventriloquist , " said the little man . " I can throw the sound of my voic ##e wherever I wish , so that you thought it was coming out of the Head . Her ##e ar ##e the other things I us ##ed to deceiv ##e you . " H ##e show ##ed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seem ##ed to be the lovely Lady . And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins , sewn together , with slats to keep their sides out . As for the Ball of Fir ##e , the false Wizard had hung that also from the c ##e ##iling . It was really a ball of cotton , but when oil was poured upon it the ball burn ##ed fiercely . " R ##e ##ally , " said the Scarecrow , " you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug . " " I am - - I certainly am , " answered the little man sorrowfully ; " but it was the only thing I could do . Sit down , pleas ##e , there ar ##e plenty of chairs ; and I will tell you my story . " So they sat down and listened whil ##e he told the following tal ##e . " I was born in Omaha - - " " Why , that isn ' t very far from Kansas ! " cried Dorothy . " No , but it ' s farther from her ##e , " he said , shaking his head at her sadly . " When I grew up I becam ##e a ventriloquist , and at that I was very well trained by a great master . I can imitat ##e any kind of a bird or beast . " Her ##e he mew ##ed so lik ##e a kitten that Toto prick ##ed up his ears and look ##ed everywher ##e to see where sh ##e was . " After a tim ##e , " continu ##ed Oz , " I tired of that , and becam ##e a balloonist . " " What is that ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day , so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus , " he explained . " Oh , " sh ##e said , " I know . " " Well , on ##e day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted , so that I couldn ' t com ##e down again . It went way up abov ##e the clouds , so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many , many miles away . For a day and a night I travel ##ed through the air , and on the morning of the second day I awok ##e and found the balloon floating over a strang ##e and beautiful country . " It cam ##e down gradually , and I was not hurt a bit . But I found myself in the midst of a strang ##e people , who , seeing me com ##e from the clouds , thought I was a great Wizard . Of course I let them think so , because they wer ##e afraid of me , and promis ##ed to do anything I wish ##ed them to . " Just to amus ##e myself , and keep the good people busy , I ordered them to build this City , and my Palac ##e ; and they did it all willingly and well . Then I thought , as the country was so green and beautiful , I would call it the Emerald City ; and to mak ##e the nam ##e fit better I put green spectacles on all the people , so that everything they saw was green . " " But isn ' t everything her ##e green ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " No mor ##e than in any other city , " replied Oz ; " but when you wear green spectacles , why of course everything you see looks green to you . The Emerald City was built a great many years ago , for I was a young man when the balloon brought me her ##e , and I am a very old man now . But my people hav ##e worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City , and it certainly is a beautiful plac ##e , abounding in jewels and precious metals , and every good thing that is need ##ed to mak ##e on ##e happy . I hav ##e been good to the people , and they lik ##e me ; but ever sinc ##e this Palac ##e was built , I hav ##e shut myself up and would not see any of them . " On ##e of my greatest fears was the Witches , for whil ##e I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches wer ##e really able to do wonderful things . There wer ##e four of them in this country , and they ruled the people who liv ##e in the North and South and East and West . Fortunately , the Witches of the North and South wer ##e good , and I knew they would do me no harm ; but the Witches of the East and West wer ##e terribly wicked , and had they not thought I was mor ##e powerful than they themselves , they would surely hav ##e destroy ##ed me . As it was , I liv ##ed in deadly fear of them for many years ; so you can imagin ##e how pleas ##ed I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East . When you cam ##e to me , I was willing to promis ##e anything if you would only do away with the other Witch ; but , now that you hav ##e melted her , I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises . " " I think you ar ##e a very bad man , " said Dorothy . " Oh , no , my dear ; I ' m really a very good man , but I ' m a very bad Wizard , I must admit . " " Can ' t you giv ##e me brains ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . " You don ' t need them . You ar ##e learning something every day . A baby has brains , but it doesn ' t know much . Experienc ##e is the only thing that brings knowledg ##e , and the longer you ar ##e on earth the mor ##e experienc ##e you ar ##e sur ##e to get . " " That may all be tru ##e , " said the Scarecrow , " but I shall be very unhappy unless you giv ##e me brains . " The false Wizard look ##ed at him carefully . " Well , " he said with a sigh , " I ' m not much of a magician , as I said ; but if you will com ##e to me tomorrow morning , I will stuff your head with brains . I cannot tell you how to us ##e them , however ; you must find that out for yourself . " " Oh , thank you - - thank you ! " cried the Scarecrow . " I ' ll find a way to us ##e them , never fear ! " " But how about my courag ##e ? " ask ##ed the Lion anxiously . " You hav ##e plenty of courag ##e , I am sur ##e , " answered Oz . " All you need is confidenc ##e in yourself . There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger . The Tru ##e courag ##e is in facing danger when you ar ##e afraid , and that kind of courag ##e you hav ##e in plenty . " " Perhaps I hav ##e , but I ' m scar ##ed just the sam ##e , " said the Lion . " I shall really be very unhappy unless you giv ##e me the sort of courag ##e that makes on ##e forget he is afraid . " " Very well , I will giv ##e you that sort of courag ##e tomorrow , " replied Oz . " How about my heart ? " ask ##ed the Tin Woodman . " Why , as for that , " answered Oz , " I think you ar ##e wrong to want a heart . It makes most people unhappy . If you only knew it , you ar ##e in luck not to hav ##e a heart . " " That must be a matter of opinion , " said the Tin Woodman . " For my part , I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur , if you will giv ##e me the heart . " " Very well , " answered Oz me ##e ##kly . " Com ##e to me tomorrow and you shall hav ##e a heart . I hav ##e played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continu ##e the part a little longer . " " And now , " said Dorothy , " how am I to get back to Kansas ? " " W ##e shall hav ##e to think about that , " replied the little man . " Giv ##e me two or three days to consider the matter and I ' ll try to find a way to carry you over the desert . In the meantim ##e you shall all be treat ##ed as my guests , and whil ##e you liv ##e in the Palac ##e my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish . There is only on ##e thing I ask in return for my help - - such as it is . You must keep my secret and tell no on ##e I am a humbug . " They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned , and went back to their rooms in high spirits . Even Dorothy had hop ##e that " The Gr ##e ##at and Terrible Humbug , " as sh ##e call ##ed him , would find a way to send her back to Kansas , and if he did sh ##e was willing to forgiv ##e him everything . 16 . The Magic Art of the Gr ##e ##at Humbug Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends : " Congratulat ##e me . I am going to Oz to get my brains at last . When I return I shall be as other men ar ##e . " " I hav ##e always lik ##ed you as you wer ##e , " said Dorothy simply . " It is kind of you to lik ##e a Scarecrow , " he replied . " But surely you will think mor ##e of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out . " Then he said good - by ##e to them all in a cheerful voic ##e and went to the Thron ##e Room , where he rapp ##ed upon the door . " Com ##e in , " said Oz . The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window , engag ##ed in deep thought . " I hav ##e com ##e for my brains , " remarked the Scarecrow , a little uneasily . " Oh , yes ; sit down in that chair , pleas ##e , " replied Oz . " You must excus ##e me for taking your head off , but I shall hav ##e to do it in order to put your brains in their proper plac ##e . " " That ' s all right , " said the Scarecrow . " You ar ##e quit ##e welcom ##e to tak ##e my head off , as long as it will be a better on ##e when you put it on again . " So the Wizard unfasten ##ed his head and empti ##ed out the straw . Then he enter ##ed the back room and took up a measur ##e of bran , which he mix ##ed with a great many pins and needles . Having shaken them together thoroughly , he fill ##ed the top of the Scarecrow ' s head with the mixtur ##e and stuff ##ed the rest of the spac ##e with straw , to hold it in plac ##e . When he had fasten ##ed the Scarecrow ' s head on his body again he said to him , " Hereafter you will be a great man , for I hav ##e given you a lot of bran - new brains . " The Scarecrow was both pleas ##ed and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish , and having thank ##ed Oz warmly he went back to his friends . Dorothy look ##ed at him curiously . His head was quit ##e bulg ##ed out at the top with brains . " How do you feel ? " sh ##e ask ##ed . " I feel wis ##e indeed , " he answered earnestly . " When I get us ##ed to my brains I shall know everything . " " Why ar ##e thos ##e needles and pins sticking out of your head ? " ask ##ed the Tin Woodman . " That is proof that he is sharp , " remarked the Lion . " Well , I must go to Oz and get my heart , " said the Woodman . So he walk ##ed to the Thron ##e Room and knock ##ed at the door . " Com ##e in , " call ##ed Oz , and the Woodman enter ##ed and said , " I hav ##e com ##e for my heart . " " Very well , " answered the little man . " But I shall hav ##e to cut a hol ##e in your breast , so I can put your heart in the right plac ##e . I hop ##e it won ' t hurt you . " " Oh , no , " answered the Woodman . " I shall not feel it at all . " So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith ' s shears and cut a small , squar ##e hol ##e in the left sid ##e of the Tin Woodman ' s breast . Then , going to a chest of drawers , he took out a pretty heart , mad ##e entirely of silk and stuff ##ed with sawdust . " Isn ' t it a beauty ? " he ask ##ed . " It is , indeed ! " replied the Woodman , who was greatly pleas ##ed . " But is it a kind heart ? " " Oh , very ! " answered Oz . H ##e put the heart in the Woodman ' s breast and then replaced the squar ##e of tin , soldering it neatly together where it had been cut . " There , " said he ; " now you hav ##e a heart that any man might be proud of . I ' m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast , but it really couldn ' t be help ##ed . " " Never mind the patch , " exclaimed the happy Woodman . " I am very grateful to you , and shall never forget your kindness . " " Don ' t speak of it , " replied Oz . Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends , who wish ##ed him every joy on account of his good fortun ##e . The Lion now walk ##ed to the Thron ##e Room and knock ##ed at the door . " Com ##e in , " said Oz . " I hav ##e com ##e for my courag ##e , " announc ##ed the Lion , entering the room . " Very well , " answered the little man ; " I will get it for you . " H ##e went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a squar ##e green bottle , the contents of which he poured into a green - gold dish , beautifully carved . Placing this befor ##e the Cowardly Lion , who sniff ##ed at it as if he did not lik ##e it , the Wizard said : " Drink . " " What is it ? " ask ##ed the Lion . " Well , " answered Oz , " if it wer ##e insid ##e of you , it would be courag ##e . You know , of course , that courag ##e is always insid ##e on ##e ; so that this really cannot be call ##ed courag ##e until you hav ##e swallow ##ed it . Therefor ##e I advis ##e you to drink it as soon as possible . " The Lion hesitat ##ed no longer , but drank till the dish was empty . " How do you feel now ? " ask ##ed Oz . " Full of courag ##e , " replied the Lion , who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortun ##e . Oz , left to himself , smil ##ed to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they want ##ed . " How can I help being a humbug , " he said , " when all thes ##e people mak ##e me do things that everybody knows can ' t be don ##e ? It was easy to mak ##e the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy , because they imagin ##ed I could do anything . But it will tak ##e mor ##e than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas , and I ' m sur ##e I don ' t know how it can be don ##e . " 17 . How the Balloon Was Launch ##ed For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz . Thes ##e wer ##e sad days for the little girl , although her friends wer ##e all quit ##e happy and content ##ed . The Scarecrow told them there wer ##e wonderful thoughts in his head ; but he would not say what they wer ##e because he knew no on ##e could understand them but himself . When the Tin Woodman walk ##ed about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast ; and he told Dorothy he had discover ##ed it to be a kinder and mor ##e tender heart than the on ##e he had own ##ed when he was mad ##e of flesh . The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth , and would gladly fac ##e an army or a dozen of the fierc ##e Kalidahs . Thus each of the little party was satisfi ##ed except Dorothy , who long ##ed mor ##e than ever to get back to Kansas . On the fourth day , to her great joy , Oz sent for her , and when sh ##e enter ##ed the Thron ##e Room he greeted her pleasantly : " Sit down , my dear ; I think I hav ##e found the way to get you out of this country . " " And back to Kansas ? " sh ##e ask ##ed eagerly . " Well , I ' m not sur ##e about Kansas , " said Oz , " for I haven ' t the faintest notion which way it lies . But the first thing to do is to cross the desert , and then it should be easy to find your way hom ##e . " " How can I cross the desert ? " sh ##e inquired . " Well , I ' ll tell you what I think , " said the little man . " You see , when I cam ##e to this country it was in a balloon . You also cam ##e through the air , being carried by a cyclon ##e . So I believ ##e the best way to get across the desert will be through the air . Now , it is quit ##e beyond my powers to mak ##e a cyclon ##e ; but I ' ve been thinking the matter over , and I believ ##e I can mak ##e a balloon . " " How ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " A balloon , " said Oz , " is mad ##e of silk , which is coat ##ed with glu ##e to keep the gas in it . I hav ##e plenty of silk in the Palac ##e , so it will be no trouble to mak ##e the balloon . But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with , to mak ##e it float . " " If it won ' t float , " remarked Dorothy , " it will be of no us ##e to us . " " Tru ##e , " answered Oz . " But there is another way to mak ##e it float , which is to fill it with hot air . Hot air isn ' t as good as gas , for if the air should get cold the balloon would com ##e down in the desert , and we should be lost . " " W ##e ! " exclaimed the girl . " Ar ##e you going with me ? " " Yes , of course , " replied Oz . " I am tired of being such a humbug . If I should go out of this Palac ##e my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard , and then they would be vexed with me for having deceiv ##ed them . So I hav ##e to stay shut up in thes ##e rooms all day , and it gets tiresom ##e . I ' d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again . " " I shall be glad to hav ##e your company , " said Dorothy . " Thank you , " he answered . " Now , if you will help me sew the silk together , we will begin to work on our balloon . " So Dorothy took a needle and thread , and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shap ##e the girl sew ##ed them neatly together . First there was a strip of light green silk , then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green ; for Oz had a fancy to mak ##e the balloon in different shades of the color about them . It took three days to sew all the strips together , but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk mor ##e than twenty feet long . Then Oz painted it on the insid ##e with a coat of thin glu ##e , to mak ##e it airtight , after which he announc ##ed that the balloon was ready . " But we must hav ##e a basket to rid ##e in , " he said . So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket , which he fasten ##ed with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon . When it was all ready , Oz sent word to his people that he was going to mak ##e a visit to a great brother Wizard who liv ##ed in the clouds . The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyon ##e cam ##e to see the wonderful sight . Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palac ##e , and the people gaz ##ed upon it with much curiosity . The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pil ##e of wood , and now he mad ##e a fir ##e of it , and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fir ##e so that the hot air that aros ##e from it would be caught in the silken bag . Gradually the balloon swell ##ed out and ros ##e into the air , until finally the basket just touch ##ed the ground . Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voic ##e : " I am now going away to mak ##e a visit . Whil ##e I am gon ##e the Scarecrow will rule over you . I command you to obey him as you would me . " The balloon was by this tim ##e tugging hard at the rop ##e that held it to the ground , for the air within it was hot , and this mad ##e it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to ris ##e into the sky . " Com ##e , Dorothy ! " cried the Wizard . " Hurry up , or the balloon will fly away . " " I can ' t find Toto anywher ##e , " replied Dorothy , who did not wish to leav ##e her little dog behind . Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten , and Dorothy at last found him . Sh ##e pick ##ed him up and ran towards the balloon . Sh ##e was within a few steps of it , and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket , when , crack ! went the ropes , and the balloon ros ##e into the air without her . " Com ##e back ! " sh ##e scream ##ed . " I want to go , too ! " " I can ' t com ##e back , my dear , " call ##ed Oz from the basket . " Good - by ##e ! " " Good - by ##e ! " shouted everyon ##e , and all eyes wer ##e turn ##ed upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket , rising every moment farther and farther into the sky . And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz , the Wonderful Wizard , though he may hav ##e reach ##ed Omaha safely , and be there now , for all we know . But the people remembered him lovingly , and said to on ##e another : " Oz was always our friend . When he was her ##e he built for us this beautiful Emerald City , and now he is gon ##e he has left the Wis ##e Scarecrow to rule over us . " Still , for many days they griev ##ed over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard , and would not be comforted . 18 . Away to the South Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hop ##e to get hom ##e to Kansas again ; but when sh ##e thought it all over sh ##e was glad sh ##e had not gon ##e up in a balloon . And sh ##e also felt sorry at losing Oz , and so did her companions . The Tin Woodman cam ##e to her and said : " Truly I should be ungrat ##ef ##ul if I fail ##ed to mourn for the man who gav ##e me my lovely heart . I should lik ##e to cry a little because Oz is gon ##e , if you will kindly wip ##e away my tears , so that I shall not rust . " " With pleasur ##e , " sh ##e answered , and brought a towel at onc ##e . Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes , and sh ##e watch ##ed the tears carefully and wip ##ed them away with the towel . When he had finished , he thank ##ed her kindly and oil ##ed himself thoroughly with his jewel ##ed oil - can , to guard against mishap . The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City , and although he was not a Wizard the people wer ##e proud of him . " For , " they said , " there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuff ##ed man . " And , so far as they knew , they wer ##e quit ##e right . The morning after the balloon had gon ##e up with Oz , the four travelers met in the Thron ##e Room and talk ##ed matters over . The Scarecrow sat in the big thron ##e and the others stood respect ##fully befor ##e him . " W ##e ar ##e not so unlucky , " said the new ruler , " for this Palac ##e and the Emerald City belong to us , and we can do just as we pleas ##e . When I remember that a short tim ##e ago I was up on a pol ##e in a farmer ' s cornfield , and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City , I am quit ##e satisfi ##ed with my lot . " " I also , " said the Tin Woodman , " am well - pleas ##ed with my new heart ; and , really , that was the only thing I wish ##ed in all the world . " " For my part , I am content in knowing I am as brav ##e as any beast that ever liv ##ed , if not braver , " said the Lion modestly . " If Dorothy would only be content ##ed to liv ##e in the Emerald City , " continu ##ed the Scarecrow , " we might all be happy together . " " But I don ' t want to liv ##e her ##e , " cried Dorothy . " I want to go to Kansas , and liv ##e with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry . " " Well , then , what can be don ##e ? " inquired the Woodman . The Scarecrow decid ##ed to think , and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains . Finally he said : " Why not call the Winged Monkeys , and ask them to carry you over the desert ? " " I never thought of that ! " said Dorothy joyfully . " It ' s just the thing . I ' ll go at onc ##e for the Golden Cap . " When sh ##e brought it into the Thron ##e Room sh ##e spok ##e the magic words , and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood besid ##e her . " This is the second tim ##e you hav ##e call ##ed us , " said the Monkey King , bowing befor ##e the little girl . " What do you wish ? " " I want you to fly with me to Kansas , " said Dorothy . But the Monkey King shook his head . " That cannot be don ##e , " he said . " W ##e belong to this country alon ##e , and cannot leav ##e it . There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet , and I suppos ##e there never will be , for they don ' t belong there . W ##e shall be glad to serv ##e you in any way in our power , but we cannot cross the desert . Good - by ##e . " And with another bow , the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window , follow ##ed by all his band . Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment . " I hav ##e wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpos ##e , " sh ##e said , " for the Winged Monkeys cannot help me . " " It is certainly too bad ! " said the tender - hearted Woodman . The Scarecrow was thinking again , and his head bulg ##ed out so horribly that Dorothy fear ##ed it would burst . " Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers , " he said , " and ask his advic ##e . " So the soldier was summon ##ed and enter ##ed the Thron ##e Room timidly , for whil ##e Oz was aliv ##e he never was allow ##ed to com ##e farther than the door . " This little girl , " said the Scarecrow to the soldier , " wishes to cross the desert . How can sh ##e do so ? " " I cannot tell , " answered the soldier , " for nobody has ever crossed the desert , unless it is Oz himself . " " Is there no on ##e who can help me ? " ask ##ed Dorothy earnestly . " Glinda might , " he suggested . " Who is Glinda ? " inquired the Scarecrow . " The Witch of the South . Sh ##e is the most powerful of all the Witches , and rules over the Quadlings . Besides , her castle stands on the edg ##e of the desert , so sh ##e may know a way to cross it . " " Glinda is a Good Witch , isn ' t sh ##e ? " ask ##ed the child . " The Quadlings think sh ##e is good , " said the soldier , " and sh ##e is kind to everyon ##e . I hav ##e heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman , who knows how to keep young in spit ##e of the many years sh ##e has liv ##ed . " " How can I get to her castle ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " The road is straight to the South , " he answered , " but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers . There ar ##e wild beasts in the woods , and a rac ##e of queer men who do not lik ##e strangers to cross their country . For this reason non ##e of the Quadlings ever com ##e to the Emerald City . " The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said : " It seems , in spit ##e of dangers , that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her . For , of course , if Dorothy stays her ##e sh ##e will never get back to Kansas . " " You must hav ##e been thinking again , " remarked the Tin Woodman . " I hav ##e , " said the Scarecrow . " I shall go with Dorothy , " declared the Lion , " for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again . I am really a wild beast , you know . Besides , Dorothy will need someon ##e to protect her . " " That is tru ##e , " agreed the Woodman . " My ax ##e may be of servic ##e to her ; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South . " " When shall we start ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . " Ar ##e you going ? " they ask ##ed , in surpris ##e . " Certainly . If it wasn ' t for Dorothy I should never hav ##e had brains . Sh ##e lifted me from the pol ##e in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City . So my good luck is all du ##e to her , and I shall never leav ##e her until sh ##e starts back to Kansas for good and all . " " Thank you , " said Dorothy gratefully . " You ar ##e all very kind to me . But I should lik ##e to start as soon as possible . " " W ##e shall go tomorrow morning , " return ##ed the Scarecrow . " So now let us all get ready , for it will be a long journey . " 19 . Attack ##ed by the Fighting Tr ##ee ##s The next morning Dorothy kiss ##ed the pretty green girl good - by ##e , and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers , who had walk ##ed with them as far as the gat ##e . When the Guardian of the Gat ##e saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leav ##e the beautiful City to get into new trouble . But he at onc ##e unlock ##ed their spectacles , which he put back into the green box , and gav ##e them many good wishes to carry with them . " You ar ##e now our ruler , " he said to the Scarecrow ; " so you must com ##e back to us as soon as possible . " " I certainly shall if I am able , " the Scarecrow replied ; " but I must help Dorothy to get hom ##e , first . " As Dorothy bad ##e the good - natur ##ed Guardian a last far ##ew ##ell sh ##e said : " I hav ##e been very kindly treat ##ed in your lovely City , and everyon ##e has been good to me . I cannot tell you how grateful I am . " " Don ' t try , my dear , " he answered . " W ##e should lik ##e to keep you with us , but if it is your wish to return to Kansas , I hop ##e you will find a way . " H ##e then open ##ed the gat ##e of the outer wall , and they walk ##ed forth and started upon their journey . The sun shon ##e brightly as our friends turn ##ed their faces toward the Land of the South . They wer ##e all in the best of spirits , and laugh ##ed and chatted together . Dorothy was onc ##e mor ##e fill ##ed with the hop ##e of getting hom ##e , and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman wer ##e glad to be of us ##e to her . As for the Lion , he sniff ##ed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from sid ##e to sid ##e in pur ##e joy at being in the country again , whil ##e Toto ran around them and chas ##ed the moths and butterflies , barking merrily all the tim ##e . " City lif ##e does not agree with me at all , " remarked the Lion , as they walk ##ed along at a brisk pac ##e . " I hav ##e lost much flesh sinc ##e I liv ##ed there , and now I am anxious for a chanc ##e to show the other beasts how courageous I hav ##e grown . " They now turn ##ed and took a last look at the Emerald City . All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls , and high up abov ##e everything the spires and dom ##e of the Palac ##e of Oz . " Oz was not such a bad Wizard , after all , " said the Tin Woodman , as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast . " H ##e knew how to giv ##e me brains , and very good brains , too , " said the Scarecrow . " If Oz had taken a dos ##e of the sam ##e courag ##e he gav ##e me , " add ##ed the Lion , " he would hav ##e been a brav ##e man . " Dorothy said nothing . Oz had not kept the promis ##e he mad ##e her , but he had don ##e his best , so sh ##e forgav ##e him . As he said , he was a good man , even if he was a bad Wizard . The first day ' s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretch ##ed about the Emerald City on every sid ##e . They slept that night on the grass , with nothing but the stars over them ; and they rest ##ed very well indeed . In the morning they travel ##ed on until they cam ##e to a thick wood . There was no way of going around it , for it seem ##ed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see ; and , besides , they did not dar ##e chang ##e the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost . So they look ##ed for the plac ##e where it would be easiest to get into the forest . The Scarecrow , who was in the lead , finally discover ##ed a big tre ##e with such wid ##e - spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass undern ##e ##ath . So he walk ##ed forward to the tre ##e , but just as he cam ##e under the first branches they bent down and twin ##ed around him , and the next minut ##e he was rais ##ed from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers . This did not hurt the Scarecrow , but it surpris ##ed him , and he look ##ed rather dizzy when Dorothy pick ##ed him up . " Her ##e is another spac ##e between the trees , " call ##ed the Lion . " Let me try it first , " said the Scarecrow , " for it doesn ' t hurt me to get thrown about . " H ##e walk ##ed up to another tre ##e , as he spok ##e , but its branches immediately seiz ##ed him and tossed him back again . " This is strang ##e , " exclaimed Dorothy . " What shall we do ? " " The trees seem to hav ##e mad ##e up their minds to fight us , and stop our journey , " remarked the Lion . " I believ ##e I will try it myself , " said the Woodman , and shouldering his ax ##e , he marched up to the first tre ##e that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly . When a big branch bent down to seiz ##e him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two . At onc ##e the tre ##e began shaking all its branches as if in pain , and the Tin Woodman pass ##ed safely under it . " Com ##e on ! " he shouted to the others . " Be quick ! " They all ran forward and pass ##ed under the tre ##e without injury , except Toto , who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled . But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free . The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back , so they mad ##e up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches , and that probably thes ##e wer ##e the polic ##em ##en of the forest , and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it . The four travelers walk ##ed with eas ##e through the trees until they cam ##e to the farther edg ##e of the wood . Then , to their surpris ##e , they found befor ##e them a high wall which seem ##ed to be mad ##e of whit ##e china . It was smooth , lik ##e the surfac ##e of a dish , and higher than their heads . " What shall we do now ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . " I will mak ##e a ladder , " said the Tin Woodman , " for we certainly must climb over the wall . " 20 . The Dainty China Country Whil ##e the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept , for sh ##e was tired by the long walk . The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay besid ##e him . The Scarecrow watch ##ed the Woodman whil ##e he work ##ed , and said to him : " I cannot think why this wall is her ##e , nor what it is mad ##e of . " " Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall , " replied the Woodman . " When we hav ##e climb ##ed over it , we shall know what is on the other sid ##e . " After a tim ##e the ladder was finished . It look ##ed clumsy , but the Tin Woodman was sur ##e it was strong and would answer their purpos ##e . The Scarecrow wak ##ed Dorothy and the Lion and Toto , and told them that the ladder was ready . The Scarecrow climb ##ed up the ladder first , but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow clos ##e behind and keep him from falling off . When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said , " Oh , my ! " " Go on , " exclaimed Dorothy . So the Scarecrow climb ##ed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall , and Dorothy put her head over and cried , " Oh , my ! " just as the Scarecrow had don ##e . Then Toto cam ##e up , and immediately began to bark , but Dorothy mad ##e him be still . The Lion climb ##ed the ladder next , and the Tin Woodman cam ##e last ; but both of them cried , " Oh , my ! " as soon as they look ##ed over the wall . When they wer ##e all sitting in a row on the top of the wall , they look ##ed down and saw a strang ##e sight . Befor ##e them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and whit ##e as the bottom of a big platter . Scatter ##ed around wer ##e many houses mad ##e entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors . Thes ##e houses wer ##e quit ##e small , the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy ' s waist . There wer ##e also pretty little barns , with china fences around them ; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens , all mad ##e of china , wer ##e standing about in groups . But the strangest of all wer ##e the people who liv ##ed in this queer country . There wer ##e milkmaids and shepherdesses , with brightly color ##ed bodices and golden spots all over their gowns ; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple ; and shepherds dress ##ed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blu ##e stripes down them , and golden buckles on their shoes ; and princes with jewel ##ed crowns upon their heads , wearing ermin ##e robes and satin doublets ; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns , with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall , pointed caps . And , strangest of all , thes ##e people wer ##e all mad ##e of china , even to their clothes , and wer ##e so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy ' s knee . No on ##e did so much as look at the travelers at first , except on ##e little purple china dog with an extra - larg ##e head , which cam ##e to the wall and bark ##ed at them in a tiny voic ##e , afterwards running away again . " How shall we get down ? " ask ##ed Dorothy . They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up , so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jump ##ed down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet . Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet . When all wer ##e safely down they pick ##ed up the Scarecrow , whos ##e body was quit ##e flatten ##ed out , and patted his straw into shap ##e again . " W ##e must cross this strang ##e plac ##e in order to get to the other sid ##e , " said Dorothy , " for it would be unwis ##e for us to go any other way except du ##e South . " They began walking through the country of the china people , and the first thing they cam ##e to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow . As they drew near , the cow suddenly gav ##e a kick and kick ##ed over the stool , the pail , and even the milkmaid herself , and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter . Dorothy was shock ##ed to see that the cow had broken her leg off , and that the pail was lying in several small pieces , whil ##e the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow . " There ! " cried the milkmaid angrily . " See what you hav ##e don ##e ! My cow has broken her leg , and I must tak ##e her to the mender ' s shop and hav ##e it glu ##ed on again . What do you mean by coming her ##e and frightening my cow ? " " I ' m very sorry , " return ##ed Dorothy . " Pleas ##e forgiv ##e us . " But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to mak ##e any answer . Sh ##e pick ##ed up the leg sulkily and led her cow away , the poor animal limping on three legs . As sh ##e left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers , holding her nick ##ed elbow clos ##e to her sid ##e . Dorothy was quit ##e griev ##ed at this mishap . " W ##e must be very careful her ##e , " said the kind - hearted Woodman , " or we may hurt thes ##e pretty little people so they will never get over it . " A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dress ##ed young Princess , who stopped short as sh ##e saw the strangers and started to run away . Dorothy want ##ed to see mor ##e of the Princess , so sh ##e ran after her . But the china girl cried out : " Don ' t chas ##e me ! Don ' t chas ##e me ! " Sh ##e had such a frighten ##ed little voic ##e that Dorothy stopped and said , " Why not ? " " Because , " answered the Princess , also stopping , a saf ##e distanc ##e away , " if I run I may fall down and break myself . " " But could you not be mend ##ed ? " ask ##ed the girl . " Oh , yes ; but on ##e is never so pretty after being mend ##ed , you know , " replied the Princess . " I suppos ##e not , " said Dorothy . " Now there is Mr . Joker , on ##e of our clowns , " continu ##ed the china lady , " who is always trying to stand upon his head . H ##e has broken himself so often that he is mend ##ed in a hundr ##ed places , and doesn ' t look at all pretty . Her ##e he comes now , so you can see for yourself . " Indeed , a jolly little clown cam ##e walking toward them , and Dorothy could see that in spit ##e of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely cover ##ed with cracks , running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mend ##ed in many places . The Clown put his hands in his pockets , and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily , he said : " My lady fair , Why do you star ##e At poor old Mr . Joker ? You ' re quit ##e as stiff And prim as if You ' d eaten up a poker ! " " Be quiet , sir ! " said the Princess . " Can ' t you see thes ##e ar ##e strangers , and should be treat ##ed with respect ? " " Well , that ' s respect , I expect , " declared the Clown , and immediately stood upon his head . " Don ' t mind Mr . Joker , " said the Princess to Dorothy . " H ##e is considerably crack ##ed in his head , and that makes him foolish . " " Oh , I don ' t mind him a bit , " said Dorothy . " But you ar ##e so beautiful , " sh ##e continu ##ed , " that I am sur ##e I could lov ##e you dearly . Won ' t you let me carry you back to Kansas , and stand you on Aunt Em ' s mantel ? I could carry you in my basket . " " That would mak ##e me very unhappy , " answered the china Princess . " You see , her ##e in our country we liv ##e contentedly , and can talk and mov ##e around as we pleas ##e . But whenever any of us ar ##e taken away our joints at onc ##e stiffen , and we can only stand straight and look pretty . Of course that is all that is expected of us when we ar ##e on mantels and cabinets and drawing - room tables , but our lives ar ##e much pleasanter her ##e in our own country . " " I would not mak ##e you unhappy for all the world ! " exclaimed Dorothy . " So I ' ll just say good - by ##e . " " Good - by ##e , " replied the Princess . They walk ##ed carefully through the china country . The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way , fearing the strangers would break them , and after an hour or so the travelers reach ##ed the other sid ##e of the country and cam ##e to another china wall . It was not so high as the first , however , and by standing upon the Lion ' s back they all manag ##ed to scramble to the top . Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jump ##ed on the wall ; but just as he jump ##ed , he upset a china church with his tail and smash ##ed it all to pieces . " That was too bad , " said Dorothy , " but really I think we wer ##e lucky in not doing thes ##e little people mor ##e harm than breaking a cow ' s leg and a church . They ar ##e all so brittle ! " " They ar ##e , indeed , " said the Scarecrow , " and I am thankful I am mad ##e of straw and cannot be easily damag ##ed . There ar ##e worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow . " 21 . The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country , full of bogs and marshes and cover ##ed with tall , rank grass . It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes , for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight . However , by carefully picking their way , they got safely along until they reach ##ed solid ground . But her ##e the country seem ##ed wilder than ever , and after a long and tiresom ##e walk through the underbrush they enter ##ed another forest , where the trees wer ##e bigger and older than any they had ever seen . " This forest is perf ##ect ##ly delightful , " declared the Lion , looking around him with joy . " Never hav ##e I seen a mor ##e beautiful plac ##e . " " It seems gloomy , " said the Scarecrow . " Not a bit of it , " answered the Lion . " I should lik ##e to liv ##e her ##e all my lif ##e . See how soft the dried leaves ar ##e under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to thes ##e old trees . Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter hom ##e . " " Perhaps there ar ##e wild beasts in the forest now , " said Dorothy . " I suppos ##e there ar ##e , " return ##ed the Lion , " but I do not see any of them about . " They walk ##ed through the forest until it becam ##e too dark to go any farther . Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep , whil ##e the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual . When morning cam ##e , they started again . Befor ##e they had gon ##e far they heard a low rumble , as of the growling of many wild animals . Toto whimpered a little , but non ##e of the others was frighten ##ed , and they kept along the well - trodden path until they cam ##e to an opening in the wood , in which wer ##e gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety . There wer ##e tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history , and for a moment Dorothy was afraid . But the Lion explained that the animals wer ##e holding a meeting , and he judg ##ed by their snarling and growling that they wer ##e in great trouble . As he spok ##e several of the beasts caught sight of him , and at onc ##e the great assemblag ##e hush ##ed as if by magic . The biggest of the tigers cam ##e up to the Lion and bow ##ed , saying : " Welcom ##e , O King of Beasts ! You hav ##e com ##e in good tim ##e to fight our enemy and bring peac ##e to all the animals of the forest onc ##e mor ##e . " " What is your trouble ? " ask ##ed the Lion quietly . " W ##e ar ##e all thr ##e ##atened , " answered the tiger , " by a fierc ##e enemy which has lately com ##e into this forest . It is a most tremendous monster , lik ##e a great spider , with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tre ##e trunk . It has eight of thes ##e long legs , and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth , where he eats it as a spider does a fly . Not on ##e of us is saf ##e whil ##e this fierc ##e creatur ##e is aliv ##e , and we had call ##ed a meeting to decid ##e how to tak ##e care of ourselves when you cam ##e among us . " The Lion thought for a moment . " Ar ##e there any other lions in this forest ? " he ask ##ed . " No ; there wer ##e some , but the monster has eaten them all . And , besides , they wer ##e non ##e of them nearly so larg ##e and brav ##e as you . " " If I put an end to your enemy , will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest ? " inquired the Lion . " W ##e will do that gladly , " return ##ed the tiger ; and all the other beasts roar ##ed with a mighty roar : " W ##e will ! " " Wher ##e is this great spider of yours now ? " ask ##ed the Lion . " Yonder , among the oak trees , " said the tiger , pointing with his forefoot . " Tak ##e good care of thes ##e friends of min ##e , " said the Lion , " and I will go at onc ##e to fight the monster . " H ##e bad ##e his comrades good - by ##e and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy . The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him , and it look ##ed so ugly that its fo ##e turn ##ed up his nos ##e in disgust . Its legs wer ##e quit ##e as long as the tiger had said , and its body cover ##ed with coarse black hair . It had a great mouth , with a row of sharp teeth a foot long ; but its head was join ##ed to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp ' s waist . This gav ##e the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creatur ##e , and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awak ##e , he gav ##e a great spring and land ##ed directly upon the monster ' s back . Then , with on ##e blow of his heavy paw , all arm ##ed with sharp claws , he knock ##ed the spider ' s head from its body . Jumping down , he watch ##ed it until the long legs stopped wiggling , when he knew it was quit ##e dead . The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest wer ##e waiting for him and said proudly : " You need fear your enemy no longer . " Then the beasts bow ##ed down to the Lion as their King , and he promis ##ed to com ##e back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas . 22 . The Country of the Quadlings The four travelers pass ##ed through the rest of the forest in safety , and when they cam ##e out from its gloom saw befor ##e them a steep hill , cover ##ed from top to bottom with great pieces of rock . " That will be a hard climb , " said the Scarecrow , " but we must get over the hill , nevertheless . " So he led the way and the others follow ##ed . They had nearly reach ##ed the first rock when they heard a rough voic ##e cry out , " Keep back ! " " Who ar ##e you ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . Then a head show ##ed itself over the rock and the sam ##e voic ##e said , " This hill belongs to us , and we don ' t allow anyon ##e to cross it . " " But we must cross it , " said the Scarecrow . " W ##e ' re going to the country of the Quadlings . " " But you shall not ! " replied the voic ##e , and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen . H ##e was quit ##e short and stout and had a big head , which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles . But he had no arms at all , and , seeing this , the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creatur ##e could prevent them from climbing the hill . So he said , " I ' m sorry not to do as you wish , but we must pass over your hill whether you lik ##e it or not , " and he walk ##ed boldly forward . As quick as lightning the man ' s head shot forward and his neck stretch ##ed out until the top of the head , where it was flat , struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling , over and over , down the hill . Almost as quickly as it cam ##e the head went back to the body , and the man laugh ##ed harshly as he said , " It isn ' t as easy as you think ! " A chorus of boisterous laughter cam ##e from the other rocks , and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer - Heads upon the hillsid ##e , on ##e behind every rock . The Lion becam ##e quit ##e angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow ' s mishap , and giving a loud roar that echo ##ed lik ##e thunder , he dashed up the hill . Again a head shot swiftly out , and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball . Dorothy ran down and help ##ed the Scarecrow to his feet , and the Lion cam ##e up to her , feeling rather bruis ##ed and sor ##e , and said , " It is useless to fight people with shooting heads ; no on ##e can withstand them . " " What can we do , then ? " sh ##e ask ##ed . " Call the Winged Monkeys , " suggested the Tin Woodman . " You hav ##e still the right to command them onc ##e mor ##e . " " Very well , " sh ##e answered , and putting on the Golden Cap sh ##e utter ##ed the magic words . The Monkeys wer ##e as prompt as ever , and in a few moments the entir ##e band stood befor ##e her . " What ar ##e your commands ? " inquired the King of the Monkeys , bowing low . " Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings , " answered the girl . " It shall be don ##e , " said the King , and at onc ##e the Winged Monkeys caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them . As they pass ##ed over the hill the Hammer - Heads yell ##ed with vexation , and shot their heads high in the air , but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys , which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings . " This is the last tim ##e you can summon us , " said the leader to Dorothy ; " so good - by ##e and good luck to you . " " Good - by ##e , and thank you very much , " return ##ed the girl ; and the Monkeys ros ##e into the air and wer ##e out of sight in a twinkling . The country of the Quadlings seem ##ed rich and happy . There was field upon field of ripening grain , with well - paved roads running between , and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them . The fences and houses and bridges wer ##e all painted bright red , just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blu ##e in the country of the Munchkins . The Quadlings themselves , who wer ##e short and fat and look ##ed chubby and good - natur ##ed , wer ##e dress ##ed all in red , which show ##ed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain . The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhous ##e , and the four travelers walk ##ed up to it and knock ##ed at the door . It was open ##ed by the farmer ' s wif ##e , and when Dorothy ask ##ed for something to eat the woman gav ##e them all a good dinner , with three kinds of cak ##e and four kinds of cookies , and a bowl of milk for Toto . " How far is it to the Castle of Glinda ? " ask ##ed the child . " It is not a great way , " answered the farmer ' s wif ##e . " Tak ##e the road to the South and you will soon reach it . Thanking the good woman , they started afresh and walk ##ed by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw befor ##e them a very beautiful Castle . Befor ##e the gates wer ##e three young girls , dress ##ed in handsom ##e red uniforms trimm ##ed with gold braid ; and as Dorothy approach ##ed , on ##e of them said to her : " Why hav ##e you com ##e to the South Country ? " " To see the Good Witch who rules her ##e , " sh ##e answered . " Will you tak ##e me to her ? " " Let me hav ##e your nam ##e , and I will ask Glinda if sh ##e will receiv ##e you . " They told who they wer ##e , and the girl soldier went into the Castle . After a few moments sh ##e cam ##e back to say that Dorothy and the others wer ##e to be admitted at onc ##e . 23 . Glinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy ' s Wish Befor ##e they went to see Glinda , however , they wer ##e taken to a room of the Castle , where Dorothy wash ##ed her fac ##e and comb ##ed her hair , and the Lion shook the dust out of his man ##e , and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shap ##e , and the Woodman polished his tin and oil ##ed his joints . When they wer ##e all quit ##e presentable they follow ##ed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a thron ##e of rubies . Sh ##e was both beautiful and young to their eyes . Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders . Her dress was pur ##e whit ##e but her eyes wer ##e blu ##e , and they look ##ed kindly upon the little girl . " What can I do for you , my child ? " sh ##e ask ##ed . Dorothy told the Witch all her story : how the cyclon ##e had brought her to the Land of Oz , how sh ##e had found her companions , and of the wonderful adventures they had met with . " My greatest wish now , " sh ##e add ##ed , " is to get back to Kansas , for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happen ##ed to me , and that will mak ##e her put on mourning ; and unless the crops ar ##e better this year than they wer ##e last , I am sur ##e Uncle Henry cannot afford it . " Glinda leaned forward and kiss ##ed the sweet , upturn ##ed fac ##e of the loving little girl . " Bless your dear heart , " sh ##e said , " I am sur ##e I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas . " Then sh ##e add ##ed , " But , if I do , you must giv ##e me the Golden Cap . " " Willingly ! " exclaimed Dorothy ; " indeed , it is of no us ##e to me now , and when you hav ##e it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times . " " And I think I shall need their servic ##e just thos ##e three times , " answered Glinda , smiling . Dorothy then gav ##e her the Golden Cap , and the Witch said to the Scarecrow , " What will you do when Dorothy has left us ? " " I will return to the Emerald City , " he replied , " for Oz has mad ##e me its ruler and the people lik ##e me . The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer - Heads . " " By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City , " said Glinda , " for it would be a sham ##e to depriv ##e the people of so wonderful a ruler . " " Am I really wonderful ? " ask ##ed the Scarecrow . " You ar ##e unusual , " replied Glinda . Turning to the Tin Woodman , sh ##e ask ##ed , " What will becom ##e of you when Dorothy leaves this country ? " H ##e leaned on his ax ##e and thought a moment . Then he said , " The Winkies wer ##e very kind to me , and want ##ed me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch di ##ed . I am fond of the Winkies , and if I could get back again to the Country of the West , I should lik ##e nothing better than to rule over them forever . " " My second command to the Winged Monkeys , " said Glinda " will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies . Your brain may not be so larg ##e to look at as thos ##e of the Scarecrow , but you ar ##e really brighter than he is - - when you ar ##e well polished - - and I am sur ##e you will rule the Winkies wisely and well . " Then the Witch look ##ed at the big , shaggy Lion and ask ##ed , " When Dorothy has return ##ed to her own hom ##e , what will becom ##e of you ? " " Over the hill of the Hammer - Heads , " he answered , " lies a grand old forest , and all the beasts that liv ##e there hav ##e mad ##e me their King . If I could only get back to this forest , I would pass my lif ##e very happily there . " " My third command to the Winged Monkeys , " said Glinda , " shall be to carry you to your forest . Then , having us ##ed up the powers of the Golden Cap , I shall giv ##e it to the King of the Monkeys , that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermor ##e . " The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thank ##ed the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness ; and Dorothy exclaimed : " You ar ##e certainly as good as you ar ##e beautiful ! But you hav ##e not yet told me how to get back to Kansas . " " Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert , " replied Glinda . " If you had known their power you could hav ##e gon ##e back to your Aunt Em the very first day you cam ##e to this country . " " But then I should not hav ##e had my wonderful brains ! " cried the Scarecrow . " I might hav ##e pass ##ed my whol ##e lif ##e in the farmer ' s cornfield . " " And I should not hav ##e had my lovely heart , " said the Tin Woodman . " I might hav ##e stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world . " " And I should hav ##e liv ##ed a coward forever , " declared the Lion , " and no beast in all the forest would hav ##e had a good word to say to me . " " This is all tru ##e , " said Dorothy , " and I am glad I was of us ##e to thes ##e good friends . But now that each of them has had what he most desir ##ed , and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides , I think I should lik ##e to go back to Kansas . " " The Silver Shoes , " said the Good Witch , " hav ##e wonderful powers . And on ##e of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any plac ##e in the world in three steps , and each step will be mad ##e in the wink of an ey ##e . All you hav ##e to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go . " " If that is so , " said the child joyfully , " I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at onc ##e . " Sh ##e threw her arms around the Lion ' s neck and kiss ##ed him , patting his big head tenderly . Then sh ##e kiss ##ed the Tin Woodman , who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints . But sh ##e hugged the soft , stuff ##ed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted fac ##e , and found sh ##e was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades . Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby thron ##e to giv ##e the little girl a good - by ##e kiss , and Dorothy thank ##ed her for all the kindness sh ##e had shown to her friends and herself . Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms , and having said on ##e last good - by ##e sh ##e clapp ##ed the heels of her shoes together three times , saying : " Tak ##e me hom ##e to Aunt Em ! " Instantly sh ##e was whirling through the air , so swiftly that all sh ##e could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears . The Silver Shoes took but three steps , and then sh ##e stopped so suddenly that sh ##e rolled over upon the grass several times befor ##e sh ##e knew where sh ##e was . At length , however , sh ##e sat up and look ##ed about her . " Good gracious ! " sh ##e cried . For sh ##e was sitting on the broad Kansas prairi ##e , and just befor ##e her was the new farmhous ##e Uncle Henry built after the cyclon ##e had carried away the old on ##e . Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard , and Toto had jump ##ed out of her arms and was running toward the barn , barking furiously . Dorothy stood up and found sh ##e was in her stocking - feet . For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air , and wer ##e lost forever in the desert . 24 . Hom ##e Again Aunt Em had just com ##e out of the house to water the cabbages when sh ##e look ##ed up and saw Dorothy running toward her . " My darling child ! " sh ##e cried , folding the little girl in her arms and covering her fac ##e with kisses . " Wher ##e in the world did you com ##e from ? " " From the Land of Oz , " said Dorothy gravely . " And her ##e is Toto , too . And oh , Aunt Em ! I ' m so glad to be at hom ##e again ! "
