 Can you please tell the jury why you're here today? Miss Herd accused of abuse. My ex-husband is suing me. Brutal, cruel. This is humiliating for any human being to go through. And all false. Amber heard forever changed Mr. Dep's life and reputation. Behind the fame, you're going to see who the real Johnny Dep is. Dep was the one who wanted the cameras in the courtroom. She did. I would argue it's a PR campaign, disguised as a defamation case. There's the man himself. It's being a social media circus of commentary from creators and influencers. Did you commit any kind of prank? Absolutely not. On my side of the bed was human fecal matter. I don't know. Ha ha ha. This has moved away from a new story or a lawsuit. And it's transformed into a cultural moment. People are live tweeting. People are live streaming. Where does it end? The engagement is phenomenal. Videos can be very easily manipulated every published. We're being influenced by bots interacting with bots. Johnny Depp is clearly winning right now in the court of public opinion. I've never been so scared in my life. She's acting. This trial is about so much more than Johnny Depp versus Amber Heard. Why are we also fascinated with this case? Because they're famous because of the details. What did it the jury see? It just kicked me. It didn't happen. I don't know who to believe. I was hitting you. It's her. Mr. Depa's your victim, isn't he? This is not so much about the legal marriage, but rather what the public perception is. And that leaves us to the real question, which is, what is the actual truth? I'm sorry.
